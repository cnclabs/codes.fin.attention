item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business franchisees are independent operators and are not employed by us 
we provided training and support to franchisees  but any number of factors beyond our control may diminish the quality of franchised restaurant operations 
consequently  franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel 
if franchisees do not operate in accordance with our standards  our image and reputation may suffer materially and system wide sales could significantly decline 
also  the presence of franchised restaurants may limit our ability to expand in a desired market 
our operations are susceptible to changes in food availability and costs  which could adversely affect our operating results our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
we rely on sysco corporation  a national distributor  as the primary supplier of our food 
any increase in distribution prices or failure of sysco to perform could cause our food costs to increase 
there also could be a significant short term disruption in our supply chain if sysco failed to meet our distribution requirements or our relationship was terminated 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  governmental regulation  production  availability and seasonality may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results of operations our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of the menu items served in the champps environment and our dining style 
for example  the recent popularity of low carbohydrate diets has caused us to modify our menu and add approximately eight carb consious items to our menu 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially and adversely affect our future profitability 
in addition  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
health concerns relating to the consumption of our food products could negatively impact our results of operations we are subject to the risk that consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of particular food products 
beef and chicken are the key ingredients in many of our menu items 
negative publicity concerning food quality  illness and injury  publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us  or other dietary and health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants 
if we lose the services of our president or other key associates  our business could suffer our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of william h 
baumhauer  our president and chief executive officer  as well as other key executives 
our future performance will depend on our ability to motivate and retain mr 
baumhauer and other executive officers and key associates  such as regional directors of operation  restaurant general managers and kitchen managers 
competition for these associates is intense 
in may  mr 
baumhauer s employment agreement was amended and extended through june  the loss of the services of mr 
baumhauer or members of our senior management and key associates or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business 
we do not currently have key person life insurance for any of our officers or directors 
we face indemnification liability from our predecessor companies in connection with the spin off of daka international daka in late  we assumed certain contingent liabilities of daka and its subsidiary  daka  inc daka 
under our post closing covenant agreement with daka  we are responsible for handling the defense of these claims  including the appeals 
in march  a former associate of daka was awarded approximately million in compensatory damages  million in punitive damages and million in legal fees in a jury trial based on the associate s claim of negligent supervision and retaliation due to alleged conduct that occurred in at a former daka food service location 
on september   daka filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the court of appeals affirmed the award of compensatory damages in the amount of  and attorneys fees in the amount of  however  the court of appeals vacated the million punitive damages award as constitutionally excessive and remanded the case to the trial court for re determination of punitive damages in accordance with legal principles outlined in its opinion 
in january we paid approximately million for compensatory damages and attorney s fees including interest 
on remand  by order dated may   the trial court awarded punitive damages in the amount of  we accrued a liability for the full amount of this award in the fourth quarter of fiscal on july   daka filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeals for the district of columbia and this matter is now pending in that court 
in addition  on june   plaintiff s counsel filed a motion for additional attorney s fees in the amount of  daka plans to vigorously oppose this motion and in the event the trial court grants the motion for attorneys fees in whole or in part  daka plans to file a notice of appeal for the award of the legal fees 
depending on the timing and nature of the ruling by the court of appeals  we also could incur substantial additional legal expenses in pursuing daka s appeal and the ultimate resolution of this matter 
we provide reserves in our financial statements for these and other matters 
the approximate amounts of these reserves are reviewed periodically to determine their adequacy 
although we believe that our current reserves are adequate in light of our analyses of the potential outcomes of the matters  there can be no guarantees that we will not have to recognize additional charges as these matters are ultimately resolved 
any resulting charges could be significant 
litigation could have a material adverse affect on our business we are subject to complaints or allegations from current and former or prospective associates from time to time 
in addition  we are subject to complaints or litigation from guests alleging discrimination  illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid  whether we are liable  or whether such allegations involve one of our franchisees or licensees 
a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision or result that could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we are also subject to state dram shop laws and regulations  which generally provide that a person injured by an intoxicated person may seek to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcohol to such person 
while we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance  we may still be subject to a judgment in excess of our insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain or continue to maintain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs  or at all 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  it could reduce our ability to capitalize on our brand names pursuant to a master agreement dated february   we acquired the champps  champ s and champps americana service mark  trademark and trade name 
our business prospects depend  in part  on our ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of the champps name and logo 
our trademarks could be infringed in ways that leave us without redress  such as by imitation 
in addition  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  and we employ various methods to protect our concepts and recipes 
however  such methods may not afford adequate protection and others could independently develop similar know how or obtain access to our know how  concepts and recipes 
moreover  we may face claims of infringement that could both interfere with our use of our proprietary know how  concepts  recipes  trade secrets or trademarks or subject us to damages 
defending against such claims may be costly and  if unsuccessful  may prevent us from continuing to use such proprietary information in the future 
although champps  champ s and champps americana are federally registered trademarks  there are other restaurants and bars that operate under similar names 
if these restaurants or bars are affected by negative publicity and consumers confuse these competitors with our champps branded restaurants  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulations including  but not limited to  the sale and serving of alcoholic beverages and wages paid to our associates that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to expand and develop our restaurants the restaurant industry is subject to various federal  state and local governmental regulations 
while at this time we have been able to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental licenses  permits and approvals  the failure to maintain these licenses  permits and approvals  including food and liquor licenses  could adversely affect our operating results 
difficulties or failure in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants 
local authorities may suspend  revoke or deny renewal of our food and liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct or facilities do not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations 
smoking bans in some locations could also have an adverse effect on our business 
for fiscal  approximately of our restaurant food and beverage sales was attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages  and we believe our ability to serve these beverages is an important factor in attracting guests 
alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and  in certain locations  county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on sundays 
typically  licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time  which could include sales to minors or intoxicated persons 
alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our restaurants 
the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain liquor or food service licenses would adversely affect the restaurant s operations 
various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our associates and affect our operating costs 
these laws include minimum wage requirements  overtime pay  unemployment tax rates  workers compensation rates  and citizenship requirements 
additional government imposed increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leave of absence and mandated health benefits  increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for associates who receive gratuities or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements could harm our operating results 
we are also subject to the ada which may increase the cost of construction or remodeling 
on june   the united states supreme court ruled that the internal revenue service irs can use aggregate tip estimates to ensure that the employer is paying fica taxes on allegedly underreported tips 
under the ruling  the irs does not need to examine individual associates records and it is permissible for the irs to estimate the amount of cash tips given to associates based on tips included on credit card receipts 
the reporting of tips is the responsibility of the associates receiving the tips 
we encourage our associates to abide by the law and report of the tips that they receive 
while we believe our associates adequately report tips  we have implemented tip reporting policies and procedures that are in full compliance with the recommended irs policies and procedures as defined in our tip reporting alternative commitment agreement that was executed by the company and the irs in fiscal our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the restaurant industry the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
although we believe that our operating concept  quality of food  ambiance and overall dining experience differentiates us from competitors  we may be unable to compete effectively with new restaurant concepts or with larger  better established competitors  which have substantially greater financial resources and operating histories than ours 
we may not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize our income tax operating loss and credit carryforwards as of june   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and fica tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal nol s expire at various times through and the fica tip tax credits expire at various times through while we expect to fully utilize the carryforwards to reduce our income tax liabilities  future income may not be sufficient for full utilization of the carryforwards 
our revenues may be adversely impacted by work stoppages  strikes or lock outs associated with professional sports teams a portion of our revenues are generated from patrons who eat and drink at champps while watching sports events 
a work stoppage  strike or lock out by any professional sports league would adversely impact our revenues 
our financial results are subject to fluctuations due to the seasonal nature of our business our sales fluctuate seasonally and therefore our quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
for fiscal years and  our relative sales were highest in our second quarter october through december  followed by our third quarter january through march  then by our fourth quarter april through june 
our first quarter july through september recorded the lowest relative sales for those years 
factors influencing sales variability in addition to those noted above include the frequency and popularity of sporting events  holidays including which day of the week the holiday occurs and weather 
strategic alternatives from time to time  as a matter of standard business practice  our management investigates various strategic alternatives in an attempt to maximize shareholder value 
these strategic alternatives include potential acquisitions  mergers with other companies and going private transactions 
as of september   the company has not entered into any definitive agreements relative to any strategic alternative that has been considered or brought before management 
should a material strategic alternative be presented that has the potential to maximize shareholder value  the board of directors would assign an independent committee to determine the merits of the proposed transaction and seek shareholder approval  if necessary 
item properties 
the company leases approximately  square feet of office space at its corporate headquarters in littleton douglas county  colorado  at an average annual rent of  the lease term for the office space ends october see item business operating locations for a listing of the company s owned and franchised restaurant locations  which is incorporated herein by reference 
item legal proceedings 
in connection with the spin off of daka international  inc daka in late  we assumed certain contingent liabilities of daka and its subsidiary  daka  inc under our post closing covenant agreement with daka  we are responsible for handling the defense of these claims  including the appeals 
in march  a former associate of daka was awarded approximately million in compensatory damages  million in punitive damages and million in legal fees in a jury trial mccrae vs 
daka based on the associate s claim of negligent supervision and retaliation due to alleged conduct that occurred in at a former daka food service location 
on september   daka filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the court of appeals affirmed the award of compensatory damages in the amount of  and attorneys fees in the amount of  however  the court of appeals vacated the million punitive damages award as constitutionally excessive and remanded the case to the trial court for redetermination of punitive damages in accordance with legal principles outlined in its opinion 
in january we paid approximately million for compensatory damages and attorney s fees including interest 
on remand  by order dated may   the trial court awarded punitive damages in the amount of  we accrued a liability for the full amount of this award in the fourth quarter of fiscal on july   daka filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeals for the district of columbia and this matter is now pending in that court 
in addition on june   plaintiff s counsel filed a motion for additional attorney s fees in the amount of  daka plans to vigorously oppose this motion and in the event the trial court grants the motion for attorneys fees in whole or in part  daka plans to file a notice of appeal for the award of the legal fees 
we have not accrued for these additional attorney s fees 
depending on the timing and nature of the ruling by the court of appeals  we also could incur substantial additional legal expenses in pursuing daka s appeal and the ultimate resolution of this matter 
revisions to our estimated loss of  may be made in the future and will be reported in the period in which additional information is known 
based upon our analysis  and the advice of outside legal counsel  the company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have any further material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the state of florida proposed to assess subsidiaries of daka million in unpaid state sales taxes  and an additional million in penalties and interest through december we were contractually obligated to indemnify daka for this matter 
in february  we entered into a settlement agreement with the florida department of revenue and paid million in full settlement of this matter 
we are engaged in various other actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe based on management s analyses and the advice of outside counsel that the ultimate collective outcome of these other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of june   we had an aggregate of approximately million reserved for liabilities associated with predecessor companies  almost all of which related to the daka associate judgment noted above 
these amounts have been reserved as a result of the trial court award of punitive damages 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders 
there were no matters submitted by the company to a vote of shareholders  through solicitation or proxies or otherwise  during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for which this report is filed 
part ii item market for the registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market nasdaq under the symbol cmpp 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the high and low sales prices per share for the common stock as reported by nasdaq 
high low fiscal first fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter fourth fiscal quarter fiscal first fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter fourth fiscal quarter on august   there were approximately  holders of record of the company s common stock

we have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
also  the company s credit arrangements restrict the amount of dividend payments or capital stock repurchases to a maximum amount of million over a three year period beginning march moreover  certain financial covenant ratios under the credit facilities require a minimum amount of tangible net worth  as defined in the related agreements 
item selected financial data 
selected financial data the following table presents selected consolidated data from continuing operations and balance sheet data of the company 
the balance sheet data as of june   june   june   july  and july  and the statements of operations data for each of the five fiscal years in the period ended june  presented below are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements 
certain amounts have been reclassified for earlier periods to conform to the fiscal presentation 
the reclassifications have no impact on net income or income per share 
the selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of the company and management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a restaurant company competing in the upscale casual market 
as of june   we owned and operated  and franchised  upscale  full service  casual dining restaurants under one of the following names champps americana  champps restaurant or champps restaurant and bar 
we operate and franchise restaurants in states with larger concentrations of restaurants in the upper midwest  mid atlantic and texas 
champps provides an extensive menu of approximately items consisting of high quality ingredients  freshly prepared and served with exceptional service in an exciting environment through the use of videos  music  sports and promotions 
our restaurants generally are open seven days a week from am to am we serve our guests in the dining room and bar area during lunch  after work  during dinner and after dinner during our late night period 
since june  we have positioned ourselves to increase profitability while embarking on a strategic expansion in major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
prior to june  we disposed of all non champps operating businesses and began to concentrate solely on the champps concept 
at june  we owned restaurants 
in fiscal year  we opened four restaurants and acquired two franchised restaurants 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we opened four  six and seven restaurants  respectively 
in fiscal  we opened seven additional locations and had fully executed contracts for three additional locations expected to open in fiscal we have identified other potential sites and are negotiating contracts on additional sites for restaurants to be opened in fiscal we expect to open a total of six new company operated restaurants in fiscal our new restaurants typically range in size from  square feet to  square feet 
historically since  restaurants with a ground lease have required  on average  a net cash investment of approximately million and average total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant 
restaurants constructed with build to suit financing have required  on average  a net cash investment of million and average total invested capital of approximately million which includes land acquisition cost 
pre opening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity for funding our operations and expansion have been net cash from operations  and standard restaurant financing methods  such as build to suit transactions  sale leaseback transactions  mortgage facilities  notes payable  tenant improvement allowances and equipment financing 
we recently secured a three year million revolving bank credit facility giving us greater financial flexibility and future interest expense savings 
in that regard  certain of our higher interest rate notes payable and capital leases as well as certain operating leases were repaid in the third and fourth quarters of with excess cash and use of this bank facility  although we were subject to prepayment penalties and a write off of related debt issuance costs 
because we continue to expand  the timing of revenues and expenses associated with opening new restaurants is expected to result in fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results 
in addition  our results  and the results of the restaurant industry as a whole  may be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes  discretionary spending priorities  national  regional and local economic conditions  demographic trends  consumer confidence in the economy  traffic patterns  weather conditions  employee availability  state and federal minimum wage requirements and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
changes in any of these factors could adversely affect us and our financial results 
the success of our business and our operating results are also dependent upon our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and liquor costs and the mix between food and liquor revenues 
various factors beyond our control  such as adverse weather conditions  may affect food costs and increases in federal  state and local taxes may affect liquor costs 
while we have been able to manage our exposure to the risk of increasing food and liquor costs in the past through certain purchasing practices  menu changes and price adjustments  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future or that changes in our sales mix or our overall buying power will not adversely affect our results of operations 
many food product costs have increased substantially in this recent fiscal year 
the most notable products with higher costs that affected our operations included beef  dairy and chicken wings 
we responded to these higher costs by raising prices on select menu items and adjusting recipes 
an important indicator of sales performance within the restaurant industry is comparable sales or same store sales 
this indicator compares the revenue performance of our restaurants open for more than sixty six weeks to the same restaurants in the prior year thereby eliminating the impact of new openings in comparing the operations of existing stores 
small changes in comparable sales can have a proportionally higher impact on operating margins because of the high degree of fixed costs associated with operating restaurants 
our comparable food sales have been positive for nine consecutive quarters and for out of the last quarters 
however  at the same time  comparable alcohol sales have been negative for nine consecutive quarters 
the following table provides our comparable sales percentage change by quarter versus the prior years comparable quarter for the last three fiscal years 
quarter quarter quarter quarter total fiscal food alcohol total fiscal food alcohol total fiscal food alcohol total we believe that alcohol sales have been impacted by our strategy to deemphasize our late night business beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the sluggish economy  competition  fluctuating consumer confidence  higher unemployment  decreases in discretionary income and a decline in overall on premise alcohol sales throughout our industry 
in june after reviewing competitor prices  we increased our alcohol prices 
our average weekly sales per restaurant has been decreasing over the last several years as our new stores have lower average weekly sales than our existing stores due in part to their reduced size 
food safety issues have received increased media attention during this past year 
two prominent issues have been the identification of green onions grown in farms in mexico as the source of hepatitis and the first reported case of mad cow disease in the united states 
we know of no known cases related to these food safety concerns affecting our restaurants 
we have received assurances from our produce provider of green onions that their sources are safe 
also  we have reinforced to our restaurant operators procedures to follow for the safe food handling of green onions 
to date  the mad cow disease issue has not been shown to influence the beef eating habits of consumers per industry reports  although future cases could certainly influence our customers eating habits 
the usda and the beef industry have taken a number of actions to reduce the risk of mad cow diseased beef from entering consumer markets 
as is fairly typical during most election years  proposals to increase minimum wage levels have once again surfaced at the federal level 
in addition  certain states where we do business have legislative proposals to increase their minimum wage levels 
while most of our kitchen staff are paid in excess of minimum wage levels and would not be affected by the proposals  our server and bar staff are generally paid the tipped minimum wage 
recently  the popularity of the atkins diet has resulted in many restaurant chains incorporating and promoting high protein  low carbohydrate items on their menus 
we responded to this trend by including certain menu items labeled carb conscious in our specials section of the menu starting in the third quarter of fiscal we added a carb conscious section to our menu in june in the last fiscal year  two of our restaurants operations were negatively impacted by local ordinances prohibiting smoking in public places 
these smoking bans are becoming more prevalent at both state and local levels 
state mandated smoking bans have not historically impacted our operations while locality specific bans have negatively affected our operations due to the ability of smoking patrons to choose smoking venues in other close localities that do not have a smoking ban 
we have been liable for two potentially significant loss contingencies related to a predecessor company see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
significant developments have occurred this last fiscal year in both items 
in the mccrae vs 
daka matter  the court of appeals issued its decision in december the court affirmed the award of compensatory damages in the amount of  and attorneys fees in the amount of  however  the court vacated the million punitive damages award as constitutionally excessive and remanded the case to the trial court for redetermination of punitive damages in accordance with legal principles outlined in its opinion 
in january  we paid approximately million for these items including interest 
in may  the trial court made its redetermination and awarded million in punitive damages to the plaintiff 
we accrued this amount as a predecessor cost in the fourth quarter of fiscal even though we have appealed the punitive damage redetermination award 
we have not accrued for million of additional attorney s fees sought by plaintiff s counsel as we do not believe the liability is probable 
the state of florida proposed sales tax assessment including penalties and interest was settled in february for a payment of million 
previously  the state of florida had proposed to assess million in unpaid state sales taxes  and an additional million in penalties and interest as of december our financial results for the year ended june  included growth of consolidated revenues by to million 
growth of income before income taxes by to million from million 
a decrease of net income of million to million 
fiscal net income was higher in part because we recorded a million income tax benefit related to a decrease in the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed by us to be reasonable under the circumstances 
items significantly impacted by estimates and judgments include  but are not limited to  representations  warranties and indemnities provided in connection with the spin off of daka international  inc in and the subsequent sale of the fuddruckers business unit in  self insured risks relating to workers compensation and general liability claims and legal liabilities  the useful lives and recoverability of our long lived assets such as property  equipment and intangibles  fair value attributed to assets and liabilities of acquired businesses  valuation of deferred tax assets and the recording of income tax expense 
loss contingencies and self insurance reserves we maintain accrued liabilities and reserves relating to the resolution of certain contingent obligations and reserves for self insurance 
significant contingencies include those related to litigation 
we account for contingent obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
which requires that we assess each contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
contingencies which are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  we accrue to the best estimate within that range  if none of the estimates within that range is better than another  we accrue to the low end of the range 
we are self insured for a significant portion of our employee health benefits  workers compensation and general liability programs 
however  we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our individual claim and total exposures under the programs 
we estimate our accrued liability for the ultimate costs to close known claims including claims incurred but not yet reported to us as of the balance sheet date 
our recorded estimated liability for self insurance is based on the insurance companies incurred loss estimates and management s judgment  including assumptions and factors related to the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history and our claims settlement practice 
the assessment of loss contingencies and self insurance reserves is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate settlement of loss contingencies and self insurance reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our financial statements 
useful lives of property and equipment land  buildings  leasehold improvements and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
these estimates may produce materially different amounts of reported depreciation and amortization expense if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact our need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and related identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
we separately evaluate each individual restaurant for impairment 
generally  a restaurant is not evaluated for impairment until it has been open a full six quarters as the initial two quarters of operations are generally characterized by operating inefficiencies associated with start up operations 
we consider four consecutive quarters of negative cash flow or losses to indicate a potential for an individual restaurant to be impaired 
we estimate the future cash flows for such potentially impaired restaurants utilizing such factors as restaurant sales trends  local economic conditions  demographics and competition  management plans and initiatives and other factors deemed appropriate in the circumstances 
as of june   we had two restaurants open for at least six quarters which had negative cash flow in the last fiscal year 
we currently have a plan to simplify these restaurants operations and thereby reduce costs which should significantly improve cash flow 
these initiatives are to be instituted in the first half of fiscal we believe it is premature to record an impairment on the long lived assets of these restaurants in light of our plans to improve the financial performance of these two restaurants 
additionally  we had another two restaurants open for at least six quarters which had positive cash flow over the last fiscal year  but the level of such cash flows were not high enough to sufficiently cover the restaurants long term asset values if such cash flows continue for the remainder of the restaurants lives 
these two restaurants had negative local factors occurring in the last year that impacted their operations 
we believe that the local factors will mitigate in the future and these restaurants cash flows will improve 
therefore  we believe recording an impairment is not appropriate at this time 
our forward looking judgments and estimates concerning the above mentioned restaurants may not materialize 
if such cash flows associated with any of these restaurants do not sufficiently improve  we would record an impairment for all or a portion of the respective restaurant s long lived assets depending on the fair value assigned to such assets 
as of june   the long lived assets value on these four restaurants totaled million 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill and other unidentifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we are required to assess impairment at least annually by means of a fair value based test 
at june   we evaluated our goodwill and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates related to our business and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimate 
leases we lease most of our properties including our corporate office 
we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for leases and subsequent amendments which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  we record the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and record the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments tenant improvement allowances received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
future authoritative changes to the methods of accounting for leases could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
valuation of deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying value for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities  resulting from a change in tax rates  is recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit in the period that such change occurs 
net operating loss and other credit carryforwards  including fica tip tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded for the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized based on projected future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences 
as of june   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
as a result of our improved profitability in recent years and our estimates of projected future taxable income  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize these net deferred tax assets 
as of june   we had federal net operating loss and fica tip credit carryforwards of approximately million  expiring at various dates through income tax provision certain components of our provision for income taxes are estimated 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for local and state taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns many months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed

the comparable alcohol sales decrease was due  in part  to a strategic de emphasis of the company s late night promotions as the promotions are costly and can alienate dinner guests 
sales in the january through march period were also negatively affected by severe weather primarily in ohio  indiana  the mid atlantic and colorado markets 
furthermore  sales were negatively affected by weakening consumer confidence and the impact of the war in iraq

restaurant level operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to for fiscal from for the comparable prior period 
the decrease was due to higher restaurant expenses as a percent of sales associated with the opening of seven new restaurants in fiscal the income generated from new restaurants is typically lower during the first four months of operation compared to an existing restaurant 
in addition  lower average restaurant sales resulted in fixed expenses being a higher percentage of revenues during fiscal reconciliation of restaurant level operating profit to the most comparable gaap measure  income from operations  is contained in footnote to the table under management s discussion and analysis results of operations on page and general and administrative expense

pre opening expense has historically been approximately million per location

provision for income tax benefit expense 
for fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of million compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the income tax benefit in fiscal was primarily the result of a reversal of the remaining valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards 
the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted from a determination by management that the net operating loss carryforwards are not limited under tax law and the company s future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the carryforwards before expiration 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   our unrestricted cash balance was million and our restricted cash balance was million 
the restricted cash balance primarily serves as collateral for performance obligations 
our cash balance and working capital needs are generally low  as sales are made for cash or through credit cards that are quickly converted to cash  purchases of food and supplies and other operating expenses are generally paid within to days after receipt of invoices and labor costs are paid bi weekly 
the timing of our sales collections and vendor and labor payments are consistent with other companies engaged in the restaurant industry 
our net working capital decreased by million in fiscal primarily as a result of using excess cash to reduce debt balances 
for fiscal years  and  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the increased cash flow from operating activities was due largely to our improved profitability and  to a smaller extent  due to increased cash from working capital changes 
our operating cash flow is enhanced by our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits to offset our federal income tax liability 
at june   we had million of such carryforwards and credits available through to offset federal taxes 
we expect to fully utilize these carryforwards and credits in the next seven to ten years 
a significant portion  if not all  of our cash flow generated from operating activities in each of the last three fiscal years has been invested in capital expenditures  the majority of which was for the construction of new stores 
we opened seven new restaurants in both fiscal and fiscal and six new restaurants in fiscal the following table  in thousands  details our capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years along with funding provided from tenant improvement allowances 
tenant improvement allowances are reimbursements received from certain of our landlords for a portion of initial construction expenditures 
fiscal year ended june  june  june  new store construction    existing store remodel and refurbishment    corporate related capital expenditures purchase of equipment previously under operating lease  purchase of property and equipment    proceeds from tenant improvement allowances    total capital expenditures for fiscal year are anticipated to be approximately million  before tenant improvement allowances 
these expenditures will primarily be for the construction of six new restaurants expected to open in fiscal  construction for certain restaurants expected to open in early fiscal and for upgrades to existing restaurants 
we review our capital expenditures budget on a monthly basis and amounts are subject to change 
we are anticipating receiving cash for tenant improvement allowances of approximately million for fiscal in january   we entered into an agreement with aei fund management  inc aei for the development and sale leaseback of up to seven new restaurants with an additional funding commitment of million 
at june   we had completed the construction of three restaurants under this commitment located in houston  texas  cincinnati  ohio and orland park  illinois 
the agreement expires the earlier of november  or upon aei s acceptance or rejection of seven total restaurant sites 
the funding of this build to suit facility is subject to various pre closing conditions 
for additional information on our agreement with aei  please refer to the information provided under note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated by reference herein 
we supplemented our operating cash flows over the last three years through various financing arrangements 
in september  we entered into a million five year term loan facility with general electric capital 
this facility was collateralized by equipment 
we borrowed million of the funds in fiscal and the million balance during the first quarter of fiscal these loans were repaid in fiscal in fiscal  we received million of gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes notes and warrants 
approximately million of issuance costs were incurred relative to the notes 
the notes are due december and require interest only payments semi annually 
also in fiscal  we received approximately million from the exercise of stock options 
most of the stock option exercises occurred as a result of a b stock trading plan under which our chief executive officer exercised million stock options before the options expired at the end of fiscal the exercise price of the options and certain tax withholding liabilities were paid through tendering almost half of the exercised shares with a fair value of million 
in fiscal  we entered into two term loans totaling million with general electric capital collateralized by equipment 
as of june   we had approximately million outstanding under these term loans 
these loans bear interest at the day commercial paper rate  plus and mature between december and february also in fiscal  we received million of proceeds from equipment capital lease transactions 
in fiscal and fiscal  we elected to prepay million and million  respectively  of our existing debt to reduce our annual interest costs 
the funds to prepay the debt came from excess cash  the million issuance of convertible notes in fiscal and borrowings under the new million senior secured bank credit facility obtained in fiscal prepayment penalties and a write off of unamortized deferred financing fees totaling  and  were recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a result of prepaying the debt before its scheduled maturity 
in march  we obtained a three year million senior secured credit facility with a new lender  lasalle bank 
we used a portion of the facility to refinance certain of our existing debt and the facility may also be used to support growth and general working capital needs and provide up to million for the issuance of letters of credit 
the facility is secured by a blanket lien on all personal assets and real property of the company 
borrowings under the facility will bear interest depending on a total funded debt to ebitda ratio and will range from prime to prime plus basis points or  if elected  libor plus to basis points 
we paid an up front fee of  and are required to pay an annual unused commitment fee of basis points to basis points 
outstanding borrowings under the facility may be converted to a five year term loan if the ratio of senior debt to ebitda exceeds specified levels 
the facility requires the company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and tangible net worth level and not exceed thresholds for total funded debt to ebitda and total senior debt to ebitda ratios 
capitalized terms refer to defined terms in the senior secured credit facility 
the facility limits the opening of new restaurants to a maximum of twenty four over a three year period and also limits the amount of dividends and or stock repurchases 
as of june   the company had million of outstanding borrowings under this facility and had placed letters of credit of million under the facility with million available for additional borrowing 
as of june   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and financial ratios 
at june   we had a bank credit facility with first national bank of colorado under which we could borrow up to million to provide short term working capital and to support the issuance of letters of credit 
as of june   we had no outstanding borrowings but had placed letters of credit of million under this working capital facility 
the company has no intent to extend this facility past its january expiration in light of its new million credit facility 
for additional information regarding our material debt instruments  including our million convertible subordinated notes and related warrants  million senior secured credit facility with lasalle bank  and our million bank credit facility with first national bank of colorado  please refer to the information provided under note long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated by reference herein 
there will be cash payments during the next twelve months associated with predecessor company activities 
such cash payments will include settlements and on going legal costs 
we expect the total cash payments for these liabilities to be approximately million  but the amounts could be higher depending on the final outcome of litigation 

for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies  including our payments associated with our predecessor company activities  please refer to the information provided under note commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated by reference herein 
during fiscal  and  we expended approximately million  million and million related to the predecessor company matters 
we believe our cash flow from operations  together with anticipated tenant improvement allowances of approximately million and funds available under our million credit facility million available at june  will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt repayment and expansion at least through the end of fiscal however  changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events  including those described in item business risk factors  may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing on an accelerated basis 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants and or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate and grow our business 
contractual obligations and commitments payments  including interest  due by period as of june  in s contractual obligations total one year and less two to three years four to five years after five years operating leases      long term debt     letters of credit   construction commitments   build to suit construction commitments we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for our headquarters and all but one of our restaurants 
the fixed terms of the restaurant leases range up to years and generally contain multiple renewal options for various periods ranging from five to years 
our restaurant leases also contain provisions that require additional rent payments based on sales performance and the payment of common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes 
amounts in this table do not reflect any of these additional amounts 
our long term debt is principally comprised of a million issuance of convertible notes due december  unless otherwise earlier converted into our common stock 
additionally  at june   we had term debt balances of million and million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the credit facility borrowings mature in march we have letters of credit outstanding to guarantee performance under insurance contracts and to secure other arrangements 
the letters of credit are irrevocable and have one year renewable terms 
we have commitments under contracts for the purchase of property and equipment and for the construction of buildings under build to suit arrangements or otherwise 
portions of such contracts not completed at june  as stated above were not reflected as assets or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  alcoholic beverages and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant associates are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay property taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot predict whether inflation will have an impact on our results of operations in the future 
seansonality our sales fluctuate seasonally and therefore our quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
for fiscal years and  our relative sales were highest in our second quarter october through december  followed by our third quarter january through march  then by our fourth quarter april through june 
our first quarter july through september recorded the lowest relative sales for those years 
factors influencing sales variability in addition to those noted above include the frequency and popularity of sporting events  holidays including which day of the week the holiday occurs and weather 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
at june   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on approximately million of notes payable and bank credit facility borrowings carrying variable interest rates 
a hypothetical one hundred basis point increase in interest rates for these notes payable would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  we have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short term invested cash and cash equivalents 
the principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value because of their highly liquid short term nature 
as of june   we had no such funds invested in short term maturing investments 
many of the ingredients purchased for use in the products sold to our guests are subject to unpredictable price volatility outside of our control 
we try to manage this risk by entering into selective short term agreements for the products we use most extensively 
also  we believe that our commodity cost risk is diversified as many of our food products are available from several sources and we have the ability to modify product recipes or vary our menu items offered 
historically  we have also been able to increase certain menu prices in response to food commodity price increases and believe the opportunity may exist in the future 
to compensate for a hypothetical price increase of for food and beverages  we would need to increase prices charged to our guests by an average of approximately 
we have not used financial instruments to hedge our commodity product prices
