overview business  principal products  and locations we are a leading provider of human capital development and management solutions  which are designed to increase organizational performance through the implementation of a management system for aligning  developing and managing people 
our solutions can help large enterprises efficiently manage regulatory compliance  increase sales and channel readiness  accelerate time to competency of people across the extended enterprise  increase speed of customer acquisition  shorten time to market of new products and increase visibility into organizational performance 
we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we shipped our first saba enterprise learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april in august  we shipped our generally available version of saba enterprise performance 
our corporate headquarters are located in redwood shores  california 
in addition  we have seven non us subsidiaries through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  india  france  japan  germany  the united kingdom  canada and australia  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities 
in the case of our india subsidiary  our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities 
revenue models we generate the majority of our revenues from the sale of perpetual software licenses  primarily saba enterprise learning  along with annual support services that are generally purchased concurrently with the license and renewed annually thereafter 
we also derive revenues from performing services  including providing implementation  consulting  hosting and education services related to our software products 
we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
as of may   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we also expect to incur non cash expenses relating to amortization of purchased intangible assets and any potential goodwill impairment 
we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will be able to realize sufficient revenues to achieve or  if achieved  sustain profitability 
significant trends and developments in our business worldwide demand for enterprise wide software applications has decreased over the last two years 
the global economic slowdown has resulted in many organizations reducing their information technology budgets and related expenditures on enterprise software 
this has not only limited sales of licenses to new and existing customers but has also resulted in longer customer evaluations and decision making processes 
we believe these macroeconomic trends have had an effect on our revenues 
the decline in revenues for our fiscal year ended may  was partially offset by increases in support services revenue due to a high level of renewals across a larger customer base 
despite the decline in revenues  our restructuring activities over the past several years and our management of operating expenses have allowed us to decrease our net loss 
we continue to focus on aggressively managing costs to achieve positive cash flow from operations while investing in areas we deem appropriate  such as the recent expansion of our north american sales organization 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our costs to generate positive cash flow from operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs 
we have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of these fees is probable 
sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to support and consulting services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
license revenues from end users are generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and we generally recognize revenue from resellers when an end user has been identified and the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
revenues from our application service provider offering and from our hosting services are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the support term  typically months  and revenue related to implementation  consulting  education  and other services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we primarily provide implementation and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method 
we use labor hours incurred as a percentage of total expected hours as the measure of progress towards completion 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million as of may  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled  as of may   is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the 
table of contents accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
effective june   we adopted sfas no 
as such  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of may  in addition  we evaluated our purchased intangible assets and determined that all such assets have determinable lives 
total amortization of goodwill prior to june  was million and our remaining goodwill balance at may  was million 
amortization of purchased intangible assets  including acquired developed technology  was  for fiscal and million for our remaining purchased intangible assets balance was  as of may  sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually  or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
any reduction of enterprise fair value below the recorded amount of stockholders equity could require us to write down the value of goodwill to its fair value and record an expense for the impairment loss 
restructuring costs 
the total accrued restructuring balance as of may  was  which was comprised of  for facilities related charges and  for workforce reduction charges 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas where we have vacant space and necessarily entail a high level of management judgment 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined

in fiscal  one customer accounted for of our revenues 
license revenue 
license revenue decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal and during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in license revenue during fiscal compared to 
table of contents fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenues in the united states 
the decrease in license revenue in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a greater amount of deferred license revenues recognized in fiscal that were attributable to software licenses sold in prior periods 
revenues from new license sales made in fiscal were essentially flat in comparison to revenues from new license sales made in fiscal services revenue 
services revenue decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal and during fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases in services revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal and during fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily attributable to decreases in consulting revenue  which were partially offset by increases in support revenue 
the decline in consulting revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in the number of active projects caused primarily by an increase in the number of implementations performed by third party systems integrators 
the increase in the use of third party systems integrators was partially due to an increase in the mix of international customers where third party resellers and systems integrators are more frequently utilized 
the decline in consulting revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a reduction in the average project size resulting from implementation efficiencies 
the mix of license and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues has varied significantly primarily due to variability in new license sales

our cost of license revenue includes the cost of manuals and product documentation  production media  shipping costs and royalties to third parties 
the changes in the cost of license revenue during fiscal years  and were primarily attributable to variability in the amount of royalties paid to third parties 
cost of services revenue 
our cost of services revenue includes salaries and related expenses for our professional services and support organizations  as well as third party subcontractors and hosting costs  and billed expenses 
the decreases in cost of services revenue in both fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily attributable to a reduction in consulting personnel in response to a decline in consulting services revenue 
cost of services revenue represented of services revenue for fiscal  of services revenue for fiscal and services revenue for fiscal the increase in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower consultant utilization rates and lower realized average hourly billing rates for consultants  partially offset by an increased percentage of higher margin support revenues as a percentage of total services revenue 
the decrease in the cost of services as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher consultant utilization rates  as well as an increased percentage of higher margin support revenues as a percentage of total services revenue 

table of contents amortization of acquired developed technology 
our cost of services revenue includes amortization of acquired developed technology resulting from our june acquisition of ultris inc we expect that the unamortized balance of  will be amortized by the end of the first quarter of fiscal because our cost of services revenue is greater than our cost of license revenue  cost of total revenues as a percentage of total revenues will fluctuate based on the mix of licenses and services sold 
operating expenses we classify all operating expenses  except amortization of stock compensation charges  amortization of purchased intangible assets and settlement of litigation  to the research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate these expenses to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such expenses based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts and administrative and professional services fees

research and development expense decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal and during fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases were primarily attributable to decreases in research and development personnel in the us  partially offset by increased staffing in our lower cost development center in india 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was also partially attributable to a decrease in the use of third party consultants 
we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal and during fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases were primarily attributable to reduced sales and marketing personnel  lower commission expense due to a decline in revenues and lower expenditures for marketing programs 
despite these decreases  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal due to higher commissions and the costs associated with expanding our north american sales organization 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal and during fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases in both fiscal 
table of contents compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily attributable to lower general and administrative headcount 
additionally  the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially attributable to a decrease in legal fees primarily attributable to the patent infringement action that was settled in september we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future 
amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock compensation charges 
during fiscal we amortized the remaining deferred stock compensation of  we do not expect to incur future deferred stock compensation charges unless we issue stock options that must be accounted for using a fair value method 
included in the charges for fiscal is  for compensation expense resulting from the acceleration of vesting of common stock for certain terminated employees 
this charge was partially offset by a reduction in amortization of deferred stock compensation of  that resulted from the cancellation of unvested stock options as a result of employee attrition and reductions in workforce 
also included in fiscal is compensation expense of  related to the acceleration of amortization of deferred stock compensation for options that were cancelled in accordance with our voluntary stock option exchange program 
the exchange program is not expected to result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
included in amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges in fiscal is million related to the post acquisition amortization of the deferred stock compensation for the intrinsic value of common stock subject to repurchase assumed in connection with the acquisition of ultris inc the estimated intrinsic value of the  shares subject to repurchase was approximately million 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the noncompetition agreements that resulted from our march acquisition of human performance technologies  inc decreased for the periods presented as we amortized the final  during fiscal settlement of litigation 
in september  we reached an agreement regarding the settlement of pending patent litigation and recorded a charge of million 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we were required to pay million over nine months 
the remaining balance of  at may  was paid in full during june in addition  we issued approximately  shares of our common stock valued as of the settlement date at  restructuring charges during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
the restructurings programs during fiscal were implemented under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  while the restructuring programs during fiscal and fiscal were implemented under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the restructuring programs included worldwide workforce reductions across all functions and consolidation of excess facilities 
workforce reduction charges consist primarily of severance and fringe benefits 
the restructuring charges are classified in the statement of operations as follows years ended may  in thousands cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative 
table of contents during fiscal we recorded net restructuring charges of  these charges were comprised of  for an excess facility that arose after default by a subtenant and  from the consolidation of an excess facility 
these charges were partially offset by a  decrease to a workforce reduction accrual made in a prior period that resulted from severance payments that were less than previous estimates 
the excess facilities charges were based on the present value of the sum of non cancelable lease costs  less estimates for future sublease income  which will be paid over the estimated vacancy periods through fiscal during fiscal  saba recognized accretion expense of  due to the passage of time in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of these restructurings  we estimate that we will not recognize net lease expenses of approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal there will not be any future cash savings from these restructurings 
during fiscal  we recorded workforce reduction charges of million and facilities related charges of  a substantial majority of the workforce reduction charges  which resulted from the reduction of employees across all business functions and geographic regions  were paid by the end of fiscal and the remaining balance is expected to be paid by the end of fiscal the annual cost of these employees was approximately million 
the facilities related charges related to non cancelable lease costs were paid over the estimated vacancy period which ended in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded workforce reduction charges of million and facilities related charges of million 
the workforce reduction charges  which resulted from the reduction of employees across all business functions and geographic regions  were paid by the end of fiscal the facilities related charges relate to non cancelable lease costs that will be paid over the estimated vacancy period through fiscal our estimated costs to exit these facilities are based on available commercial rates 
the actual loss incurred in exiting these facilities could be different from our estimates 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net consists of interest income  and other non operating expenses 
interest income and other  net was a loss of  in fiscal  income of  in fiscal and income of  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to foreign exchange losses of  resulting from unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables compared to a gain of  in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable a charge for an other than temporary decline in the value of an investment in fiscal of interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to savings realized from our buyout of approximately million of capital leases in fiscal the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to payments on prior capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes from inception to may   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes 
we recorded income tax expense of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the income tax expense consists entirely of foreign income tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended may  this information has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year or any other period 
three months ended aug  nov  feb  may  aug  nov  feb  may  in thousands  except per share data revenues license services total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets settlement of litigation total operating expenses loss from operations interest income expense and other  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss basic and diluted net loss per share our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenues fall below our expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to predict revenues between quarters 
we are subject to employer payroll taxes  both domestic and foreign  on employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
these taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees  measured by the difference between the price of our 
table of contents common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
we receive domestic tax deductions for gains realized by domestic employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital when realized 
our taxes and cash flows could vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of non qualified stock options exercised by employees in any quarter and  consequently  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include those described below and under the caption factors that may affect future operating results dependence of our revenues on a small number of large orders and the average order value  our ability to attract new customers  any changes in revenue recognition rules and interpretations of these rules  our ability to license additional products to current customers  the announcement or introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in the pricing of our products and services or those of our competitors  variability in the mix of our products and services revenues in any quarter  technical difficulties or service interruptions of our computer network systems or the internet generally  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion or contraction of our business  and foreign currency fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources as of may   our principal source of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of  at may  our bank facility covenants required us to maintain cash  net of borrowings of million 
year ended may  may  may  dollars in thousands cash used in operating activities cash provided by investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash used in operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is from our customers upon the purchase of license and support services  support renewals and consulting services 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel and facilities related expenditures 
cash used in operating activities decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to a lower net loss  which was partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily attributable to a net loss of million  which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  and depreciation and amortization of million 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily attributable to a net loss of million  which was partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  and amortization of acquired developed technology of million 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily attributable to a net loss of million  which was partially offset by amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of goodwill of million and a charge for acquired in process research and development of million 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from redemptions and maturities of short term investments of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to reduced proceeds from net redemptions and maturities as a result of fewer short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock  which  during fiscal  reflects million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a private placement 
this decrease was partially offset by net borrowings under our credit facility of million during fiscal cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of stock under our stock incentive programs of million  partially offset by million of payments of principal on capital lease obligations 
contractual obligations as of may   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenses 
our principal commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases and our credit facility 
the credit facility was last amended in august the credit facility  as in effect at may  and prior to the august amendment  provided for an equipment term loan of up to million equipment line  a separate term loan of million term loan  and a revolving line of credit revolving line that allowed saba to borrow up to million 
in may  saba borrowed million against the revolving line  which was repaid in june saba made borrowings totaling  during fiscal and  during fiscal under the equipment line  which must be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest 
term loans with principal of  at may   and  at may  were outstanding under the equipment line that bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to and maturities from august to may saba had outstanding under the term loan principal in the amount of  at may  and million at may  the term loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to the banks prime rate plus and matures in march under the credit facility  we had to satisfy certain covenants  including a financial covenant  to maintain a balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  net of borrowings  of million at each fiscal quarter end and million on any date that was not a fiscal quarter end 
as of may   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
the credit facility also restricted our ability to pay cash dividends 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at may  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
of the million in operating leases  net of sublease income   has been included in accrued restructuring charges as of may  sublease income included in the table below amounted to  for fiscal and  for fiscal total operating leases capital leases debt obligations patent settlement in thousands fiscal year ending may  thereafter 
table of contents we currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit facility  combined with cash flows generated from revenues  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital  capital expense and business expansion requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or could choose  to raise additional funds at any time 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
recent events in august  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with pequot private equity fund iii  lp and pequot offshore private equity partners iii  lp providing for the issuance of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
total estimated net proceeds from the private placement are million 
prior to the closing of the private placement  we received from nasdaq a letter indicating our non compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement necessary to remain eligible for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
as a result of the closing of the private placement  we believe that we comply with nasdaq s minimum stockholders equity requirement as of the date of this annual report 
as nasdaq does with all companies  it will continue to monitor us for ongoing compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement 
failure to demonstrate compliance with the minimum stockholder s equity requirement in our quarterly report for the three months ending august  could subject us to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
in august  we amended our credit facility to provide for a million non formula based revolving line of credit and an equipment term loan of up to  under the revolving line of credit and equipment term loan  we may make draws through august interest on borrowings under the revolving line of credit must be repaid monthly and outstanding principal must be repaid in august borrowings under the equipment term loan must be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest 
outstanding principal under the revolving line of credit bears interest at a rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus per annum and outstanding principal under equipment term loan bears interest at either a fluctuating rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus or a fixed rate equal to the month us treasury note plus 
other terms of the credit facility  including terms applicable to the existing term loans with outstanding principal of  at may   remained unchanged 
this amended credit facility requires us to satisfy certain covenants including a financial covenant to maintain a minimum balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  net of borrowings  of million on deposit with the bank at all times 
the credit facility also restricts our ability to pay cash dividends 
factors that may impact future operating results we have a history of losses  expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability 
we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability 
we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future from the licensing of saba enterprise learning and providing related services 
over the longer term  we expect to derive revenues from new products such as saba enterprise performance and related services 
in the future  we expect to continue to incur non cash expenses relating to the amortization of purchased intangible assets that will contribute to our net losses  along with any potential goodwill impairment 
as of may   we had  of purchased intangible assets to be amortized and our remaining goodwill balance was million 
as a result of all of the foregoing  we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to achieve profitability 
if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain it 

table of contents fluctuations of our results could cause our stock price to experience significant fluctuations or declines 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly in the future 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future revenues and operating results as a result of many factors  including difficulty predicting the size and timing of customer orders  on going difficult economic conditions  particularly within the technology industry  as well as economic uncertainties arising out of possible future terrorist activities  military and security actions in iraq and the middle east in general  and geopolitical instability  all of which have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce the size of orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could have an adverse impact on our international revenue  changes in our competitors product offerings and pricing policies  and customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements from us or our competitors  the performance of our international business  which accounts for a substantial part of our consolidated revenues  any increased price sensitivity by our customers  particularly in the face of the continuing uneven economic conditions and increased competition  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products  such as our saba enterprise performance product  on a timely basis and whether any such new products are accepted in the market  the lengthy sales cycle for our products  our ability to further control costs and expenses  particularly in the face of the on going current difficult economic conditions  loss of key personnel  the structure  timing and integration of acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  the terms and timing of financing activities  potential fluctuations in demand or prices of our products and services  technological changes in computer systems and environments  our ability to meet our customers service requirements  and costs associated with acquisitions  including expenses charged for any impaired acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicators of future performance 
our operating expenses are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
during fiscal and fiscal we took actions to reduce our operating expenses and  while we may from time to time reduce operating expenses in response to variability in our revenues  including variabilities caused by downturns in the united states and or international economies  over the long term we generally expect to increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing operations  fund greater levels of research and development  develop new alliances  increase our services and support capabilities and improve our operational and financial systems 
if our revenues do not increase along with these expenses  our business would be seriously harmed and net losses in a given quarter would be even larger than expected 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenues are especially subject to fluctuations because they depend on the sale of a small number of relatively large orders  principally orders for saba enterprise learning and related services 
as a 
table of contents result  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate if we are unable to complete a sufficient number of large orders in any particular quarter 
furthermore  our quarterly revenues may be affected significantly by changes in revenue recognition policies and procedures based on changes to  or new  applicable accounting standards and how these standards are interpreted 
our lengthy sales cycle could cause delays in revenue growth 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products and services is often long 
a customer s decision to purchase our products and services requires the commitment to increase performance through human capital development and management  involves a significant allocation of resources  and is influenced by a customer s budgetary cycles 
to successfully sell our products and services  we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products and services  which can require significant time and resources 
many of our potential customers are large enterprises that generally take longer to make significant business decisions 
our typical sales cycle has been approximately to months 
the delay or failure to complete sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large orders  it would adversely affect the timing of our revenues 
if we were to experience a delay on a large order  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given quarter 
a decline in the price of  or demand for  our main product  saba enterprise learning or our related services offerings would seriously harm our revenues and operating margins 
to date  saba enterprise learning and related services have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenues 
we anticipate that revenues from saba enterprise learning and related services will continue to constitute a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
consequently  a decline in the price of  or demand for  saba enterprise learning or failure to achieve broad market acceptance would seriously harm our business 
we are exposed to recent unfavorable economic conditions 
we have seen a rapid and increasingly severe downturn in the united states economy since the first quarter of fiscal ended august   which has been further stalled by terrorist attacks in september and the war in iraq in early there can be no certainty as to the severity or duration of this downturn 
although we cannot predict the extent and timing  if any  of the impact of economic downturns in the united states on economies in other countries or geographic regions  we have also seen an economic slowdown in certain international markets in which we conduct business 
if the economic conditions in the united states continue or worsen or if a global economic slowdown intensifies  the demand for our products and services may be reduced 
not only may these economic slowdowns reduce our customers and prospects budgets for our products and services  but also they may adversely affect our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
accordingly  these economic slowdowns may have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our performance depends on a new market human capital development and management 
the market for software solutions that automate human capital development and management is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
substantially all of our revenues are attributable to the suite of products and services in this market 
if this market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  or if we fail to identify the challenges and risks in this new market or successfully address these risks  our business would be harmed 
changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue 
while we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  the american institute of certified public accountants continues to issue implementation guidelines 
table of contents for these standards and the accounting profession continues to discuss a wide range of potential interpretations 
additional implementation guidelines  and changes in interpretations of such guidelines  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices that could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue to future periods or to recognize lower revenue 
in addition  there has been an ongoing public debate whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plan shares should be measured at their fair value and treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we were to elect or were required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we could have significant compensation charges 
for example  for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb statement no 
 diluted loss per share would have been increased by   and per share  respectively 
although we are currently not required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock based compensation as a compensation expense using the fair value method 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives 
we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management personnel 
these employees are not subject to employment contracts 
we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining our key employees in the future 
our future success and our ability to expand our operations will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified technical  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals and the high demand for them  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain personnel  particularly technical  sales and marketing personnel  would have a material adverse effect on our business and potential growth 
additionally  volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our brand and operating results could be harmed 
we may discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
difficulties we may encounter managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations 
we intend to grow our business significantly 
to support our growth plans  we may need to expand our existing management  operational  financial and human resources  customer service and management information systems and controls 
we may be unable to expand these systems and to manage our planned growth successfully  and this inability would adversely affect our business 

table of contents intense competition in our target market could impair our ability to grow and to achieve profitability 
the market for our products and services is intensely competitive  dynamic and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of the competition and the pace of change are expected to increase in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we encounter competition with respect to different aspects of our solution from a variety of sources including companies that market and license training  learning  performance  content  resource  talent and staffing management systems  enterprise software vendors that offer human resources information systems and employee relationship management systems with training and performance modules  potential customers internal development efforts  companies that operate internet based marketplaces for the sale of on line learning  companies that operate internet based marketplaces for the sale of goods and services and could potentially decide to evolve their marketplaces to include content offerings  and internet portals that offer learning content  performance support tools or recruiting services 
we expect competition from a variety of established and emerging companies 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other partners  thereby increasing the availability of their services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  and competitive pressures that we encounter may seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to manage the complexity of conducting business globally  our international revenues may suffer 
international revenues accounted for of our revenues for our fiscal year ended may  and for our fiscal years ended may  and we intend to expand our international presence in the future 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to certain risks  including changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  language barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  potentially harmful tax consequences  fluctuating exchange rates  price controls and other restrictions on foreign currency  difficulties in obtaining import and export licenses  
table of contents political and social unrest or disturbances  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and political or economic constraints on international trade 
we might not successfully market  sell or distribute our products and services in foreign markets  and we cannot be certain that one or more of the factors indicated above will not materially adversely affect our future international operations  and consequently  our business and future growth 
our business is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws that could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business  thereby adversely affecting our financial results 
the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  and other intellectual property issues  encryption  taxation  libel  export or import matters and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
for example  the interpretation and application of data protection laws in europe and elsewhere are still uncertain and in flux 
it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices 
if so  in addition to the possibility of fines  this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices  which in turn could have a material effect on our business 
existing or new legislation could expose us to substantial liability  restrict our ability to deliver our software or services  limit our ability to grow and cause us to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and  to compete  we must continually enhance our products and services 
we must continue to enhance and improve the performance  functionality and reliability of our products and services 
the software and electronic commerce industries are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and services introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our products and services obsolete 
in the past  we have discovered that some of our customers desire additional performance and functionality not currently offered by our products 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to both internally develop and license leading technologies to enhance our existing products and services  develop new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the development of our technology and other proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks 
we may fail to use new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  customer requirements or emerging industry standards  we may not be able to increase our revenues and expand our business 
delays in releasing new products or enhanced versions of our existing products could adversely affect our competitive position 
as part of our strategy  we expect to regularly release new products and new versions of our existing products 
even if our new products or new versions of our existing products contain the features and functionality our customers want  in the event we are unable to timely introduce these new products or product releases  our competitive position may be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the development of currently planned or future products or product releases in a timely and efficient manner 
due to the complexity of our products  internal quality assurance testing and customer testing of pre commercial releases may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of these products 
in addition  the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement would likely cause delays in the development and release of other future products or enhancements to our currently available products 
any delay in releasing future products or enhancements of our products could harm our business 

table of contents if we release products containing defects  we may need to halt further shipments and our business and reputation would be harmed 
products as complex as ours often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial shipment of new products or enhancements to existing products 
although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before shipment to them  our products are not error free 
these errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or delays in customer acceptance and would be detrimental to our business and reputation 
as is typical in the software industry  with each release we have discovered errors in our products after introduction 
we will not be able to detect and correct all errors before releasing our products commercially and these undetected errors could be significant 
we cannot assure you that undetected errors or performance problems in our existing or future products will not be discovered in the future or that known errors considered minor by us will not be considered serious by our customers  resulting in a decrease in our revenues 
claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights  particularly in the software and internet related industries 
we could become subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings 
any of these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend and could divert management s attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop noninfringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology  and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
in addition  we have three patents issued in the united states and four patent applications pending in the united states 
we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued for any of the pending patent applications 
even for the issued patents  or any patent issued to us in the future  there can be no assurance that such patent will protect our intellectual property  or will not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
our disaster recovery plan does not include redundant systems  and a disaster could severely damage our operations 
our disaster recovery plan does not include fully redundant systems for our services at an alternate site 
a disaster could severely harm our business because our services could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect the computer systems needed for the day to day operation of saba learning asp edition and our hosting services 
a number of these computer systems are located on or near known earthquake fault zones 
although these systems are designed to be fault tolerant  they are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and other events 
additionally  we do not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate us for all potential losses that could occur 

table of contents we outsource the management and maintenance of our hosted and asp solutions to third parties and will depend upon them to provide adequate management and maintenance services 
we rely on third parties to provide key components of our networks and systems 
for instance  we rely on third party internet service providers to host our products for customers who desire to have these solutions hosted 
we also rely on third party communications service providers for the high speed connections that link our and our internet service providers web servers and office systems to the internet 
any internet or communications systems failure or interruption could result in disruption of our service or loss or compromise of customer orders and data 
these failures  especially if they are prolonged or repeated  would make our services less attractive to customers and tarnish our reputation 
we depend upon continuing our relationship with third party integrators who support our solutions 
our success depends upon the acceptance and successful integration by customers of our products 
we often rely on third party systems integrators to assist with implementation of our products 
we will need to continue to rely on these systems integrators even as we increase the size of our professional services group 
if large systems integrators fail to continue to support our solution or commit resources to us  if any of our customers are not able to successfully integrate our solution or if we are unable to adequately train our existing systems integration partners  our business  operating results and financial condition could suffer 
in addition  we have only limited control over the level and quality of service provided by our current and future third party integrators 
we may not be able to secure necessary funding in the future  additional funding may result in dilution to our stockholders 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
we have had significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect to use our available cash resources and credit facilities primarily to fund sales and marketing activities  research and development  and continued operations  and possibly make future acquisitions 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if our capital requirements increase materially from those currently planned or if revenues fail to materialize  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
in addition  in order for our common stock to continue to be quoted on the nasdaq national market  we must satisfy various financial requirements established by nasdaq 
as a result of the closing of a private placement in august  we believe that we comply with nasdaq s minimum stockholders equity requirement as of the date of this annual report 
as nasdaq does with all companies  it will continue to monitor us for ongoing compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement 
failure to demonstrate compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement or other requirements could subject us to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
our past and future acquisitions may result in disruptions to our business if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses 
in march  we acquired human performance technologies  inc and  in june  we acquired ultris inc as part of our overall business strategy  we expect to continue to acquire complementary businesses or technologies that will provide additional products or services offerings  additional industry expertise or an expanded geographic presence 
these acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  or the incurrence of debt 
in addition  any acquisition may 
table of contents increase the risk of future write offs for acquired in process research and development  write offs for the impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  or amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and our operating results 
for example  as of february   our remaining goodwill balance was million 
although these two acquisitions are fully integrated  future acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including those described above and the following the announcement of new products and services or product and service enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts that may follow our stock  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
broad market and industry trends may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
sales of shares eligible for future sale could cause our stock price to decline 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
the anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquiror were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquiror would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms that make it difficult to remove all directors at once 
the acquiror would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to remove directors at an annual 
table of contents meeting 
the acquiror will not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which will require the acquiror to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
our board of directors also has the ability to issue preferred stock that would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquiror that it did not feel was in our strategic interests 
if the acquiror was discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by our anti takeover measures  you could lose the opportunity to sell your shares at a favorable price 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in may  we borrowed million against the line of credit  which was repaid in june therefore  only future borrowings would be affected by changes in the market interest rates 
the revolving line of credit portion of our credit facility  as amended in august  allows us to make draws at a variable interest rate using the bank s prime rate plus 
at may   we had outstanding equipment term loans of  that bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
the equipment term loan portion of our credit facility allows us to make draws at a either a fluctuating rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus or a fixed rate equal to the month us treasury note plus 
therefore  only future borrowings on the equipment term loan portion of our credit facility would be affected by changes in market interest rates 
at may   we also had an outstanding term loan of  that bears interest at a variable rate based on the bank s prime rate plus 
if the bank s prime rate were to change by from its level at may   the impact would not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
in order to borrow against the credit facility  as amended in august  we must satisfy certain covenants including a financial covenant to maintain a minimum balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  net of borrowings  of million on deposit with the bank at all times 
as of may   we were in compliance with the then applicable covenants 
the credit facility also restricts our ability to pay cash dividends 
foreign currency risk we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  and to a lesser but increasing extent  british pounds and euros  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and japanese yen 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from the translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact operating results
