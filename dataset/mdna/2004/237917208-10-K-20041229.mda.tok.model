critical accounting policies in the preparation of financial statements and other financial data  management applies certain accounting policies to transactions that  depending on choices made by management  can result in various outcomes 
in order for a reader to understand the following information regarding the financial performance and condition of the company  an understanding of those accounting policies is important 
the company s accounting policies are set forth in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in item certain of those policies are comparatively more important to the company s financial results and condition than others 
the policies that the company believes are most important for a reader s understanding of the financial information are described below 
revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns reserve the company has two types of software product offerings enterprise software and desktop and server software 
enterprise software products are generally sold directly to end users 
the company sells its desktop and server software products directly to end users and through distributors and resellers 
sales to distributors and resellers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total sales for the fiscal years ended september   and revenue from the sale of all software products is generally recognized at the time of shipment  provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is considered probable  persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and there are no significant obligations remaining 
both types of the company s software product offerings are off the shelf as such term is defined by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
the company s products are relatively straightforward and the software can be installed and used by customers on their own with little or no customization required 
multi user licenses marketed by the company are sold as a right to use the number of licenses and license fee revenue is recognized upon delivery of all software required to satisfy the number of licenses sold 
upon delivery  the licensing fee is payable without further delivery obligations of the company 
desktop and server software products are generally not sold in multiple element arrangements 
accordingly  the price paid by the customer is considered the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for those products 
enterprise software sales are generally multiple element arrangements which include software license deliverables  professional services and post contract customer support 
in such multiple element arrangements  the company applies the residual method in determining revenue to be allocated to a software license 
in applying the residual method  the company deducts from the sale proceeds the vsoe of fair value of the services and post contract customer support in determining the residual fair value of the software license 
the vsoe of fair value of the services and post contract customer support is based on the amounts charged for these elements when sold separately 
professional services include implementation  integration  training and consulting services with revenue recognized as the services are performed 
these services are generally delivered on a time and materials basis  are billed on a current basis as the work is performed  and do not involve modification or customization of the software or any other unusual acceptance clauses or terms 
post contract customer support is typically provided under a maintenance agreement which provides technical support and rights to unspecified software maintenance updates and bug fixes on a when and if available basis 
revenue from post contract customer support services is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period generally one year 
such deferred amounts are recorded as part of deferred revenue in the company s consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere herein 
the company also sells its enterprise software using a subscription model 
at the time a customer enters into a binding agreement to purchase a subscription  the customer is invoiced for an initial term of the subscription generally ninety days and an account receivable and deferred revenue are recorded 
beginning on the date the software is installed at the customer site and available for use by the customer  the deferred revenue amount is recognized ratably over the initial term of the agreement provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
following the initial term  the customer is invoiced for each subsequent term generally ninety days  once again resulting in an account receivable and deferred revenue being recorded 
the deferred revenue is then recognized ratably over such subsequent term 
the company s software products are sold under warranty against certain defects in material and workmanship for a period of to days from the date of purchase 
certain software products  including desktop versions of monarch  monarch data pump  and vortexml sold directly to end users  include a guarantee under which such customers may return products within to days for a full refund 
additionally  the company provides its distributors with stock balancing rights and applies the guidance found in sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenue from the sale of software products to distributors and resellers is recognized at the time of shipment providing all other criteria for revenue recognition as stated above are met and i the distributor or reseller is unconditionally obligated to pay for the products  including no contingency as to product resale  ii the distributor or reseller has independent economic substance apart from the company  iii the company is not obligated for future performance to bring about product resale  and iv the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
the company s experience and history with its distributors and resellers allows for reasonable estimates of future returns 
among other things  estimates of potential future returns are made based on the inventory levels at the various distributors and resellers  which the company monitors frequently 
once the estimates of potential future returns from all sources are made  the company determines if it has adequate returns reserves to cover anticipated returns and the returns reserve is adjusted as required 
adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenue in the period of adjustment 
actual returns have historically been within the range estimated by the company 
for the fiscal years ended september   and changes to and ending balances of the returns reserve were approximately as follows returns reserve balance beginning of year    amounts accrued for the returns reserve    returns applied against the returns reserve    returns reserve balance end of year    the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts receivable  the company records an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  changes to and ending balances of the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately as follows allowance for doubtful accounts balance beginning of year    additions to the allowance of doubtful accounts    amounts applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts    allowance for doubtful accounts balance end of year    capitalized software development costs the company capitalizes certain software development costs as well as purchased software upon achieving technological feasibility of the related products 
software development costs incurred and software purchased prior to achieving technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
commencing upon initial product release  capitalized costs are amortized to cost of software licenses and subscriptions using the straight line method over the estimated life which approximates the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  generally to months 
for the fiscal years ended september   and amounts related to capitalized software development costs and purchased software were approximately as follows capitalized software balance beginning of year    capitalized software development costs    capitalized purchased software   amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased software    capitalized software balance end of year    foreign currency translations assets and liabilities of the company s foreign subsidiaries  which are principally located in the uk and australia  are translated into us dollars at rates in effect at each balance sheet date 
revenues  expenses and cash flows are translated into us dollars at average rates prevailing when transactions occur 
the related translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity under the heading accumulated other comprehensive loss 
accumulated other comprehensive loss reported in the consolidated balance sheets consists only of foreign currency translation adjustments 
at the fiscal years ended september  and  the accumulated foreign currency translation loss totaled approximately  and  respectively 
the company does not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
income taxes the company has deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that expire at different times through and until significant judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
factors such as future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  changes in enacted tax rates and the period over which the company s deferred tax assets will be recoverable are considered in making these determinations 
the company s domestic operations have been profitable during the past three years while international operations have continued to generate operating losses 
during fiscal  the company increased sales and marketing expense by approximately and introduced a subscription sales model  both of which could have an adverse effect on profitability in the near term 
accordingly  management does not believe the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized and a full valuation allowance  previously provided against the deferred tax assets  continues to be provided 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and  if current economic conditions change or future results of operations are better than expected  future assessments may result in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are realizable 
if this conclusion were reached  the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be reduced resulting in a tax benefit being recorded for financial reporting purposes

working capital decreased by  during fiscal during fiscal  approximately  of cash was provided by the company s operations as compared to approximately  of cash provided by operations during fiscal during fiscal  and  management took a series of steps to reduce operating expenses and to restructure operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for a further discussion of the reductions in the workforce as well as other restructuring actions taken to reduce operating expenses 
these restructurings significantly reduced the company s operating expenses allowing the company to generate previously noted operating income for fiscal  and the company continues to closely monitor its operating expenses and capital expenditures  as exhibited by its slightly decreased engineering and product development and general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal in an effort to increase revenue  the company increased its sales and marketing expenditures by approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company expects to continue the increases in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal  but will continue to closely monitor its operating expenses and capital expenditures against anticipated revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of  is primarily the result of profitable operations and an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable  offset by an increase in accounts receivable  and a decrease in deferred revenue 
the increase in accrued expenses is primarily the result of increased accruals for employee bonuses and sales commission increase of  compared to september   outside professional services increase of  compared to september   employee benefits principally for accrued vacation and sick time increase of  compared to september   and royalties due to outside developers increase of  compared to september  
the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increased expense levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period of fiscal the increase in accounts receivable is primarily the result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period of fiscal  while the decrease in deferred revenue is primarily the result of decreased maintenance deferrals for the company s international subsidiaries  partially offset by an increase in maintenance deferrals for the company s domestic operations 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal of  is primarily the result of the acquisition of mergence technologies net cash used of  the purchase of fixed assets  primarily computer equipment and software  and the investment in capitalized software development  partially offset by a decrease in other assets  primarily from changes in restricted cash and rent deposits 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal of  is primarily the result of the cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
on october   the company s bank line of credit  which provided for maximum borrowings of the lesser of  or of defined eligible receivables and was collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company  expired 
the company was offered the option to renew its bank line of credit but decided  based on its positive cash flow during the past two fiscal years and the current level of its cash holdings  that it was in the company s best interest to forego the expense required to continue the line of credit and  therefore  did not renew the line of credit 
during fiscal  the company introduced a subscription sales model for the sale of its enterprise products 
this new pricing model allows customers to begin using the company s products at a lower initial cost of software acquisition when compared to the more traditional perpetual license sale 
while this initiative is designed to increase the number of enterprise solutions sold and also reduce dependency on short term sales by building a recurring revenue stream  it introduces increased risks for the company primarily associated with the timing of revenue recognition and reduced cash flows 
the subscription model delays revenue recognition when compared to the typical perpetual license sale and also  as the company allows termination of certain subscriptions with days notice  could result in decreased revenue for solutions sold under the model if the company experiences a high percentage of subscription cancellations during the first two years of the subscription 
further  as amounts due from customers are invoiced over the life of the subscription  there are delayed cash flows from subscription sales when compared to perpetual license sales 
the mergence purchase agreement includes a provision for quarterly cash payments to the former mergence shareholders equal to of revenue  as defined  of the datawatch researcher product for a period of six years 
as the cash payments are based on recognized revenue and no minimum payments are required  they are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or cash flows 
see the section titled off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments included elsewhere herein for a more complete disclosure of the company s commitments and contingent liabilities 
management believes based on its current cash position and by continuing to closely monitor operating expenses and capital expenditures  the company will have sufficient liquidity through at least september  to fund its cash requirements 
management believes that the company s current operations have not been materially impacted by the effects of inflation

while this initiative is designed to increase the number of enterprise solutions sold and also reduce dependency on short term sales by building a recurring revenue stream  it introduces increased risks for the company primarily associated with the timing of revenue recognition and reduced cash flows 
the subscription model delays revenue recognition when compared to the typical perpetual license sale and also  as the company allows termination of certain subscriptions with days notice  could result in decreased revenue for solutions sold under the model if the company experiences a high percentage of subscription cancellations during the first two years of the subscription 
further  as amounts due from customers are invoiced over the life of the subscription  there are delayed cash flows from subscription sales when compared to perpetual license sales 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s future operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter because of uncertainties and or risks associated with such things as technological change  competition  and delays in the introduction of products or product enhancements and general market trends 
historically  the company has operated with little backlog of orders because its software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
further  the company s introduction of the subscription sales model could result in decreased revenues over the short term 
because the company s staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s costs are fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
because of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such variations in operating results in the future or that such variations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
weakening of world wide economic conditions and the computer software market may result in lower revenue growth rates or decreased revenues the revenue growth and profitability of the company s business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the markets in which it competes 
because the company s sales are primarily to major corporate customers  its business also depends on general economic and business conditions 
a softening of demand for computer software and services  caused by a weakening of the economy in the united states or abroad  may result in lower revenue growth rates  decreased revenues and reduced profitability 
in addition  terrorist attacks against the united states  and the united states military response to these attacks have added to economic and political uncertainty which may adversely affect worldwide demand for computer software and services and result in significant fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
in a weakened economy  the company cannot be assured that it will be able to effectively promote future growth in its software and services revenues or maintain profitability 
dependence on principal products in fiscal  monarch  visual qsm and visual hd  and datawatch es accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company is wholly dependent on the monarch  visual qsm  visual hd  datawatch es and the recently acquired datawatch researcher products 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of any of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of its new and enhanced versions of these products and development of new versions of these and other products and subsequent acceptance of such new and enhanced products 
in addition  competitive pressures or other factors may result in significant price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
international sales in fiscal  and  international sales  including export sales from domestic operations  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of its total revenue 
a significant portion of the company s total revenue will therefore be subject to risks associated with international sales  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  possible effects of war and acts of terrorism  difficulties in account receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse tax consequences 
acquisition strategy as evidenced by its august acquisition of mergence technologies corporation and its october acquisition of auxilor inc  the company continues to address the need to develop new products  in part  through the acquisition of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving and maintaining the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies business is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
dependence on new introductions  new product delays growth in the company s business depends in substantial part on the continuing introduction of new products 
the length of product life cycles depends in part on end user demand for new or additional functionality in the company s products 
if the company fails to accurately anticipate the demand for  or encounters any significant delays in developing or introducing  new products or additional functionality on its products  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business 
product life cycles can also be affected by the introduction by suppliers of operating systems of comparable functionality within their products 
the failure of the company to anticipate the introduction of additional functionality in products developed by such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company s competitors may introduce products with more features and lower prices than the company s products 
such increase in competition could adversely affect the life cycles of the company s products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
software products may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential end users  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
rapid technological change the markets in which the company competes have undergone  and can be expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change 
the ability of the company to grow will depend on its ability to successfully update and improve its existing products and market and license new products to meet the changing demands of the marketplace and that can compete successfully with the existing and new products of the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully anticipate and satisfy the changing demands of the personal computer software marketplace  that the company will be able to continue to enhance its product offerings  or that technological changes in hardware platforms or software operating systems  or the introduction of a new product by a competitor  will not render the company s products obsolete 
competition in the pc software industry the software market for personal computers is highly competitive and characterized by continual change and improvement in technology 
several of the company s existing and potential competitors  including bmc software  actuate corporation  mobius management systems  inc  and others  have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will have the resources required to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on proprietary software technology the company s success is dependent upon proprietary software technology 
although the company does not own any patents on any such technology  it does hold exclusive licenses to such technology and relies principally on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect its rights to such proprietary technology 
despite such precautions  there can be no assurance that such steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of such technology 
reliance on software license agreements substantially all of the company s products incorporate third party proprietary technology which is generally licensed to the company on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
failure by such third parties to continue to develop technology for the company and license such technology to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on the ability to hire and retain skilled personnel qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
the company s success depends  in large part  upon its ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly  technical personnel such and product development and professional services personnel  sales and marketing personnel and other senior personnel 
the company s failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are integral to the company s product development  professional services and direct sales teams may limit the rate at which the company can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
a change in key management could result in transition and attrition in the affected department 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
indirect distribution channels the company sells a significant portion of its products through resellers  none of which are under the direct control of the company 
the loss of major resellers of the company s products  or a significant decline in their sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain additional qualified resellers or that any such resellers will be able to effectively sell the company s products 
the company seeks to select and retain resellers on the basis of their business credentials and their ability to add value through expertise in specific vertical markets or application programming expertise 
in addition  the company relies on resellers to provide post sales service and support  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business 
volatility of stock price as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating companies acquired by the company  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of the company 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at september   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial and commodity instruments 
the company holds no investment securities that possess significant market risk 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposure is currency exchange rate risk 
international revenues and expenses are generally translated by the company s foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are denominated in local currency 
approximately  and of the company s revenues for  and  respectively  were from foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  approximately  and of the company s expenses for fiscal  and  respectively  were from foreign subsidiaries 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its international subsidiaries are almost exclusively conducted in their respective local currencies and dollar advances to the company s international subsidiaries  if any  are usually considered to be of a long term investment nature 
therefore  the majority of currency movements are reflected in the company s other comprehensive income 
there are  however  certain situations where the company will invoice customers in currencies other than its own 
such gains or losses  when realized  are reflected in income 
these have not been material in the past nor does management believe that they will be material in the future 
currently the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
