item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty 
we undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements 
should events occur subsequent to the filing of this form k that require us to update the forward looking information contained in this form k  the updated information will be filed with the sec in a quarterly report on form q or a form k  or disclosed in a press release 
as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements 
overview aerogen  inc aerogen  the company or we was incorporated in november we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on respiratory therapy in the acute care setting 
based upon our proprietary and commercially proven onq aerosol generator  we are developing respiratory products for marketing by us  and products in collaboration with  and for marketing by  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for both respiratory therapy and for the delivery of drugs through the lungs to the bloodstream 
in  we had two nebulizer products on the market 
we have an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  in  we generated significant revenues from our planned principal operations and exited the development stage 
however  we will continue to devote substantial efforts to the development of current and future products 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years and expect cumulative losses to increase  primarily due to the costs associated with the manufacturing and marketing of our products  the expansion of our research and development activities and the general expansion of our business activities 
we anticipate that our quarterly results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
therefore  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
our sources of working capital have primarily been equity financings  convertible debentures  product revenues  research and development revenues  license fees  royalties  and interest earned on investments 
in june we launched our first commercial product  the aeroneb portable nebulizer system  a simple  compact and silent nebulizer for use in the home setting 
in june we launched the aeroneb professional nebulizer system  developed for use in a hospital setting including the treatment of patients on ventilators 
in december  we announced fda marketing clearance for the aeroneb go nebulizer  which began shipping in january all of our products incorporate our onq aerosol generator 
since the launch of the first aeroneb product  we have recorded cumulative revenues of million associated with sales of the aeroneb products and component parts as of december  the aeroneb portable nebulizer system has been promoted in the united states by a small contract sales force under contract from a division of cardinal health  and by several home medical equipment distributors 
the aeroneb pro is available in the united states where it is sold by puritan bennett as an accessory to ventilators and through cardinal health 
the aeroneb pro is available in over countries worldwide under agreements with puritan bennett and independent distributors in select countries 
in june  we made initial commercial shipments of our aeroneb go product to norway  via our distributor normed  as part of a test market 
in september  we entered into an agreement with medical industries america inc mia for marketing and manufacturing of the aeroneb go  under which mia has exclusive rights to manufacture and market the product in the united states and certain countries worldwide  including the major markets of europe and japan 
in connection with our agreement with mia  we received upfront payments from mia totaling million in  in addition  aerogen is supplying its onq aerosol generators to mia under a transfer pricing arrangement  and mia will pay us royalties on its gross sales of the aeroneb go and mia s sales of accessories 
first commercial shipments occurred in the united states in january we perform feasibility and initial development work to customize our nebulizers and inhalers to deliver specific drugs  for our own account or under agreement with third parties who compensate us for expenses incurred in performing this work 
once feasibility is demonstrated for a potential product  we may seek to enter into a development agreement with the corporate partner holding the commercial rights to the compound to be used in the product 
we expect to receive payments from partners for the development of products under contract for reimbursement of development expenses incurred under an approved work plan  and royalties on future total product sales similar collaborations  and royalties based on partner sales of products  if and when commercialized 
we recognize research and development revenues as reimbursable research and development expenses are incurred 
we also expect to receive revenue from the manufacturing of products and we expect to out license marketing and or manufacturing rights to products or territories that do not fit within our area of commercial focus 
we have incurred stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation included in research and development expenses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation included in selling  general and administrative expenses was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and as of december   there was approximately million of remaining deferred stock based compensation  which will continue to be amortized to expense on a straight line basis through we anticipate incurring additional stock based compensation expense in the future as a result of fluctuations in the market value of our common stock  which will continue to have a direct impact on the value of common stock options held by non employees 
we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  we also had aggregate federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million each as of december  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in for federal purposes and for state purposes  if not utilized 
due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate utilization of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards  we have not recorded any benefit for losses  and a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire amount of the net deferred tax asset 
utilization of net operating losses and credits may be substantially limited by the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before they can be used 
during  we had two reductions in force  one in january and one in june  terminating the employment of a total of employees 
the prospective annualized payroll related savings resulting from the reductions in force was million  the majority of which was in research and development 
severance related costs were million  all of which was expensed and paid during in december  we began a restructuring  which included the suspension of further development of our aerodose insulin inhaler  followed by an additional reduction in force in january terminating employees with an annualized payroll related savings of million 
severance related costs were million  all of which was expensed and paid during the quarter ending march  in january  we announced a furlough of nine employees  seven of which were subsequently terminated on march  critical accounting policies and estimates aerogen s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including inventories  bad debts  intangible assets including goodwill  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have an irish subsidiary  which accounted for approximately of our net loss for the year ended december  and of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary from the currency in which it keeps its accounting records into united states dollars 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency 
the determination of the functional currency is based on our judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstance affecting the subsidiary 
based on our assessment  we consider our irish subsidiary s local currency  the euro  to be the functional currency 
accordingly we had cumulative translation gains losses of approximately   and  which were in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheets at december   and  respectively 
during  and  respectively  translation adjustments of   and  respectively  were recorded as components of other comprehensive loss 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiary was the united states dollar  these gains losses would have affected our net losses for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly different from those noted in each of these years 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates or material usage differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we record revenues from product sales at the time of product shipment  provided an enforceable claim exists  any significant rights to return product have expired and collection of the receivable is probable 
to date  we have made minor discounts to revenue for one customer program or incentive offering  which was done at the time of the sale to this customer 
if we determined to take additional actions to initiate such incentive offerings  such action might result in a reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
our assessment of the facts at a given time may result in revenues being recorded in a period other than what they would have been  based on actual subsequent events 
we review the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
if conditions change  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and product sales 
product sales were million in  million in and million in we launched our first commercial product  the aeroneb portable nebulizer system  in june and our second commercial product  the aeroneb pro in june the increase in product sales for the year ended over was due to the launch of the aeroneb pro in june the increase in product sales in over was due to a full year of sales for the aeroneb pro in research and development revenues 
research and development revenues were million in  million in and million in the revenue decrease in compared with resulted from the ending of the puritan bennett contract in the revenue decrease in as compared to resulted from decreased development activities for chiron of million  partially offset by development activities for other partners of million 
research and development revenues can be expected to vary from period to period based on the activities requested by partners in any particular period  and therefore are not predictable 
royalty and other revenues 
royalty and other revenues were million in  million in and million in the increase in royalty and other revenue in over was partially due to up front payments associated with the october commercial agreement with mia  which resulted in the amortization of million of a million upfront payment which is being amortized ratably over the five year term of the agreement 
additionally  in  a consumer company that has licensed our aerosol generator technology for use in the field of air fresheners and insect repellants introduced the first product outside the united states  which caused the minimum royalty payment to increase to million from million in and cost of products sold 
cost of products sold was million in  million in and million in in the average cost of sales was  down from in  and negative gross margins in in  the average cost of sales was lower than in due to the change in product mix  and to improvements in our manufacturing processes 
in  the cost of products sold was high as a percentage of product sales due primarily to low yields early in the year associated with the start up of the commercial manufacturing processes and the move to the new facility in mountain view  california 
during the second half of  we saw improved margins as volumes increased and as we completed our move into our new facility  which incorporates more automated manufacturing processes and improved environmental controls 
we anticipate that costs per unit will decrease over time as volumes increase  and as we refine our manufacturing processes and focus on cost reductions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in research and development expenses of million in compared with was primarily due to a reduction of million in payroll related expenses and million in stock compensation expenses associated with the reductions in force  a reduction of million in expenses associated with a halt to development of the commercial version of the aerodose insulin inhaler  reductions of million in expense associated with the completion of the development of an aerodose respiratory inhaler  reductions in facility related expenses of million  and other spending reductions of million  partially offset by increased spending in amikacin clinical trials of million 
the decrease in research and development expenses in compared with was primarily due to a million decrease in expenses associated with finalizing the commercial version of the aerodose insulin inhaler and the completion of phase a clinical trials for the insulin program 
in addition  in  there was a reduction of million in payroll related expenses associated with the reductions in force  reductions in expense with the finalizing the development of an aerodose respiratory inhaler of million and other spending reductions of million  partially offset by increased facility and information technology related expenses of million 
research and development expenses relate to our own research and development projects  as well as the costs related to development activities for our partners 
development expenses for partner activities approximate revenues from those partners 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for scientific and development personnel  laboratory supplies  consulting services  clinical expenses and the expenses associated with the development of manufacturing processes  in each case including related overhead 
we expect research and development spending to increase over the next several years as we increase clinical activities and expand our research and development activities in support of our products and those which we develop in partner collaborations 
the increase in research and development expenditures cannot be predicted reliably  as it depends in part upon our success in entering into new partnering agreements and the timing of development and clinical activities that are largely controlled by our partners 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense for as compared to was primarily due to reductions in payroll related expenses of million and million in stock compensation expenses associated with the reduction in force  reductions in trades shows and advertising expenses of million  and reductions in outside services of million  partially offset by a million increase in legal expenses and a million increase in insurance expense 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to was primarily due to the increased facility expenses associated with the new mountain view facility of million  an incremental million increase associated with the outside sales force  and an incremental million of stock compensation expense amortized in partially offsetting the increases were reductions in payroll related expenses of million associated with the reduction in force  reductions in advertising expenses of million  and reductions in consulting expenses of million 
in addition  the amortization of goodwill was discontinued in in accordance with sfas resulting in a million reduction of expenses 
litigation settlement 
in october of  we settled a lawsuit brought by us against bd 
under the settlement agreement  we paid bd a total of million  in two equal installments  in october and february as a result of the settlement  we own all of the intellectual property developed by either party under the now terminated agreement  and bd has a non exclusive license to certain technology developed by bd under the agreement for use outside the field of inhaled insulin 
the litigation settlement was immediately expensed to operations  as the technology acquired will be used in conjunction with a product that had not yet been approved for sale by regulatory authorities 
interest and other income  net 
net interest expense was million in  compared with million of net interest income in and million of net interest income in the growth in interest expense is primarily due to imputed interest resulting from the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debenture and the value associated with the warrants issued to sf capital in totaling million 
there was no interest expense for or interest income in was million compared with million in and million in the decrease in interest income in compared to is primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances  and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
the decrease in interest income in  as compared to was primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances  and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
we report segments in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires the use of a management approach in identifying segments of an enterprise 
the company consists of one operating segment 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through equity and convertible debt financings  product revenues  research and development revenues  licensing fees  royalties  and the interest earned on related proceeds 
we have received approximately million aggregate net proceeds from sales of our common and preferred stock through december   including approximately million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in november in the year ended december   million was raised through the issuance of convertible notes 
as of december   aerogen had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  which was subsequently augmented on january   by million from the issuance of a secured convertible debenture to the carpenter family trust  the trustees of which are aerogen s chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
jane shaw and her husband peter carpenter 
on march   aerogen completed the first closing of a million equity financing that provided gross proceeds of approximately million 
the second closing is expected to provide an additional million of gross proceeds and is conditioned upon approval of aerogen s stockholders 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   was million  primarily due to the operating loss of million  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million  depreciation expense of million  amortization of stock based compensation of million  amortization of discounts on notes of million and deferred rent of million 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   was million  primarily due to the net operating loss of million and the payment of accrued liabilities of million  partially offset by the amortization of stock based compensation of million  and depreciation of million 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to the operating loss of million  partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of million  primarily due to the million accrual for litigation settlement  depreciation expense of million  and amortization of stock based compensation of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million and was due to the maturity of available for sale securities of million  partially offset by million for acquisition of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million and was due to the maturity of available for sale securities of million  partially offset by million for the purchase of available for sale securities and million for acquisition of property and equipment 
for the year ended december   cash used by investing activities was million  and resulted primarily from the addition of leasehold improvements  which amounted to million  acquisition of property and equipment  which was million  and the net purchase of available for sale securities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  million was provided by the sale of two separate convertible debentures  and a minimal amount was provided by purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  approximately million was provided almost equally by repayment of earlier loans to stockholder executives  and by purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  approximately million was provided by purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the development of our technology and future products requires a commitment of substantial funds to conduct the costly and time consuming research and development and clinical trials required to develop and refine our technology and future products and to bring those products to market 
our future capital requirements and operating expenses will depend on many factors including  but not limited to  research and development activities  the timing  cost  extent and results of clinical trials  our success in licensing drugs for use in our products  regulatory approvals  the status of competitive products  manufacturing and marketing costs associated with commercialization of products  costs involved in obtaining and maintaining patents  and our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative agreements 
the company will need additional capital in the future 
the first closing of our recent equity financing on march  provided us with funds to continue operations through approximately april should our stockholders fail to approve the second closing  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financings to continue our operations on a longer term basis 
we currently have no material commitment for capital expenditures 
we have a five year lease for our mountain view facility that was originally signed in october of and amended in november of and in march of under the original lease agreement  our total lease obligation through was approximately million  plus approximately million of common area maintenance fees 
under the amended lease agreement  our total lease obligation through is approximately million  plus approximately million of common area maintenance fees  and the company was required to relinquish to our landlord the remaining  balance of its standby letter of credit  and make additional cash payments to our landlord in the first half of totaling  in addition  we have a commitment of approximately million to irish investors under a tax advantaged business expansion scheme that must be repaid out of the operating profits  if any  of our irish subsidiary 
our long term liquidity also depends upon our ability to attract and maintain collaborative relationships  to increase revenues from the sale of our products  to develop and market new products and ultimately  to achieve profitability 
as of december   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments of approximately million as shown in the table below  million of which related to the operating lease of our facility in mountain view  ca  and which excludes obligations related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business 
contractual obligations payments due by period as of december  total less than one year years years more than years in thousands operating lease      convertible debentures   total      under the terms of our march lease amendment  our revised operating lease obligations are as follows total less than one year years years more than years we have no relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
we have two debt arrangements with restrictive covenants  which limit our ability to assume additional indebtedness  dispose of assets  pay dividends  create or incur liens  or make guaranties without the prior written consent of the debenture holders 
as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires companies to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
interest rate risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in government notes and money market funds and are generally of a short term nature 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our future results of operations 
exchange rate risk 
due to our irish operations  we have market risk exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
the revenues and expenses of our subsidiary  aerogen ireland limited  are denominated in its local currency 
effective january  the irish subsidiary s functional currency became the euro previously the irish punt 
at the end of each period  the revenues and expenses of our subsidiary are translated into united states dollars using the average currency rate in effect for that period  and assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the end of that period 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in united states dollars 
to date  we have not experienced any significant negative impact as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency markets 
as a policy  we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold financial instruments for trading purposes 
if we expand our overseas operations  our operating results may become subject to more significant fluctuations based on changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
we will periodically analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may adjust our policies to allow for financial hedging techniques to minimize exchange rate risk 
risk factors our business and the value of our stock are subject to a number of risks  many of which are set out below 
additional risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently believe are immaterial  may also impair our business 
if any of these risks actually materialize  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  which would likely have a corresponding impact on the value of our common stock 
these risk factors should be reviewed carefully 
we will need additional capital in the future 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
on january   the company issued a certain debenture and warrant in exchange for approximately  in gross proceeds 
on march   we entered into an agreement to sell certain equity securities for a total of million in gross proceeds 
on march   we completed a first closing of that financing for gross proceeds of million 
the net proceeds from this first closing provided us with funds to continue operations through approximately april a second closing for gross proceeds of million is conditioned on stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders  which is scheduled for may  should our stockholders fail to approve this second closing  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  sale of certain of our assets  collaborative relationships or other arrangements in order to continue our operations on a longer term basis 
we cannot be certain that alternative funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  additional equity or debt financing may involve substantial dilution to our existing stockholders  restrictive covenants or high interest rates 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to either certain of our products or technologies or desirable marketing territories  or all of these 
we may also explore other potential options  such as a merger or sale 
if the stockholders reject the second closing  and our efforts to secure alternative funding are unsuccessful  we will have to significantly curtail our operations 
even if the stockholders approve the second closing  or we are successful at raising alternative funds to continue our operations  our cash requirements may increase in the future because of our research and development efforts  including clinical trials  capital expenditures and the manufacture and marketing of our products 
in order for any of our drug products to complete phase clinical trials  we will most likely need capital in excess of our current cash resources 
even if our stockholders approve the second closing of the million equity financing  our cash resources will most likely be insufficient to complete phase clinical trials for any of our products  and may be insufficient to complete all of our anticipated phase clinical trials 
sufficient cash to complete our phase and clinical trials may be provided from strategic partnerships  such as from out licensing and partnering of our insulin product  and product sales in excess of our expectations 
there can be no guarantee  however  that these capital resources will materialize in sufficient magnitude or at all  or that product sales will meet our expectations 
in the alternative  the company will have to raise significant capital through the sale of convertible debt  convertible securities  and or common stock  and there can be no guarantee that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all  and could result in significant dilution to our current shareholders 
our march equity financing has resulted in a concentration of ownership  which will only intensify if our stockholders approve the second closing of that financing 
following the first closing of the million series a preferred equity financing  twelve series a investors own equity securities that  if all such securities were converted into common stock  would represent ownership of approximately two thirds of the then outstanding common shares of the company 
while each of these investors is contractually prohibited from owning more than of the company s common stock at any one time  as few as eleven of these investors  or investors to whom the a securities are resold  could acquire in excess of of the voting securities of the company without exceeding this limitation 
to our knowledge  the series a investors have not acted as a group in seeking  negotiating  or making their investment in the company  have not acted as a group since making their investment  and consider themselves to be independent investors 
following the second closing  if approved by our stockholders  the series a investors will own equity securities that  if all such securities were converted into common stock  would represent ownership of approximately of the then outstanding common shares of the company 
due to the termination of our rights plan  there can be no assurance that further concentration of ownership will not occur  or that these securities will not be resold to different investors who may or may not act as a group 
we have a history of losses  anticipate future losses and may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we have never been profitable 
through december   we have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial losses over at least the next several years as we expand our research and development efforts  expand our preclinical and clinical testing activities  expand our manufacturing efforts  including our commercial production capability  and build our sales and marketing capabilities and launch our products currently being developed 
to achieve and sustain profitability  we must  alone or with others  develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  market and sell products 
we cannot be sure that we will generate sufficient product revenues  royalties or research and development revenues to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet the expectations of investors 
we expect that our operating results may fluctuate in the future  and may vary from investors expectations  depending on a number of factors described in this risk factors section including demand for our existing products and any we may introduce in the future  timing of the introduction of new products and enhancements of existing products  changes in domestic and international economic  business  regulatory  industry and political conditions  allocation of our resources  particularly when they are limited  and the costs and expenses relating to any litigation 
the ability to successfully identify and consummate appropriate collaborations with corporate partners  and our manufacturing  development and marketing partners changing priorities and resources 
we have a significant backlog of unfilled orders for our products that may adversely impact our distributors ability or willingness to sell our products 
due to our extremely limited cash resources at the end of and during the first quarter of  we were at times unable to procure critical components and or manufacturing services necessary to satisfy customer demand for our products  most of whom were unable to provide cash payments in a timeframe that resolved our procurement issues 
compounding this limitation  orders in the same time period exceeded our expectations 
as a result  we currently have a backlog of orders that we believe will not be completely filled until late in the second quarter of  assuming that new orders in the second quarter of do not materially exceed our revised expectations 
as of april   the current value of this backlog is approximately thousand 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market prices for securities of many companies in the life sciences industry have historically been highly volatile  and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
prices for our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including market conditions relating to the life sciences industry  investor perception of us as a company  securities analysts recommendations  delays in the development  regulatory approval or commercialization of our products  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us  our partners or competitors  failure to establish new collaborative relationships or termination of existing collaborative relationships  developments or disputes concerning patent or intellectual property rights  regulatory and pricing developments in both the united states and foreign countries  public concern as to the safety of drugs and drug delivery technologies  including those of our competitors  period to period fluctuations in financial results  and economic and other external factors 
our common stock is currently trading at a market price significantly below the initial public offering price 
there can be no assurance that the price will increase in the future or will recover to the initial public offering price 
many of our products are in research and development stages  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
many of our products are in the research or development stages 
before we can begin to commercialize our new products  we will need to invest in substantial additional activities  generally including the conduct of clinical trials 
to further develop our products  we will need to obtain additional funds and address engineering and design issues  including ensuring that our products deliver a consistent and reproducible amount of drug to the lung and that they can be manufactured successfully 
we cannot assure that our research and development efforts will be successful  any of our inhaler  nebulizer or drug products will prove safe and effective  we will obtain regulatory clearance or approval to sell any additional products  or any of our existing or future products can be manufactured in commercial quantities or at an acceptable cost or marketed successfully 
our technologies are relatively unproven  so they may not work effectively or safely enough to commercialize inhalers  nebulizers or drug containing products 
since our pulmonary drug delivery technologies are new and relatively unproven  many of our products are currently in the research  development or clinical stages 
extensive additional testing will need to be performed to demonstrate that drugs may be safely and effectively delivered using our technologies  our inhalers and nebulizers are safe across a range of drugs and formulations  our products consistently deliver accurate and reproducible amounts of drug over time  and drug formulations are stable in our products 
if our products do not prove to be safe and effective  we may be required to abandon some or all of them 
if we cannot develop new products  our business will suffer 
if clinical trials of our drug products are not successful  drug products using our inhalers or nebulizers may not be commercialized 
before either we or our partners can file for regulatory approval for the commercial sale of combination products using our inhalers or our nebulizers  the fda  and other governmental agencies in other countries  will require extensive clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy 
we are developing drug inhaler and drug nebulizer combinations  each of which will require clinical testing 
to date  we have completed limited clinical trials using prototype inhalers and nebulizers 
if we do not successfully complete appropriate clinical trials  we will not be able to commercialize our products 
the results of initial clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results of more extensive clinical trials 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that clinical trials of our products will demonstrate that they are safe and effective to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
we have limited experience manufacturing our technology 
we depend on key suppliers and contract manufacturers  and their failure to supply us may delay or prevent commercialization of our products 
we have built our own manufacturing capabilities to produce key components of our products 
we have manufactured only limited quantities of our first three products  and limited clinical supplies of other products 
we currently produce all of our aerosol generators for our products  partnered or not  in a single facility 
we plan to continue using contract manufacturers to produce certain other key components and subassemblies of our products  many of which are produced in unique facilities and or with unique tooling 
we may assemble some of our products ourselves  or we may use contract manufacturers for the final assembly of all of our products 
we do not have long term supply contracts with most of our key suppliers or contract manufacturers 
in addition  most of them are currently our sole source of supply 
we may not be able to enter into  or maintain  satisfactory contracts or arrangements 
in addition  manufacturing of our products could be delayed by supply problems at our suppliers or contract manufacturers 
if we need to qualify a new supplier or redesign the product  there could be significant delay  and a regulatory filing could be required before we could use the new supplier to provide material for our products 
there can be no assurance that we  or our contract manufacturers  can successfully manufacture in high volumes in a timely manner  at an acceptable cost  or at all 
we cannot assure that the design of our products will permit their manufacture on a commercially sustainable scale  manufacturing and quality control problems will not arise as we attempt to scale up production  or any scale up of production can be achieved in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost 
failure to address these issues adequately could delay or prevent clinical testing and commercialization of our products 
our aerodose inhaled insulin product is our most mature product in development for systemic drug delivery  however  we have suspended development of that product 
we have completed four small clinical trials two phase and two phase a of our aerodose insulin inhaler product 
early studies generally focus on the safety of a product rather than its effectiveness in treating the disease 
we cannot be sure that the results of these and or other additional clinical trials will prove the safety and effectiveness of our product 
we have not secured an agreement with a marketing partner to fund the additional development and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval and to commercialize the product  therefore we have not yet resumed our work on that product  and do not expect to re start the program until we have an acceptable partner to pay for additional clinical trials 
we cannot assure that we will ever be able to enter into a satisfactory agreement with a marketing partner  and we currently do not have sufficient funds to conduct the necessary development and clinical programs ourselves 
our ability to market and sell our products depends upon receiving regulatory approvals  which we may not obtain 
our products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  state and local government agencies  and by international regulatory authorities 
these agencies regulate the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of medical devices  drugs and biologics 
if we  or our partners  fail to obtain regulatory clearances or approval to develop or to market our products  our business will be harmed and we  or our collaborative partners  will not be able to market and sell our products 
even if granted  regulatory approvals may include significant limitations on the uses for which products may be tested or marketed 
once obtained  required approvals may be withdrawn  or we may not remain in compliance with regulatory requirements 
the process for obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for drugs and biologics is generally lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals in multiple countries is expensive  and we cannot be certain that we will receive approvals in any foreign country in which we or our partners plan to market our products 
if we or our partners fail to obtain regulatory approval in the united states or in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products  our revenues will be lower 
a longer than expected regulatory process  additional or significant changes in regulatory requirements  or more expensive clinical studies than we anticipate  may cause us to stop development of particular products 
we may not be able to develop certain products if we do not enter into additional collaborative relationships or gain access to compounds from third parties 
our strategy depends partially on our ability to enter into collaborative relationships with partners to conduct and fund the clinical trials  manufacturing  marketing and sales activities necessary to commercialize certain products 
to develop products to be marketed by us  we will need to purchase or license  and possibly reformulate and package  drugs for use with our aerodose inhalers and aeroneb nebulizers 
we cannot assure that we will be able to establish these kinds of arrangements on favorable terms  or at all  or that our existing or future collaborative arrangements will be successful 
if our products do not gain commercial acceptance  we will not generate significant revenue 
our success in commercializing our products depends on many factors  including acceptance by healthcare professionals and patients 
their acceptance of our products will depend largely on our ability to demonstrate that our products can compete with alternative delivery systems with respect to safety  efficacy  the benefits associated with pulmonary delivery  ease of use  and price 
we cannot be sure that our products will compete effectively  or that we  or our partners  will be able to successfully market any products in a timely manner 
if we are unable to develop a successful sales and marketing effort  we will not be able to sustainably commercialize our products 
we currently have a small sales and marketing staff and modest marketing budget  and many of our competitors have substantial sales and marketing infrastructures and significant marketing budgets 
we rely on third party distributors to sell our products  some of which have limited experience in the markets that we are trying to access 
our success in commercializing our respiratory products in the united states and worldwide will depend on our and our partners ability to develop and execute a successful sales and marketing effort 
there can be no assurance that our current products  which include the aeroneb pro system and the aeroneb go nebulizer will be successful 
in any event  these products are not expected to generate revenues sufficient enough to solely support the company s operations in the foreseeable future 
we will initially have financial losses resulting from the marketing and sales expenditures necessary to launch and grow the products 
our distribution and marketing partners have significant discretion in allocating and applying their selling and marketing efforts  so we have limited ability to predict or manage the end user acceptance of our products  and there can be no guarantee that we can meet demand that rises sharply as a result of our partners selling and or marketing efforts 
our corporate partners may not commercialize our products or may develop products that compete against our products 
our business model includes collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into arrangements that result in successful commercial products 
even if we do enter into such arrangements  we will depend on corporate partners to commercialize the products developed in collaboration with us 
if any of our existing or future corporate partners do not complete the development and commercialization of products to which they have obtained rights from us  our business could be impaired 
in the drug delivery industry  it is common for corporate partners to conduct feasibility studies with multiple partners 
there can be no assurance that our existing or future corporate partners will continue to choose our technology over their own technology or that of our competitors 
collaboration agreements generally provide that the partner can terminate the agreement at any time 
if we are unable to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel necessary for our business  we may not be able to develop our products successfully 
because of the specialized nature of our business  we depend upon qualified scientific  engineering  technical and managerial personnel 
in particular  our business and prospects depend in large part upon the continued employment of dr 
jane e 
shaw  our chairman and chief executive officer 
we do not have an employment agreement with dr 
shaw 
even with the recent downturn in the global economy  there is intense competition for qualified personnel in our business 
in addition  our location in northern california makes recruiting qualified personnel from outside the san francisco bay area more difficult due to the very high cost of housing 
therefore  we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary to grow our business 
the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical  engineering and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would harm our research and development programs and our business 
if our manufacturing facilities  or those of our subcontractors and or licensees  do not meet federal  state and international manufacturing standards  we may not be able to sell our products in the united states or internationally 
our manufacturing facilities  and those of our subcontractors and manufacturing licensee mia  are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated by the fda for compliance with qsr 
we moved into a new facility in mountain view  california during the second quarter of prior to transferring product manufacturing to this facility  we underwent a successful inspection by the fda  which was completed in may we received our registration in august we registered with the fda an additional manufacturing site in galway  ireland  in april in september  the site in galway underwent an inspection by the fda 
two observations were noted 
one addressed the manner in which aerogen records documented in process acceptance test results and the other addressed the calibration standard operating procedure sop and equipment that was no longer in use  but had exceeded its calibration period 
we submitted a timely response to the fda  which was accepted and the was closed 
all medical devices marketed in the european union are required to bear the ce mark 
aerogen  mia and certain aerogen subcontractors are required to comply with the mdd and comply with iso  the international organization for standards  to meet the quality standards 
iso is a worldwide network of national standards institutes 
iso has developed iso in order to assist companies in implementing and operating quality management systems to meet the mdd 
in may of  the mountain view facility successfully obtained certification to iso if aerogen  mia or aerogen s subcontractors fail to maintain compliance with qsrs  iso or other international regulatory requirements  we may be required to among other things recall product or cease all or part of our operations until we comply with the regulations 
we cannot be certain that our facilities  or those of mia and or our subcontractors  will be found to comply on an ongoing basis with the qsrs  iso or other international regulatory requirements 
the state of california requires that we maintain a license to manufacture medical devices at our mountain view facility  and our facilities and manufacturing processes may be inspected from time to time to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations 
we are subject to licensing requirements and periodic inspections by the california department of health services  the county of santa clara and various environmental agencies 
if we are unable to maintain a license following any future inspections  we will be unable to manufacture or ship any products 
similar requirements exist in other jurisdictions where our products are manufactured 
we rely on several  sole source outside manufacturing service providers and raw material suppliers 
if one or more of these outside vendors becomes unable to supply us  we may be unable to locate an alternate supplier  which may adversely impact our ability to sell our products 
we outsource production of many components of our products to manufacturers in the united states and elsewhere 
generally  there is more than one potential supplier for these components  but some are manufactured to our specifications and an interruption in supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our products 
the brazing process used in assembly of our onq aerosol generators is conducted at a third party s facilities 
loss of the use of those facilities would result in several months delay in our supply of components while we establish an alternative brazing site 
palladium  which we use in our onq aperture plate  is expensive and is subject to price volatility 
the palladium plating bath chemicals we use to manufacture our onq aerosol generators are formulated by a single supplier 
our products may not be commercially viable if government health administration authorities  private health insurers or other third party payors do not provide adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our potential products will depend  in part  on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payors often challenge the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
there is significant uncertainty about the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
we cannot assure that any of our products will be reimbursed by third party payors 
in addition  we cannot assure that our products will be considered cost effective or that adequate third party reimbursement will be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a profit 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of health care products may change before our products are approved for marketing  and any such changes could further limit reimbursement 
one of our first commercial products  the aeroneb pro  is not currently reimbursed by insurance or government entities  which may limit its market penetration 
our competitors may be more successful in developing competing technologies and gaining market acceptance 
we currently compete with device and medical equipment companies for sales of our nebulizer products  as we introduce our drug products  we will compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  hospitals  research organizations  individual scientists and nonprofit organizations engaged in developing non invasive drug delivery dosage forms 
in the area of systemic drug delivery  competing non invasive alternatives to injectable drug delivery include oral  buccal  intranasal  transdermal and colonic absorption dosage forms 
we also compete with entities producing and developing injectable dosage forms 
several of these entities are working on sustained release injectable systems 
while these systems still require injections  the lower number of injections could allow these products to compete effectively with non invasive therapies 
many of these companies and entities have greater research and development  manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources and experience than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies and products  obtaining regulatory approval for products or gaining market acceptance more rapidly than we can 
if competitors bring effective products to market before we do  there is a risk that we may not be able to gain significant market share because our competitors may have firmly established their products in the market 
it is also possible that a competitor may develop a technology or product that renders our technology or products obsolete 
we may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  which could enable third parties to use our technology and impair our ability to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively depends in part on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our aerosolization technology 
we cannot be sure that the patents we have obtained  or any patents we may obtain as a result of our pending united states or international patent applications and  in particular  our vibratory aerosolization technology  which is technology that aerosolizes liquids by vibrating a metal plate that contains holes  will provide any competitive advantages for our products 
we also cannot assure that those patents will not be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure that competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  have not already applied for  or obtained  or will not seek to apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use and sell our products either in the united states or in international markets 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
we may not be aware of all of the patents and patent applications potentially adverse to our interests 
a number of pharmaceutical  medical device and other companies  as well as universities and research institutions  have filed patent applications or have issued patents relating to methods and apparatuses for aerosolization and pulmonary drug delivery 
we have become aware of  and may become aware of in the future  patent applications and issued patents that relate to certain aspects of the technology employed in our products  including certain aspects of vibratory aerosolization technology 
our pending patent applications  and those that we may file in the future  may not result in patents being issued 
we do not believe that our products currently infringe any valid and enforceable claims of the issued patents that we have reviewed 
however  if third party patents or patent applications contain claims infringed by our products and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid  we may not be able to obtain licenses to those patents at a reasonable cost  if at all  or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology 
our inability to do either would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we cannot assure that we will not have to defend ourselves in court against allegations of infringement of third party patents  or that such defense would be successful 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  which we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
we require our employees and key consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or a consulting relationship with us 
we cannot assure that employees or consultants will not breach these agreements  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors 
we have in the past and may become in the future subject to patent litigation  which has been and may be costly to defend and could invalidate our patents 
the pharmaceutical and medical device industries have been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in these industries have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we cannot assure that we will not become subject to  whether within or outside of the united states  patent infringement claims or litigation or interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office  uspto  to determine the priority of inventions 
although we prevailed in a interference proceeding before the uspto  that granted to aerogen all but one of the independent claims of bespak s  patent  we entered into a cross license agreement with bespak  as a result of which bespak has a license to certain of our technology  including the right to sublicense 
the scope of the granted license was limited to products employing technology which was disclosed by bespak in united states patent no 
 additionally  in april  we received notice that a german patent infringement suit had been filed by pari gmbh in the regional court in munich  germany alleging that aerogen s aeroneb pro product infringes a patent licensed to pari gmbh 
while the suit has not yet been formally initiated by the german regional court  we believe that it is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against all allegations in the suit 
in may  we filed an action in the german patent office requesting that the patent in question be rendered null and void 
our patent position involves complex legal and factual questions and is generally uncertain 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of patent claims in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field are evolving 
defending and prosecuting intellectual property suits  uspto interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time consuming 
further litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation or interference proceedings will be costly and will result in significant diversion of effort by technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in any of the litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to license disputed rights from third parties or require us to cease using such technology  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  which could include ongoing royalties 
we cannot assure that we can obtain the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if we were successfully sued for product liability  we could face substantial liabilities that may exceed our resources 
researching  developing and commercializing medical devices and pharmaceutical products entail significant product liability risks 
the use of our products in clinical trials and the commercial sale of our products may expose us to liability claims 
these claims might be made directly by consumers  by our partner companies or by others selling such products 
companies often address the exposure of this risk by obtaining product liability insurance 
although we currently have product liability insurance  we cannot assure that we can maintain such insurance or obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms in amounts sufficient to protect our business or at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we use hazardous and toxic materials and must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which can be expensive and restrict how we do business 
our operations involve the use of hazardous and toxic materials and generate hazardous  toxic and other wastes 
in particular  we use a special metal alloy to build our aerosol generators  a component of which is regulated as a hazardous material 
the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous and toxic materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and this liability could exceed our resources 
our operations could be shut down by government officials if we were not in compliance with environmental laws
