the terms greif  our company  we  us  and our as used in this discussion refer to greif  inc and subsidiaries 
our fiscal year begins on november and ends on october of the following year 
any references in this form k to the years  or  or to any quarter of those years  relate to the fiscal year ending in that year 
general business segments we operate in three business segments industrial packaging services  paper  packaging services  and timber 
we are a leading global provider of industrial packaging products such as steel  fibre and plastic drums  intermediate bulk containers  closure systems for industrial packaging products and polycarbonate water bottles 
we seek to provide complete packaging solutions to our customers by offering a comprehensive range of products and services on a global basis 
we sell our products to customers in industries such as chemicals  paints and pigments  food and beverage  petroleum  industrial coatings  agricultural  pharmaceutical and mineral  among others

as of october   we owned approximately  acres of timberland in the southeastern united states  which is actively managed  and approximately  acres of timberland in canada 
our timber management is focused on the active harvesting and regeneration of our timber properties to achieve sustainable long term yields on our timberland 
while timber sales are subject to fluctuations  we seek to maintain a consistent cutting schedule  within the limits of market and weather conditions 
acquisition of businesses and other significant transactions corrchoice  inc redemption of minority shareholders outstanding shares on september   corrchoice  inc together with its subsidiaries  corrchoice  which had been a greif joint venture  redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its minority shareholders for million  which was substantially funded by cash and cash equivalents of corrchoice 
as a result of this transaction  we now own of corrchoice  inc compared to our interest when the joint venture was formed on november  corrchoice s results were fully consolidated  net of intercompany eliminations  in our consolidated statement of income for  with a minority interest deduction through september  corrchoice s results were previously accounted for under the equity method because we lacked effective control 
corrchoice operates seven corrugated sheet feeder plants that supply converting operations in the eastern united states 
as a result of this transaction  our paper  packaging services segment is uniquely positioned as a fully integrated producer of containerboard 
van leer industrial packaging acquisition in march  we acquired royal packaging industries van leer nv  a dutch company  huhtamaki holdings do brasil ltda  a brazilian company  van leer france holding sas  a french company  van leer containers  inc  a united states company  and american flange manufacturing co  inc  a united states company  which are collectively referred to as van leer industrial packaging 
we acquired van leer industrial packaging for million less the amount of certain of its debt and other obligations million that were assumed by us as of the closing date 
van leer industrial packaging was a worldwide provider of industrial packaging and components  including steel  fibre and plastic drums  intermediate bulk containers  closure systems for industrial packaging products and polycarbonate water bottles 
in connection with the van leer industrial packaging acquisition  we acquired a interest in socer embalagens  lda 
and a interest in balmer lawrie van leer 
socer embalagens  lda 
reconditions used drums at its facility in portugal and resells them to customers 
balmer lawrie van leer manufactures closure systems for industrial packaging products and plastic drums at its two facilities in india 
the results of the operations of van leer industrial packaging are included in the consolidated financial statements for eight months of and for the entire years in and  but are not included in the consolidated financial statements for the first four months of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements  in accordance with these principles  require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe that the consistent application of these policies enables us to provide readers 
table of contents of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our results of operations and financial condition 
the following are the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for accounts receivable we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in addition  we recognize allowances for bad debts based on the length of time receivables are past due with allowance percentages  based on our historical experiences  applied on a graduated scale relative to the age of the receivable amounts 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected bad debt experience or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
inventory reserves reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
we continuously evaluate the adequacy of these reserves and make adjustments to these reserves as required 
net assets held for sale net assets held for sale represent land  buildings and land improvements less accumulated depreciation for locations that have been closed 
we record net assets held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is based on the estimated proceeds from the sale of the facility utilizing recent buy offers  market comparables and or data obtained from our commercial real estate broker 
our estimate as to fair value is regularly reviewed and subject to changes in the commercial real estate markets and our continuing evaluation as to the facility s acceptable sale price 
properties  plants and equipment depreciation on properties  plants and equipment is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets 
we own timber properties in the southeastern united states and in canada 
with respect to our united states timber properties  which consisted of approximately  acres at october   depletion expense is computed on the basis of cost and the estimated recoverable timber acquired 
our land costs are maintained by tract 
merchantable timber costs are maintained by five product classes  pine sawtimber  pine chip n saw  pine pulpwood  hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood  within a depletion block  with each depletion block based upon a geographic district or subdistrict 
currently  we have twelve depletion blocks 
these same depletion blocks are used for pre merchantable timber costs 
each year  we estimate the volume of our merchantable timber for the five product classes by each depletion block 
these estimates are based on the current state in the growth cycle and not on quantities to be available in future years 
our estimates do not include costs to be incurred in the future 
we then project these volumes to the end of the year 
upon acquisition of a new timberland tract  we record separate amounts for land  merchantable timber and pre merchantable timber allocated as a percentage of the values being purchased 
these acquisition volumes and costs acquired during the year are added to the totals for each product class within the appropriate depletion block s 
the total of the beginning  one year growth and acquisition volumes are divided by the total undepleted historical cost to arrive at a depletion rate  which is then used for the current year 
as timber is sold  we multiply the volumes sold by the depletion rate for the current year to arrive at the depletion cost 
our canadian timberlands  which consisted of approximately  acres at october   did not have any depletion expense since they are not actively managed at this time 
we believe that the lives and methods of determining depreciation and depletion are reasonable  however  using other lives and methods could provide materially different results 
restructuring reserves restructuring reserves are determined in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance  including sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
restructuring reserves recorded in connection with existing and acquired companies are further discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and postretirement benefit expenses are determined by our actuaries using assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and health care cost trend rates 
further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions is contained in notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the results would be different using other assumptions 

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate  taxes payable and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect current tax rates in our domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and our best estimate of the ultimate outcome of ongoing and potential future tax audits 
valuation allowances are established where expected future taxable income does not support the realization of the deferred tax assets 
environmental cleanup costs we expense environmental expenditures related to existing conditions caused by past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernable 
expenditures that extend the life of the related property  or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  are capitalized 
environmental expenses were million  million and in  and  respectively  and environmental cash expenditures were million  and million in  and  respectively 
our reserves for environmental liabilities at october  amounted to million  which included a reserve of million related to our facility in lier  belgium and million for asserted and unasserted environmental litigation  claims and or assessments at several manufacturing sites and other locations where we believe the outcome of such matters will be unfavorable to us 
the environmental exposures for those sites included in the million reserve were not individually significant 
the reserve for the lier  belgium site is based on environmental studies that have been conducted at this location 
the lier  belgium site is being monitored by the public flemish waste company pfwc  which is the belgian body for waste control 
pfwc must approve all remediation efforts that are undertaken by us at this site 
we anticipate that cash expenditures in future periods for remediation costs at identified sites will be made over an extended period of time 
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures  actual costs may vary from those estimated at october  our exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material 
although environmental remediation could have a material effect on results of operations if a series of adverse developments occur in a particular quarter or fiscal year  we believe that the chance of a series of adverse developments occurring in the same quarter or fiscal year is remote 
future information and developments will require us to continually reassess the expected impact of these environmental matters 
contingencies various lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us  including those pertaining to environmental  product liability  and safety and health matters 
we are continually consulting legal counsel and evaluating requirements to reserve for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
while the amounts claimed may be substantial  the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist 
based on the facts currently available  we believe the disposition of matters that are pending will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically reviewed for impairment as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the costs of acquired intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of to years 
our policy is to periodically review other intangible assets subject to amortization and other long lived assets based upon the evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant adverse event or change in the environment in which the business operates  or if the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest would become less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period such determination is made based on the fair value of the related assets 
other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in this item under forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results below 
actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
results of operations historically  revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results due to various economic and other factors 
our year to year comparisons have been affected by corrchoice s redemption of the outstanding shares of its minority shareholders during  which allows us to consolidate corrchoice s operations with ours  and our acquisition of van leer industrial packaging on march   which significantly expanded our operations 
the non gaap financial measure of operating profit  before restructuring charges and timberland gains  is used throughout the following discussion of our results of operations except with respect to the segment discussions for industrial packaging services and paper  packaging services  where timberland gains is not applicable 
operating profit  before restructuring charges and timberland gains  is equal to gaap operating profit plus restructuring charges less timberland gains 
we use operating profit  before restructuring charges and timberland gains  because we believe that this measure provides a better indication of the company s operational performance than the corresponding gaap measure because it excludes restructuring charges  which are not representative of ongoing operations  and timberland gains  which are volatile from period to period  and it provides a more stable platform on which to compare our historical performance

the operating profit  before restructuring charges and timberland gains  benefited from the inclusion of corrchoice s results for the entire fiscal year 
the restructuring charges were attributable to the execution of our performance improvement plan that was initiated in march segment review industrial packaging services the industrial packaging services segment had an increase in net sales of million  or  in as compared to this change was due to an increase of million in net sales outside of north america including million in europe  partially offset by a decrease of million in north america 
increased pricing for this segment s products in response to higher raw material costs  especially for steel and resin  contributed to the increase in net sales 
net sales outside of north america also benefited from an improvement in sales volumes and currency exchange rates in europe 
the decrease in north american sales was primarily due to lower sales volumes in steel and fibre drums resulting from decreased demand in the markets served

table of contents for this increase relate to an improvement in sales and lower selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  partially offset by a decline in the gross profit margin 
sg a expenses were lower than the prior year primarily due to realized benefits from our performance improvement plan and lower amortization expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets

paper  packaging services the paper  packaging services segment had an increase in net sales of million  or  in as compared to this increase in net sales was primarily due to the inclusion of corrchoice s net sales for the entire fiscal year million  partially offset by lower sales volumes  lower average selling prices for containerboard of approximately  and the elimination of sales from our containerboard operations to corrchoice in gaap operating profit was million for compared with million for operating profit  before restructuring charges of million  was million for as compared to operating profit  before restructuring charges of million  of million for operating profit  before restructuring charges  increased due to the inclusion of corrchoice for the entire fiscal year and a reduction in sg a expenses  on a comparable structure basis  largely due to realized benefits from our performance improvement plan 
the decline in gross profit margin for this segment resulted from lower sales volumes  without a corresponding reduction in fixed costs  in our containerboard operations 
timber the timber segment had a decrease in net sales of million  or  for as compared to while timber sales are subject to fluctuations  we seek to maintain a consistent cutting schedule  within the limits of market and weather conditions

other income statement changes cost of products sold the cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in the cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  primarily increased as a result of higher raw material steel and resin and energy costs  partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses 
lower selling prices and volume levels  without a corresponding reduction in fixed costs  in the containerboard operations of the paper  packaging services segment and lower timber segment sales  which have a low cost associated with them  also had a negative impact on our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses decreased to million of net sales in as compared to million of net sales in the decline in sg a expenses was primarily attributable to the implementation of the performance improvement plan approximately million and the elimination of amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets million 
these reductions were partially offset by the inclusion of sg a expenses for corrchoice million and the negative impact of foreign currency translation million 
restructuring charges on march   we initiated a performance improvement plan  which is expected to enhance long term organic sales growth and productivity  and achieve permanent cost reductions 
as part of the performance improvement plan  we have closed seven company owned plants four in the industrial packaging services segment and three in the paper  packaging services segment 
six of the plants were located in north america and one was located in australia 
in addition  corporate and administrative staff reductions have been made throughout the world 
as a result of the performance improvement plan  during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting of million in employee separation costs  million in asset impairments and million in other costs 
an additional million in restructuring costs are expected to be incurred in a total of approximately  employees have been or will be terminated in connection with the performance improvement plan  of which have been terminated as of october  upon completion of the performance improvement plan  we believe that annual contributions to earnings from these actions will be approximately million

in addition  the results were impacted by higher employee benefit costs and certain charges related to our organizational improvement initiatives and ongoing reorganization activities 
restructuring charges during  we approved a plan to consolidate some of our locations in order to eliminate duplicate facilities caused by the van leer industrial packaging acquisition and improve operating efficiencies and capabilities 
the plan was the result of an in depth study to determine whether certain locations  either existing or newly acquired  should be closed and the sales and manufacturing volume associated with such plants relocated to a different facility 
six existing company owned plastic drum and steel drum plants were closed 
these plants were located in north america 
in addition  certain redundant administrative functions were eliminated 
as a result of this plan  we recognized restructuring charges of million  consisting of million in employee separation costs and a million loss on disposal of equipment and facilities 
we also recognized an additional million in restructuring charges during  primarily as a result of the finalization of this plan

we have approved future capital expenditures of approximately million to million through october  these expenditures are primarily to replace and improve equipment 
balance sheet changes the increases in trade accounts receivable  inventories and properties  plants and equipment  and the decrease in investment in affiliates were primarily due to the consolidation of corrchoice in and the effects of non united states currency translation 
net assets held for sale decreased due to the sale of facilities  partially offset by additional closures  during goodwill increased due to the corrchoice transaction and the acquisition of a small steel drum company in europe 
the increase in accounts payable was due mostly to the timing of payments made to our suppliers and the effects of non united states currency translation 
restructuring reserves increased as a result of activities related to the performance improvement plan 
borrowing arrangements million amended and restated senior secured credit agreement on august   we and certain non united states subsidiaries entered into a million amended and restated senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders 
the amended and restated senior secured credit agreement originally provided for a million term loan and a million revolving multicurrency credit facility 
the revolving multicurrency credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes  and has been permanently reduced to million 
interest is based on either a london interbank offered rate libor or an alternative base rate that resets periodically plus a calculated margin amount 
as of october   there was a total of million outstanding under the amended and restated senior secured credit agreement 
the amended and restated senior secured credit agreement contains certain covenants  which include financial covenants that require us to maintain a certain leverage ratio  a minimum coverage of interest expense and fixed charges  and a minimum net worth 
at october   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the terms of the amended and restated senior secured credit agreement limit our ability to make restricted payments  which include dividends and purchases  redemptions and acquisitions of equity interests 
the repayment of this facility is secured by a first lien on substantially all of the personal property and certain of the real property of greif and its united states subsidiaries and  in part  by the capital stock of the non united states borrowers and any intercompany notes payable to them

table of contents have required principal payments prior to maturity on august  as of october   there was a total of million outstanding under the senior subordinated notes 
the increase in the balance as compared to the proceeds originally received was primarily due to the recording of gains on fair value hedges we have in place to hedge interest rate risk 
the indenture pursuant to which the senior subordinated notes were issued contains certain covenants 
at october   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the terms of the senior subordinated notes also limit our ability to make restricted payments  which include dividends and purchases  redemptions and acquisitions of equity interests 
trade accounts receivable credit facility on october   we entered into a five year  up to million credit facility with an affiliate of a bank in connection with the securitization of certain of our trade accounts receivable 
the facility is secured by certain of our trade accounts receivable and bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a margin or other agreed upon rate 
we also pay a commitment fee 
proceeds received in the initial transaction of million were primarily utilized to repay indebtedness under our amended and restated senior secured credit agreement 
we can terminate this facility at any time upon days prior written notice 
in connection with this transaction  we established greif receivables funding llc  which is included in our consolidated financial statements 
this entity purchases and services our trade accounts receivable that are subject to this credit facility 
the trade accounts receivable credit facility provides that in the event we breach any of our financial covenants under the amended and restated senior secured credit agreement  and the majority of the lenders thereunder consent to a waiver thereof  but the provider of the trade accounts receivable credit facility does not consent to any such waiver  then we must within days of providing notice of the breach pay all amounts outstanding under the trade accounts receivable credit facility

effects of inflation the effects of inflation did not have a material impact on our operations during  or recent accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision of interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
application of this interpretation is required for variable interest entities or special purpose entities for periods ending after december  for all other types of entities  application is required for periods ending after march  the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results statements contained in this form k or any other reports or documents prepared by us may be forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our operating results to differ materially from those projected 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our actual financial performance 
changes in general economic or business conditions 
our customers generally consist of other manufacturers and suppliers who purchase our industrial packaging products and containerboard and related corrugated products for their own containment and shipping purposes 
because we supply a cross section of industries  such as chemicals  food products  petroleum products  pharmaceuticals and metal products  and have operations in many countries  demand for our industrial packaging products and containerboard and related corrugated products has historically corresponded to changes in general economic and business conditions of the industries and countries in which we operate 
accordingly  our financial performance is substantially dependent upon the general economic conditions existing in these industries and countries  and any prolonged or substantial economic downturn could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
currency exchange and political risk 
we have operations in over countries 
as a result of our non united states operations  we are subject to certain risks which could disrupt our 
table of contents operations or force us to incur unanticipated costs 
our operating performance is affected by devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates by translations into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes of the assets and liabilities of our non united states operations conducted in local currencies  and gains or losses from non united states operations conducted in currencies other than their functional currency 
we are subject to various other risks associated with operating in non united states countries  such as the following political  social and economic instability  war  civil disturbance or acts of terrorism  taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation  changes in government policies and regulations  imposition of limitations on conversions of non united states currencies into united states dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by non united states subsidiaries  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non united states subsidiaries  hyperinflation in certain non united states countries  and impositions or increase of investment and other restrictions or requirements by non united states governments 
competition 
our business of manufacturing and selling industrial packaging products  containerboard and corrugated products is highly competitive 
the most important competitive factors are price  quality and service 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have significantly greater financial resources 
changes in industry demands 
industry demand for containerboard in the united states has declined in recent years causing competitive pricing pressures in the containerboard market which has negatively impacted our financial performance 
we compete in industries which are capital intensive  which generally leads to continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs 
as a result  changes in industry demands  including industry over capacity  may cause substantial price competition and  in turn  negatively impact our financial performance 
continuing consolidation of customer base for industrial packaging  containerboard and corrugated products 
over the last few years  many of our large industrial packaging  containerboard and corrugated products customers have acquired  or been acquired by  companies with similar or complementary product lines 
this consolidation has increased the concentration of our largest customers  and resulted in increased pricing pressures from our customers 
the continuing consolidation of our customer base may negatively impact our financial performance 
raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages 
the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are steel  resins  pulpwood  old corrugated containers for recycling  and containerboard  which we purchase in highly competitive  price sensitive markets 
these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality 
some of these materials have been  and in the future may be  in short supply 
however  we have not recently experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining our principal raw materials 
we do not have long term supply contracts or hedging arrangements in place for obtaining our principal raw materials 
the cost of producing our products is sensitive to the price of energy 
energy prices  in particular oil and natural gas  have increased in recent years  with a corresponding effect on our production costs 
environmental and health and safety matters  product liability claims 
we must comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding federal  state  local and non united states environmental matters  such as air and water quality and waste disposal 
we must also comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding safety and health matters 
the failure to materially comply with such rules and regulations could adversely affect our operations 
furthermore  litigation or claims against us with respect to such matters could adversely affect our financial performance 
we may also become subject to product liability claims which could adversely affect us 
work stoppages 
we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a significant number of our employees are represented by unions 
we have experienced work stoppages and strikes in the past  and there may be work stoppages and strikes in the future 
any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal manufacturing facilities could have a negative impact on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
risks associated with acquisitions 
during the past several years we have invested a substantial amount of capital in acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the failure to retain key employees and contracts and the inability to integrate businesses without material disruption 
in addition  other companies in our industries have similar acquisition strategies 
there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our operations  that competition for acquisitions will not intensify or that we will be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions 
in addition  the costs of unsuccessful acquisition efforts may adversely affect our financial performance 
risks of property loss 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire and extended coverage insurance on most of our facilities  with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
however  there are certain types of losses  such as losses resulting from wars  acts of terrorism  or natural disasters  that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose capital invested in 
table of contents that property  as well as the anticipated future revenues derived from the manufacturing activities conducted at that property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
any such loss would adversely impact our business  results of operations or financial condition 
timber and timberland sales 
we have a significant inventory of standing timber and timberland 
the frequency and volume of sales of timber and timberland will have an effect on our financial performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk related to our financial instruments that include borrowings under our amended and restated senior secured credit agreement  proceeds from our senior subordinated notes and trade accounts receivable credit facility  and interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million as of october  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements have been entered into to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates and changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the amended and restated senior secured credit agreement  senior subordinated notes and trade accounts receivable credit facility  the table presents scheduled amortizations of principal and the current weighted average interest rate by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents annual amortizations of notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
under the swap agreements  we receive interest quarterly from the counterparties and pay interest quarterly to the counterparties 
the fair values of the existing amended and restated senior secured credit agreement  senior subordinated notes and trade accounts receivable credit facility are based on current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturity 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements has been determined based upon the current market settlement prices of comparable contracts 
financial instruments dollars in millions expected maturity date after total fair value amended and restated senior secured credit agreement scheduled amortizations average interest rate senior subordinated notes scheduled amortizations average interest rate trade accounts receivable credit facility scheduled amortizations average interest rate interest rate swaps scheduled amortizations average pay rate average receive rate variable rate specified is based on libor or an alternative base rate plus a calculated margin at october  the rates presented are not intended to project our expectations for the future 
the average pay rate is based upon the fixed rates we were scheduled to pay at october   along with additional agreements where we pay libor plus a margin 
the rates presented are not intended to project our expectations for the future 
the average receive rate is based upon the libor we were scheduled to receive at october   along with additional agreements where we receive a fixed rate of 
the rates presented are not intended to project our expectations for the future 

table of contents based on a sensitivity analysis performed by the counterparties at october   a basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the swap agreements by million resulting in a liability of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a fair value liability of million 
foreign currency risk as a result of our non united states operations  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the geographic presence of our operations mitigates this exposure to some degree 
additionally  our transaction exposure is somewhat limited because we produce and sell a majority of our products within each country in which we operate 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain short term intercompany loan balances among our non united states businesses 
at october   we had contracts outstanding of million 
the fair value of these contracts at october  resulted in a loss of million 
each of these contracts hedges the exposure of the euro against the fluctuation of various other currencies 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the euro against these other currencies indicates that if the euro uniformly weakened by against all of the hedged currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million to a net gain of million 
conversely  if the euro uniformly strengthened by against all of the hedged currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would increase by million to a net loss of million 
any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a non united states currency 
commodity price risk our operating profit is potentially affected to a significant degree by fluctuations in the cost of our raw materials and energy see forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results included in item of this form k 
we do not have long term supply contracts or hedging arrangements in place for obtaining our principal raw materials 
in general  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices
