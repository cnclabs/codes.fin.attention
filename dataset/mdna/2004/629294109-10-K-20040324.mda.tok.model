item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about the company and our industry 
these forward looking statements are usually accompanied by words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described in this section under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
overview during and  we completed the divestiture of certain non strategic assets 
these divestitures included the november sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard and the july sale of the neurosciences business unit to integra 
these sales provided aggregate cash proceeds of approximately million  of which approximately million was used in to repay outstanding subordinated debt 
these divestitures strengthened our balance sheet  providing the financial and operational flexibility to pursue the emerging opportunity of treating cardiac sources of stroke and to evaluate other potential opportunities  such as the treatment of migraines  with our proprietary cardioseal and starflex catheter based implant technologies 
our revenues were primarily derived from sales of our cardioseal and starflex products in the us and europe and the commencement of royalties earned from bard pursuant to agreements related to the november sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard 
cardioseal and starflex product sales increased by approximately from to  and we currently expect an approximate increase from to the bard royalties  which apply to its worldwide sales of snf and rnf products  are reported net of certain royalties which we pay to the original inventor 
bard received fda regulatory approval for commercial sales and use of its rnf product as of december  as a result  future royalties earned on rnf product sales could increase significantly  dependent upon continued market acceptance and penetration 
we continue to earn royalties from bsc in connection with the exclusive license of our stent technology 
we believe that future royalties earned from bsc will remain flat or decline from levels 
we currently do not anticipate any other material sources of revenues in in  we launched our clinical trial  closure i  to compare our starflex cardiac septal repair implant with current medical therapy in stroke prevention 
closure i is a  patient  prospective  randomized  multi center trial  for which we received complete ide approval from the fda in june during the second half of  we initiated site selection  site initiation and the process of patient enrollment 
at december   nearly three quarters of the closure i clinical sites have completed the irb process and approximately two thirds of those sites have completed the initiation process allowing them to begin patient enrollment 
although the initial rate of enrollment has been disappointing  we are encouraged by the level of commitment shown by our clinical centers and currently expect that the enrollment phase of closure i will be completed by mid we currently expect that total costs for closure i will be approximately million through completion of the trial and submission to the fda  which is currently expected to be in of this total  approximately million was incurred during and we currently project costs in the range of million  largely dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
as a result of the ongoing costs of closure i  we do not expect to be profitable in we ended with million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  providing the company with what we believe is the financial strength and flexibility to complete closure i and to continue to invest in additional research and development programs  regulatory activities and commercial sales efforts  including potential geographical expansion to the asia pacific region 
another area of significant interest that we expect to investigate is the potential role of pfo closure in the treatment of certain migraine patients 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  we use our judgment in making certain assumptions and estimates 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sabs a  b and sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we use judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we require receipt of official purchases orders for all customer orders for our products 
prior to fulfillment of a customer order  we review that customer s account history and outstanding balances to determine if we believe that collectibility of the order value is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment unless customer purchase orders specifically designate that title to the products transfers upon receipt 
products sold to distributors  which account for approximately of our product sales in  are not subject to a right of return for unsold product 
we recognize royalty income as it is earned in accordance with relevant contract provisions 
where applicable  we report royalty income in our financial statements net of corresponding royalty obligations to third parties 
accounts receivable reserves we provide allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing these allowances  we make assumptions with respect to the future collectibility of our receivable balances 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality  primarily its payment history  as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances  the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook and the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  we determine the probability of customer default  the appropriateness of our current reserve balance and the need to record a charge or credit to operating expense to increase or decrease our reserves level 
the amount of reserves level for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of these factors 
if our assumptions are incorrect  or if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  we may need to make additional allowances 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as we record the related revenues 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
inventories as a manufacturer of leading edge medical devices  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
in such an event  we would need to take a charge against earnings upon making such a determination 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when we believe that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
the assumptions we use in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case any provision required for excess or obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted 
if we determine that our inventory is overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of that determination and such recognition could have a significant impact on our reported operating results 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or installment sales  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not probable  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance  or increase this allowance in a period  we must include a provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   due to uncertainties relating to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or if we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our reported operating results 
the net deferred tax asset at december  of  which is net of the million valuation allowance  is included in prepaid expense and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these legal proceedings  we periodically review estimates of potential costs that we may incur in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
we develop these estimates in consultation with outside counsel and they are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we do not currently believe that any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
expenses associated with clinical trial during the second quarter ended june   we received full ide approval from the fda for  and commenced  closure i 
including contracts with third party providers  agreements with participating clinical sites and internal clinical department costs  we currently expect total costs for closure i to be approximately million through completion of the trial and submission to the fda  which is currently expected to be in of this amount  we incurred costs of approximately million in and we currently project costs in the range of million  largely dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
our judgment is required in determining methodologies used to recognize various costs 
we will expense certain costs as patients are enrolled or upon the occurrence of other specific events during the clinical trial 
we will expense certain other estimated costs  principally related to project management and data analysis  ratably over the estimated period in which the related services will be provided 
additional starflex products manufactured to accommodate the expected requirements of closure i are included in inventory because they are saleable units with alternative use outside of the trial 
these units will be expensed as a cost of closure i as they are implanted 
all expenses related to closure i are included in research and development in our consolidated statements of operations

revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands of dollars product sales cardioseal and starflex north america europe vena cava filter other total product sales net royalty income bard bsc total net royalty income total revenues cardioseal and starflex product sales increased by approximately million  or  in compared to we believe that north american product sales  which increased by from to  benefited from continued growing awareness within the medical community that closing a pfo in certain stroke patients offers an alternative to drug therapy 
additionally  we believe that north american product sales may have been negatively impacted by the combination of closure i and competing trials and commercial sales efforts 
european sales increased by approximately from to  although the strengthening of the euro accounted for approximately  or  of this increase 
european sales have been positively impacted by our increased investments in that region since the second half of direct sales personnel have more than doubled to a total of eight at the end of compared to three at the end of european sales represented approximately and of total cardioseal and starflex product sales in and  respectively 
management currently anticipates approximately growth in cardioseal and starflex product sales in compared to  with european sales projected to approximate of the total 
it is uncertain if  and to what extent  our anticipated acceleration of closure i patient enrollment in will affect the level of north american sales 
continued strengthening or weakening of the euro against the us dollar will have a favorable or unfavorable impact  respectively  on the trend of european product sales 
there were no vena cava filter product sales in in connection with the sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard  we completed  as of june  our transitional manufacturing agreement under which we had continued to sell vena cava filter products to bard 
the substantial increase in net royalty income for the year ended december  was directly attributable to the commencement of royalties from bard on its sales of vena cava filter products see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bard royalties  which were recorded net of royalties payable to the original inventor of these products  were approximately million for the year ended december  a substantial majority of the bard royalties related to sales of its rnf product  for which it received fda regulatory for commercial sale and use as of december  royalties from bsc in connection with its exclusive license of our stent technology were approximately  for the year ended december  compared to royalties and manufacturing cost sharing incentives totaling approximately  for the prior year 
although we believe that royalties earned from bard will increase in the future  that result is largely dependent upon continued market acceptance and penetration of their new generation rnf product 
we currently anticipate that future royalties earned from bsc will remain flat or decline compared to levels 
cost of product sales 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales for the year ended december  was largely attributable to completion of vena cava filter product sales during  which products historically had a higher cost as a percentage of product sales than our cardioseal and starflex products 
this decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales for the year ended december  was partially offset by a increase in the cardioseal and starflex royalty rate  effective in february  and the impact of proportionately higher international sales  which have a lower average selling price than us sales 
included in cost of product sales were royalty expenses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we currently expect cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be approximately in  primarily as a result of higher projected international sales as a percentage of total sales and the higher unit manufacturing cost of our rts product  which was launched in europe during the second half of research and development 
the approximately million increase in research and development expense in compared to was directly related to the launch of our pfo ide clinical trial 
closure i costs of approximately million for the year ended december  were partially offset by cost reductions related to the substantial completion during of the rts development project  the winding down of older clinical trials and the purchase of pfo study data used in the design of the closure i trial 
we continued to invest heavily to protect and expand our intellectual property positions  having filed in excess of utility and provisional patent applications in compared to in we currently expect research and development expense to increase by more than compared to  primarily attributable to an estimated million of costs for closure i 
as a result of the recent execution of certain third party contracts and the expected effects of the extended duration of closure i  we have increased our current estimate of total closure i costs to approximately million through the end of the clinical trial and submission to the fda  currently expected to occur in in addition to third party contracts  closure i costs include the personnel and operating expense of our clinical department and the cost of starflex products implanted 
research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues is expected to be approximately in general and administrative 
general and administrative expense was essentially unchanged from to increases in stock based compensation associated with our stock option re pricing  higher insurance premiums and the commencement of annual retainer fees for outside directors were largely offset by decreases in audit fees related to the mandated re audits performed in  lower corporate legal fees and reduced travel costs  primarily related to the period prior to the july sale of the neurosciences business unit 
general and administrative expense is expected to increase by less than in compared to  primarily related to anticipated insurance premium increases and professional fees necessary to comply with increased corporate governance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
selling and marketing 
the increase in selling and marketing expense in compared to was primarily attributable to our european investments  including additional personnel and associated costs related to the doubling of headcount during the second half of  increased awareness marketing programs in that region and the effect of increased product sales on commission costs 
in addition  the strengthening of the euro throughout had the effect of increasing reported international costs  primarily denominated in euros  by approximately  these cost increases were partially offset by reduced us selling and marketing costs  principally related to travel and marketing programs 
we currently expect selling and marketing expense to increase by approximately in compared to  primarily related to the establishment of a more formalized product management function and anticipated costs to initiate geographical expansion into the asia pacific region 
settlement of litigation 
during the year ended december   we incurred a charge of approximately million in connection with the settlement of an arbitration proceeding with bte 
the charge consisted of a  settlement payment to bte plus legal costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of product line 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain on sale of product line of million related to the achievement of certain performance and delivery milestones in connection with our sale of assets comprising the vena cava filter product line to bard on november  the million gain consisted of i million resulting from the transfer of manufacturing responsibilities to bard as of september   which occurred following the completion of the transitional manufacturing agreement under which we continued to manufacture vena cava filter products for bard through june  and ii million upon the receipt by bard of fda regulatory approval for the commercial sale and use of its recovery filter see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was primarily attributable to a reduction in weighted average interest rates earned  partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest bearing assets 
the increased assets were primarily attributable to the proceeds from our sale of the neurosciences business unit and the contingent consideration received in connection with the sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard 
at december   approximately million of interest bearing funds remain invested in us government agency debt securities  with a scheduled maturity of april an additional million of interest bearing funds are invested in an institutional money market fund  earning approximately per annum based upon the daily rate at december  average interest bearing deposits during are expected to decrease as a result of the significant ongoing costs of closure i 
as a result  we currently expect interest income to decrease by approximately  or  compared to net interest income recorded in fiscal  assuming interest rates remain the same 
income tax provision 
our income tax provision in of  or approximately of loss before income taxes  compares to approximately million  or of income before income taxes from continuing operations  in the significant decrease in our tax provision compared to was directly attributable to an approximately million reduction in income loss from operations 
this reduction consisted primarily of the million gain from sale of product line in in connection with our sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard  the settlement of litigation charge of approximately million and approximately million of closure i costs associated with the commencement of that clinical trial 
the tax provision was primarily attributable to the million of taxable income recognized upon receipt of the final bard milestone payment in january  which was recognized for financial statement purposes in  partially offset by approximately million of remaining tax loss carryforwards for which tax benefit had not been previously provided  and operating losses incurred in the current provision of approximately  has been partially offset by a  deferred tax benefit attributable to the projected carryback of expected operating losses 
we currently expect to incur operating losses in  primarily due to the projected million cost associated with closure i 
accordingly  we expect a minimal tax provision for the year ending december  net gain from discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   net gain from discontinued operations was approximately million  which consisted primarily of a  pre tax loss on the sale of our neurosciences business unit in july and a tax benefit of approximately million attributable to the utilization of prior years losses  for which tax benefit had not been previously provided for in our financial statements 
these un benefited losses were largely attributable to approximately million of asset impairment charges in fiscal and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands of dollars product sales cardioseal and starflex north america europe vena cava filter other total product sales net royalty income bard bsc total net royalty income total revenues cardioseal and starflex product sales increased by approximately million  or  in compared to we believe that this increase resulted primarily from i the growing awareness within the medical community that closing a pfo in certain stroke patients offers an alternative to ongoing drug therapy  ii the granting of a pma by the fda in december for the vsd indication  and iii an increase in our direct sales headcount during fiscal from to the approximate million decrease in vena cava filter product sales was primarily attributable to completion of our transitional manufacturing agreement with bard as of june  in connection with our november sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard 
net royalty income  related to the exclusive license of our stent technology to bsc  included  and  of royalties and  and  of cost sharing payments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  decrease in royalty payments was attributable to reduced bsc sales of the stent products manufactured using our technology 
cost of product sales 
the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was primarily attributable to the completion of the transitional manufacturing agreement with bard as of june  accentuating the historical shift of the product sales mix in favor of our cardioseal and starflex products  which have a lower product cost as a percentage of sales than the vena cava filter products 
included in cost of product sales were royalty expenses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to acquired technologies and technology rights associated with our products 
research and development 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to a combination of increased headcount and related personnel costs  contract product development for ongoing research and development programs related to cardioseal and starflex enhancements and accessories  next generation pfo closure platforms and research into the use of novel materials  and related patent legal costs 
we filed more than patent applications and disclosures during  with a large number in the fourth quarter 
general and administrative 
the decrease in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to decreased legal fees associated with ongoing litigation and general corporate matters and reduced stock based compensation charges associated with our stock option re pricing  partially offset by one time costs of a required re audit of our fiscal year and financial statements 
the sale of our neurosciences business unit  as a discontinued operation  required restatement of our consolidated financial statements and a re issuance of our prior auditor s report 
because our prior auditor  arthur andersen llp  ceased operations  our new auditors had to re audit those years 
selling and marketing 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to i an increase in worldwide headcount from to  including associated increases in benefits and travel costs  ii higher sales commissions related to the increase in cardioseal and starflex products sales  iii increased marketing program costs  and iv european marketing consulting services 
selling and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to approximately in from approximately in gain on sale of product line 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a gain on sale of product line of million and million  respectively 
these gains resulted from the sale of assets comprising our vena cava filter product line to bard on november  in exchange for these assets  we received million at closing and million in january and the right to receive up to an additional million tied to certain performance and delivery milestones 
the gain of million consisted of proceeds of million less costs of approximately million  which consisted of the purchase of royalty and other technology rights from beth israel  deferred revenue estimates related to the transitional manufacturing agreement  accruals for ongoing arbitration proceedings  the net book value of assets sold and legal and other costs of the sale 
the gain of million consisted of i million resulting from the transfer of manufacturing responsibilities to bard as of september   which occurred following the completion of the transitional manufacturing agreement under which we continued to manufacture vena cava filter products for bard through june  and ii million upon the receipt by bard of fda regulatory approval for the commercial sale and use of its recovery vena cava filter see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense was substantially eliminated in as a result of the complete repayment during of our million subordinated debt  principally from the proceeds of the sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard 
interest expense for the year ended december  was attributable to outstanding capital lease obligations  which were paid in full during interest income 
the increase in interest income for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to increases in interest bearing deposits resulting from the million of net proceeds from the sale of the vena cava filter product line in november and january  the million contingent consideration received in september from that transaction and the million proceeds from the sale of the remainder of our neurosciences business unit on july   partially offset by a significant reduction in interest rates from to loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately  for the year ended december  consisted of the write off of the remaining balances of original issue discount and deferred loan costs in connection with the repayment in full of our subordinated debt in november income tax provision 
our income tax provision in of approximately million or of income before income taxes from continuing operations  compared to an income tax provision of approximately million  or of income before income taxes from continuing operations in the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes from continuing operations in was less than what would be expected using the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
income loss from discontinued operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the financial results of the neurosciences business unit  which was sold on july   as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
loss from discontinued operations of approximately  for the year ended december  compared to income from discontinued operations of approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a charge of approximately  recorded in the first quarter of  for a settlement of litigation with elekta  from whom we purchased the original neurosciences business unit in july see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   gain on sale of discontinued operations was approximately million  which consisted of a  pre tax loss on the sale our neurosciences business unit in july and a tax benefit of approximately million attributable to the utilization of prior years losses  for which tax benefit had not been previously provided for in the company s financial statements 
these un benefited losses were largely attributable to approximately million of asset impairment charges in fiscal and there was no gain on sale of discontinued operations for the year ended december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash provided by continuing operations cash used in provided by discontinued operations cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash provided by continuing operations cash provided by continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled  and was comprised of a a net loss of approximately million  b various non cash charges to operations of approximately million  and c net changes in components of working capital of approximately  net cash provided by continuing operations for decreased by approximately million from this decrease was primarily attributable to the following a we received a total of million cash consideration from bard during in connection the sale of the vena cava filter product line  including the first million milestone payment  an increase of million compared to million cash consideration received during  representing the final milestone payment under the bard agreement 
b at december   we had recorded a deferred gain of million relating to the sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard  which consisted of i an estimated million of aggregate price discounts to be applied against invoices due from bard for the sales of vena cava filter products during the transitional manufacturing period  and b an estimated million accrual for costs associated with an ongoing arbitration proceeding related to the sale of the vena cava filter product line 
during  we recorded a million reduction of the deferred gain balance down to zero as we transferred manufacturing capabilities of filter products to bard and settled the arbitration proceeding 
the non cash charges of approximately million in included depreciation of property  plant and equipment  amortization of bond premium related to our investments in us government agency securities  provisions for bad debts and sales returns and stock based compensation principally related to our stock option re pricing in unless we purchase additional marketable securities at a premium  amortization of bond premium will not re occur in the primary elements of the  net change in working capital items in consisted of the following a we received the final million milestone payment from bard in january  which had been recognized as a receivable as of december  b net trade accounts receivable increased by approximately  primarily due to increased product sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of gross trade accounts receivable increased by approximately  or  at december  compared to this increase was less than the approximate  or  increase in fourth quarter product sales compared to that of the prior year as days sales outstanding dso improved to approximately days at the end of compared to approximately days at the end of the prior year 
our european sales increased by approximately in compared to and  although european customers generally are slower payers than us customers  we achieved better dso due to improved collection efforts 
c our inventories increased by approximately  during  primarily in anticipation of closure i patient enrollment requirements  initial stocking levels of the new rts product and also as a result of higher projected sales growth than was realized 
based upon our production plan and expected acceleration of closure i patient enrollment  we currently anticipate that inventory balances will trend downward during d prepaid expenses and other current assets increased during by approximately million 
of this total  approximately  represented fourth quarter royalties due from bard that commenced in as a result of our sale of the filter product line to bard 
the remainder of this increase related primarily to increased annual insurance premiums paid in advance at renewal and increased deposits associated with committed marketing events and capital equipment purchases  partially offset by reduced levels of interest income receivable 
to the extent that increases in bard royalties and insurance renewal premiums are currently anticipated  we expect that the level of prepaid expenses and other current assets will trend upward in e current liabilities increased by approximately  during  primarily related to closure i cost accruals  increased royalty accruals and current income taxes payable  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable and the completion of the re audit of the years ended december  and that was required to reflect our sale of the neurosciences business unit as a discontinued operation 
we currently expect that closure i costs and accruals will increase substantially during royalty expense accruals are also currently expected to increase  but will be partially offset by the anticipated payment of the last  balloon royalty to cmcc during net cash provided by continuing operations for increased by approximately million compared to this increase was largely attributable to a million increase in cash consideration from bard for the sale of the vena cava filter product line  net of a million reduction of the deferred gain balance down to zero as we transferred manufacturing capabilities of filter products to bard and settled the arbitration proceeding 
cash used in provided by discontinued operations cash used in discontinued operations of approximately  during related to the payment of a judgment against the company related to the termination of a former european employee of the neurosciences business unit 
this compared to cash provided by discontinued operations of approximately million during  which consisted primarily of a million tax benefit attributable to the utilization of losses  not previously benefited for financial statement purposes  in connection with the july sale of our neurosciences business unit 
these losses substantially offset the taxable income recognized in from the sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard 
cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided from investing activities of approximately million in consisted primarily of million proceeds from maturities of us government agency debt instruments 
this compared to cash used from investing activities of approximately million in  which consisted primarily of million of purchases of us government agency debt instruments  offset by million proceeds from the sale of our neurosciences business unit  net of cash balances sold 
purchases of property and equipment for use in our manufacturing  research and development and general and administrative activities amounted to approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased by approximately  from to this decrease was primarily attributable to an approximate  reduction of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp  offset by an approximate  reduction in payment of capital lease obligations  which were repaid in full during net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in represented a net million increase compared to net cash used in financing activities of approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to the repayment in of million of a subordinated note  predominantly from the initial proceeds of our sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard 
additionally  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of espp shares increased by approximately  in compared to and payments of capital lease obligations decreased by approximately  in compared to at december   we had no outstanding debt financing 
primarily as a result of the ongoing costs of closure i  we expect to incur operating losses at least through the total cost of our closure i clinical trial is currently estimated to be approximately million through completion of the trial and submission to the fda  which is currently expected to be in of this amount  approximately million was incurred in and we currently expect to incur approximately million in  largely dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
capital expenditures are projected to total approximately  during  primarily for manufacturing and research and development equipment 
we currently believe that aggregate cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of approximately million at december  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  financing and capital expenditure requirements through at least based upon current projections of closure i costs during  we expect that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will exceed million at the end of we may require additional funds for our research and product development programs  regulatory processes  preclinical and clinical testing  sales and marketing infrastructure and programs and potential licenses and acquisitions 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the level of sales of our products  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments and changes in our existing research  licensing and other relationships and the terms of any collaborative  licensing and other similar arrangements that we may establish 
we do not currently have any existing line of credit arrangements 
contractual obligations substantially all of our existing operating leases relate to our boston  massachusetts manufacturing  research and development and administrative offices 
the facility leases  which expire in september  include one year renewal option on a majority of this space 
exercise of this option requires written notice to the landlord at any time during the period months prior to the expiration of the lease term 
we are party to various royalty agreements under which we are obligated to pay royalties i to cmcc on commercial sales of our cardioseal and starflex product sales  ii to the original inventor of certain vena cava filter products on sales of those products by bard  and iii to lloyd marks on sales of cardioseal and starflex products to the extent that technology licensed to us is incorporated into these products  subject to a minimum annual royalty of  to maintain exclusivity 
royalty expenses in totaled approximately million and are expected to increase in the future 
in connection with closure i  we have entered into various contractual obligations with third party service providers and the participating clinical sites 
including the internal costs of the company s clinical department and the manufacturing costs of the starflex products to be implanted  total closure i costs are currently estimated to be approximately million through the completion of the trial and submission to the fda  which is currently expected to be in of this total  approximately million of costs were incurred in and we currently project costs in the range of million  largely dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
the ultimate timing and amounts of these obligations are dependent upon various factors  including the timing of patient enrollment and patient monitoring 
under certain agreements  we have the right to terminate  in which case the remaining obligations would be limited to costs incurred as of that date 
the following table summarizes our estimated minimum future contractual commitments at december   excluding royalty and closure i obligations because they are variable and or subject to uncertain timing amounts due in total less than one year years years after years operating leases off balance sheet financing during the year ended december   we have not engaged in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or specific purpose entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin expands upon existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in december  the fasb revised fin fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  for pre existing entities  these requirements must be applied in the first interim reporting period ending after march  the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by the company from time to time 
we may face uncertainties with respect to the execution  cost and ultimate outcome of closure i 
upon receipt of final fda approval  we commenced closure i in june although nearly three quarters of the clinical sites have completed the irb approval process and two thirds of those sites have concluded the initiation process allowing them to begin patient enrollment  the initial rate of patient enrollment has been disappointing 
as a result  and based upon our current estimates  we expect that enrollment of all  patients will be completed by mid we currently estimate the total costs of closure i to be approximately million through completion of the clinical trial and submission to the fda  which is currently expected to be in we have no direct experience conducting a clinical trial of this magnitude 
we cannot be certain that patient enrollment will be completed within our revised time expectation or at all 
we cannot be certain that the projected costs of closure i will not need to be adjusted upwards further 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that we will obtain a pma from the fda based upon the final results of the trial 
if closure i does not result in a pma  we may face uncertainties and or limitations as to the continued growth of revenues of our cardioseal and starflex products  which would impact our ability to be profitable 
circumstances could cause the loss of our hde approval for use of cardioseal in treating pfo patients 
all of our us commercial sales of cardioseal are made pursuant to either a the pma granted by the fda in december covering the vsd indication  or b the hde granted by the fda in february covering the pfo indication 
to the extent that we believe that pfo is the much larger market opportunity  a substantial majority of our u 
s sales are made under the pfo hde 
if the first pma for the pfo indication were to be granted by the fda to one of our competitors  our hde approval for pfo would be deactivated by the fda 
such a loss of our pfo hde would cause a very material reduction in us sales  resulting in significant operating losses based upon our current operational structure 
under these circumstances  and in the absence of substantial sources of new financing  our future prospects would be severely limited  including our ability to complete the closure i clinical trial that is required to apply for a pfo pma 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of one product line 
during and  we completed the divestiture of non strategic businesses through the sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard and the sale of the remainder of the neurosciences business unit to integra 
we derive a substantial portion of our ongoing revenues from sales of our cardioseal and starflex products 
in the united states  the fda limits sales under an hde to  units per year 
as demand for  and costs associated with  these products fluctuates  including the potential impact of our non revenue producing pfo ide clinical trial on product sales  our financial results on a quarterly or annual basis may be significantly impacted 
accordingly  events or circumstances adversely affecting the sales of either of these products will directly and adversely impact our business 
these events or circumstances may include reduced demand for our products  lack of regulatory approvals  product liability claims and or increased competition 
we may face uncertainties with respect to commercialization  product development and market acceptance of our products 
we cannot be certain that our current products  or products currently under development  will achieve or maintain market acceptance 
certain of the medical indications that can be treated by our devices can also be treated by surgery  drugs or other medical devices 
currently  the medical community widely accepts many alternative treatments  and these other treatments have a long history of use 
we cannot be certain that our devices and procedures will be able to replace such established treatments or that either physicians or the medical community  in general  will accept and utilize our devices or any other medical products that we may develop 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop additional products 
even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits  the cost of commercializing that product candidate may be too high to justify development 
in addition  competitors may develop products that are more effective  cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products 
if we are unable to develop additional  commercially viable products  our future prospects will be limited 
we may face challenges in executing our focused business strategy 
in connection with the commercialization of our cardioseal and starflex products  and the recent sales of our vena cava filter product line and our neurosciences business unit  we have focused our business growth strategy to concentrate on the manufacturing  marketing and selling of our cardiac septal repair devices 
our future sales growth and financial results depend almost exclusively upon the growth of sales of this product line 
cardioseal and starflex product sales may not grow as quickly as we expect for various reasons  including  but not limited to  delays in receiving further fda approvals  difficulties in recruiting additional experienced sales and marketing personnel and increased competition 
this focus has placed significant demands on our senior management team and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage and implement our focused business strategy effectively  including by achieving a successful closure i clinical trial  improving our sales and marketing capabilities  continuing to train  motivate and manage our employees  and developing and improving our operational  financial and other internal systems 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and may face intellectual property infringement claims 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications or any future patent applications will result in issued patents  the scope of our patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us  any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by us 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that others have not or will not develop similar products  duplicate any of our products or design around any patents issued  or that may be issued  in the future to us or to our licensors 
whether or not patents are issued to us or to our licensors  others may hold or receive patents which contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by us 
we could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting any patent rights  including those granted by third parties 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our issued us patents  and corresponding foreign patents  expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent 
we have invested in significant new patent applications and we cannot be certain that any of these applications will result in an issued patent to enhance our intellectual property rights 
our limited manufacturing history and the possibility of non compliance with manufacturing regulations raise uncertainties with respect to our ability to commercialize future products 
we have a limited history in manufacturing our products  including our cardioseal and starflex cardiac septal repair devices  and we may face difficulties as the commercialization of our products and the medical device industry changes 
increases in our manufacturing costs  or significant delays in our manufacturing process  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards including  but not limited to  good manufacturing practices and iso standards 
these regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production or purchasing costs and may even prevent us from making or obtaining our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand 
if we or a third party manufacturer change our approved manufacturing process  the fda will require a new approval before that process could be used 
failure to develop our manufacturing capabilities may mean that even if we develop promising new products  we may not be able to produce them profitably  as a result of delays and additional capital investment costs 
we may be unable to successfully grow our product revenues or expand geographically due to limited marketing and sales experience 
our cardiac septal repair implant devices are marketed primarily through our direct sales force 
we have increased our combined us and european sales and marketing organization headcount from to during the two years ended december  due to our relatively new sales staff  and because we have marketed our initial products such as stents and vena cava filters through third parties  we have limited experience marketing our products directly 
we are uncertain that we can successfully expand geographically into asia pacific or other potential markets for our products 
in order to market directly the cardioseal and starflex septal implants and any related products  we will have to continue to develop a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to compete successfully because of intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
existing and future products  therapies  technological approaches and delivery systems will continue to compete directly with our products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  greater research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources and experience and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  new surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current or future procedures that utilize our products 
as a result  any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with development of these products 
an adverse outcome in any litigation we are currently involved in could affect our financial condition 
we are currently involved in the litigation of disputes as described in item legal proceedings 
an adverse outcome in any one of these disputes could result in substantial monetary damages and  therefore  negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
product liability claims  product recalls and uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the testing  marketing and sale of implantable devices and materials carry an inherent risk that users will assert product liability claims against us or our third party distributors 
in these claims  users might allege that their use of our devices had adverse effects on their health 
a product liability claim or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business 
certain of our devices are designed to be used in life threatening situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or death 
although we currently maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that in the future we will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms  or that current insurance or insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against any or all potential claims 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that we will avoid significant product liability claims and the attendant adverse publicity 
any product liability claim  or other claim  with respect to uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
intense industry competition for qualified employees could affect our ability to attract and retain necessary  qualified personnel 
in the medical device field  there is intense competition for qualified personnel and we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
both the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would be detrimental to our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise 
the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business 
as a result of government regulations  we may experience lower sales and earnings 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices intended for commercial distribution are subject to extensive governmental regulations in the united states and abroad 
medical devices generally require pre market clearance or pre market approval prior to commercial distribution 
certain material changes or modifications to medical devices are also subject to regulatory review and clearance or approval 
the regulatory approval process is expensive  uncertain and lengthy 
if granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
in addition  any products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the fda 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our products on a timely basis or at all 
the occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  regulatory approvals or clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  limitations on the intended use of a device imposed as a condition of regulatory approvals or clearances  or our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
in addition  sales of medical device products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face uncertainties with respect to the availability of third party reimbursement 
in the united states  medicare  medicaid and other government insurance programs  as well as private insurance reimbursement programs  greatly affect revenues for suppliers of health care products and services 
such third party payors may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount  if any  of reimbursement which they provide to the physicians and hospitals using our devices  or any other products that we may develop 
if  for any reason  the third party payors decided not to provide reimbursement for our products  this would materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
moreover  mounting concerns about rising health care costs may cause the government or private insurers to implement more restrictive coverage and reimbursement policies in the future 
in the international market  reimbursement by private third party medical insurance providers and by governmental insurers and providers varies from country to country 
in certain countries  our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third party governmental reimbursement 
the significant concentration of ownership of our common stock could limit investors ability to influence corporate actions 
a few of our stockholders  including whitney co 
and related entities  own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of impacting the probability and timing of a change in control of the company 
this could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the company and might otherwise affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
our investments are primarily short term money market accounts that are carried on our books at cost  which approximates fair market value  and us government agency debt instruments that are carried on our books at cost  increased or decreased by unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  respectively  which amounts are recorded as a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
we are subject to market risk in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk is immaterial to the company 
although we have decreased the scope of our international operations following the sale of the neurosciences business unit in july  we continue to denominate certain sales and operating expenses in non us currencies see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
we translate the accounts of our foreign subsidiaries in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
prior to the sale of the neurosciences business unit  the assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries were translated from their local currency into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period  while stockholders equity was translated at historical rates 
we recorded the effects of changes in balance sheet items ie  cumulative foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of consolidated stockholders equity 
the functional currency of our remaining foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar and  accordingly  translation gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue and expense accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate in effect during the period
