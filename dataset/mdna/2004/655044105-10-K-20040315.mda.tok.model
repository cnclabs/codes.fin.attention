item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
noble energy is an independent energy company engaged  directly or through its subsidiaries or various arrangements with other companies  in the exploration  development  production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas 
the company has exploration  exploitation and production operations domestically and internationally 
the domestic areas consist of offshore in the gulf of mexico and california  the gulf coast region louisiana and texas  the mid continent region oklahoma and kansas  and the rocky mountain region colorado  montana  nevada  wyoming and california 
the international areas of operations include argentina  china  ecuador  equatorial guinea  the mediterranean sea israel  the north sea denmark  the netherlands and the united kingdom and vietnam 
the company also markets domestic crude oil and natural gas production through a wholly owned subsidiary  nemi 
the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
executive overview noble energy s principal business strategy is to create shareholder value by generating stable cash flow and production from domestic operations  while generating growth from international projects 
in the us  the company has a substantial onshore and offshore asset base located in established  prolific basins where the company is aggressively pursuing exploration and exploitation opportunities 
offshore  exploration focuses on the deepwater and deep shelf areas of the gulf of mexico 
internationally  the company has built a strong project portfolio and has applied innovative approaches to developing markets for stranded natural gas  including construction of a natural gas fired power plant near machala  ecuador  and liquefied petroleum gas and methanol plants in equatorial guinea 
over the past two years  the company has completed major  capital intensive projects in ecuador  china  israel and the first phase of a two phase project in equatorial guinea 
with these important projects completed  international capital commitments are declining rapidly 
at the same time  the projects are contributing significantly to the company s financial and operating results 
during  noble energy reached several milestones in positioning the company as a major international competitor among independent exploration and production companies  including first production in china occurred in january  initial production began in november from the phase a expansion project in equatorial guinea  facilities were commissioned to begin production of natural gas in israel  with first production in december and first sales in february  and full year of ecuador power plant operations 
domestically  an active onshore drilling program led to several discoveries and new production during offshore  in the deepwater region of the gulf of mexico  the company announced an apparent discovery on the lorien prospect and start of production from the boris field 
in the shelf region of the gulf of mexico  there was new production from the roaring fork field beginning in the fourth quarter 
also during  the company identified and prepared for sale five packages of domestic non core properties 
this divestiture program was intended to reduce costs and streamline the business 
at the close of the year  sales were completed on four of the property packages 
was a year of strong financial performance as well net income for was million  a significant increase over net income of million  net cash provided by operating activities in was million  an increase of million over net cash provided by operating activities of million in  and the company ended the year with a stronger balance sheet total debt was million  net of unamortized discount  at year end  a reduction of million from the previous year 
with s strong financial performance and the decline in international capital commitments  noble energy gained enhanced financial flexibility 
projects in china  ecuador and israel are now complete 
in equatorial guinea  the first phase production is ramping up and the second phase is scheduled for completion by year end the completion of these projects should contribute to increased amounts of free cash flow 
domestic operations have implemented disciplined business processes that have stabilized production 
as a result  noble energy has gained financial and operational flexibility 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
when alternatives exist among various accounting methods  the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts 
the following is a discussion of the company s accounting estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in its application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
reserves all of the reserve data in this form k are estimates 
the company s estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by the company s engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves would also trigger an impairment analysis and could result in an impairment charge 
the sec requested clarification  which the company provided  as to the company s israel and equatorial guinea gas reserves recorded in excess of existing contract amounts 
sec guidelines do not limit reserve bookings only to contracted volumes if it can be demonstrated that there is reasonable certainty that a market exists  which the company believes exists in both of these situations 
the israel gas contract is for a period of years 
the israel gas market  as estimated by the israeli ministry of national infrastructure  from to  is twenty times greater than noble energy s uncontracted net estimated proved reserves 
in equatorial guinea  the gas contract  which runs through  is between the field owners and the methanol plant owners 
noble energy  through its subsidiaries  holds a working interest in the field as well as an interest in the methanol plant 
the company has recorded reserves through the end of the concession s term in noble energy has obtained independent third party engineer reserve estimates for both of these projects 
oil and gas properties the company accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting 
the alternative method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is the full cost method 
under the successful efforts method  costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties are amortized to operations by the unit of production method based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on a property by property basis as estimated by company engineers 
application of the successful efforts method results in the expensing of certain costs including geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals  during the periods the costs are incurred 
under the full cost method  these costs are capitalized as assets and charged to earnings in future periods as a component of dd a expense 
the company believes the successful efforts method is the most appropriate method to use to account for its crude oil and natural gas production activities because during periods of active exploration  this method results in a more conservative measurement of net assets and net income 
if the company had used the full cost method  its financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different 
impairment of oil and gas properties the company assesses proved crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
the company recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property are less than the current net book value 
estimated future cash flows are based on management s expectations for the future and include estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs 
downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs can result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment 
the company recognized million of impairments in  primarily related to a reserve revision on a property in the gulf of mexico after recompletion and remediation activities produced less than expected results 
the company also performs periodic assessments of individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  estimated future commodity prices and operating costs  availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political climate in areas in which the company operates impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions 
in december  the company elected not to pursue any additional exploration efforts in the nam con son basin of vietnam 
as a result  the company wrote off its investment in vietnam 
asset retirement obligation the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and gas properties 
statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a 
at december   the company s balance sheet included a liability for aro of million 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to price risk from changing commodity prices 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in determining types of instruments to be used  production volumes to be hedged  prices at which to hedge and the counterparties and their creditworthiness 
the company accounts for its derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the forecasted transaction is recognized in earnings 
therefore  prior to settlement of the derivative instruments  changes in the fair market value can cause significant increases or decreases in aoci 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value must be reported in the current period  rather than in the period in which the forecasted transaction occurs 
this may result in significant increases or decreases in current period net income 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company s balance sheet includes deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards 
ultimately  realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback carryforward period to absorb future deductible temporary differences or a carryforward 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers all available evidence both positive and negative in determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence 
as a result of management s current assessment  the company maintains a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowances associated with certain foreign loss carryforwards have decreased from million in to million in this change was due to the elimination of the carryforward and offsetting valuation allowance associated with vietnam  the elimination of the valuation allowance associated with israel and the partial elimination of the valuation allowance associated with china 
because of the relatively short carryforward period in china and the lack of a long term fixed price contract  the valuation allowance associated with china was not fully eliminated 
the company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in its reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes will be utilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  the company may determine that the deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be increased or decreased 
such changes would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense 
pension plan the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans 
the actuarial determination of the projected benefit obligation and related benefit expense requires that certain assumptions be made regarding such variables as expected return on plan assets  discount rates  rate of compensation increase  estimated employee turnover rates and retirement dates  lump sum election rates  mortality rate  retiree utilization rates for health care services and health care cost trend rates 
the selection of assumptions requires considerable judgment concerning future events and has a significant impact on the amount of the obligation recorded on the company s balance sheets and on the amount of expense included on the company s statements of operations  as well as on funding 
noble energy bases its determination of the asset return component of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of december   the company had cumulative asset losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the company utilizes the services of an outside actuarial firm to assist in the calculations of the projected benefit obligation and related costs 
the company and its actuaries use historical data and forecasts to determine assumptions 
in selecting the assumption for expected long term rate of return on assets  the company considers the average rate of earnings expected on the funds to be invested to provide for plan benefits 
this includes considering the plan s asset allocation  historical returns on these types of assets  the current economic environment and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan 
it is assumed that the long term asset mix will be consistent with the target asset allocation of percent equity and percent fixed income  with a range of plus or minus percent acceptable degree of variation in the plan s asset allocation 
the discount rate is determined by analyzing the interest rates implicit in current annuity contract prices and available yields on high quality fixed income securities 
by definition  discount rates reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the expected return assumption for is percent and the assumed discount rate for is percent  both of which are the same as liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary cash needs are to fund capital expenditures related to the acquisition  exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties  to repay outstanding borrowings or to pay other contractual commitments  for interest payments on debt  to pay cash dividends on common stock and to fund contributions to the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the company s traditional sources of liquidity are its cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities 
funds may also be generated from occasional sales of non strategic crude oil and natural gas properties 
the company made significant progress during in improving liquidity and financial flexibility 
reduction in international capital commitments due to completion of major capital intensive projects is expected to increase flexibility and liquidity in with these projects completed or nearing completion  international capital commitments are declining rapidly while  at the same time  they are beginning to contribute to the company s financial and operating results 
a million increase in the company s day credit facility will also provide increased liquidity in the company improved its balance sheet leverage during and achieved a reduction in its ratio of debt to book capital defined as the company s total debt plus its equity to percent at december   compared to percent at december  the company reduced total debt by million during the company s current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities was 
at december   compared with 
l at december  the improvement in the current ratio in  as compared to  resulted from increases in year end cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments in current assets which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable  current installments of long term debt and derivative financial instruments in current liabilities 
in  total current assets increased by percent as compared to while total current liabilities increased only percent for the same period 
cash flows operating activities the company reported a million year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increase was driven by an overall production increase of four percent and higher realized commodity prices 
the increase was also impacted by higher distributions from the company s unconsolidated methanol subsidiary and a growing contribution from electricity sales 
the million decrease in  as compared to  was due primarily to lower natural gas prices  partially offset by higher crude oil prices and production volumes 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
the company s investing activities relate primarily to expenditures made for the exploration and development of oil and gas properties and have been decreasing due to declining capital commitments 
during  expenditures were offset by the receipt of million from sales of non core assets 
additionally  the company funded the aspect acquisition in for approximately million  net of million cash acquired and  shares of treasury stock 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ending december  net cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from and repayments of bank debt  repayment of notes payable  the payment of cash dividends and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
also included in financing activities was the repayment of an obligation of million related to treasury stock in the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in as compared to resulted from repayments of bank debt and repayment of the treasury stock obligation in addition to a decrease in bank borrowings 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in as compared to related primarily to a decrease in bank borrowings 
capital expenditures capital expenditures incurred in oil and gas activities  downstream projects  acquisitions  and corporate and other consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands oil and gas mineral interests  equipment and facilities downstream projects aspect acquisition corporate and other total capital expenditures total capital expenditures include seismic  lease rentals and other miscellaneous expenditures  which are expensed through the statements of operations and are not included in capital expenditures from investing activities 
capital expenditures from investing activities consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands capital expenditures aspect acquisition  net of cash acquired total capital expenditures from investing activities capital expenditures do not include expenditures for the methanol plant 
those expenditures are included in cash flows from investing activities investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries 
capital expenditures budget capital expenditures have shown year over year declines of million or percent to and million or percent to 
these decreases in spending are the result of declining capital commitments due to the completion  or near completion  of major capital intensive projects in international locations 
during  the company expended million compared to a budget of million 
the primary reason for the additional capital expenditures was due to the acceleration of the initial costs to begin the phase b expansion in equatorial guinea 
during  the company expended million compared to a budget of million 
the primary additional capital expenditures were for the completion of the gas to power project in ecuador and the continued development of the israel project 
during  the company expended million compared to a budget of million 
the primary additional expenditures in were for the aspect acquisition  which was million and not included in the budget  and the completion of the methanol plant in equatorial guinea  along with the development of the gas to power project in ecuador 
budget the company s capital expenditure budget totals million  a decline of percent compared to actual capital expenditures 
the reduced budget results from the completion of two major international projects  the phase a condensate expansion project in equatorial guinea and the mari b natural gas project in israel 
the capital budget has allocated approximately percent to exploration opportunities and percent to production and development projects 
the budget allocates million  or percent  to domestic spending with approximately two thirds for the offshore division and one third for the onshore division 
of the total domestic capital budget  approximately percent is for exploration and percent is for production and development 
the budget allocates million  or percent  to international expenditures with percent for production and development projects 
noble energy has planned expenditures allocated to regions where the company is most active  including the middle east and africa million  the far east and latin america million and the north sea million 
the company expects that its capital expenditure budget will be funded primarily from cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of its offshore asset package expected to occur during the first half of the company will evaluate its level of capital spending throughout the year based upon drilling results  commodity prices  cash flows from operations and property acquisitions 
acquisitions the company has made no significant acquisitions since when it acquired interests in certain wells located along the texas and louisiana gulf coast and an interest in future drilling prospects from aspect energy for million  net of million cash acquired and  shares of treasury stock 
asset sales the company has sold a number of non strategic crude oil and natural gas properties over the past three years 
proceeds from asset sales totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sales of properties during included reserves of approximately bcfe  or four percent  of year end proved reserves 
sales of properties during included reserves of approximately bcfe 
the company believes the disposition of non strategic properties allows it to concentrate efforts on strategic properties and reduce leverage 
financing activities debt the company s debt totaled million at december   of which million was long term with maturities ranging from to the company s million series a notes  million of the aspect acquisition note and million of israel debt are due during and are classified as short term on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company expects to fund the repayments primarily from a combination of operating cash flows  draw downs of the credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of non core properties 
the company has a million credit agreement due november  the credit facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rate is based upon a eurodollar rate plus a range of to basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating 
at december   there was million borrowed against this credit agreement leaving million of unused borrowing capacity 
the company entered into a new million day credit agreement effective november   which represents an increase in capacity of million over the previous facility 
the credit agreement is with certain commercial lending institutions and exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rate is based upon a eurodollar rate plus a range of to basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating 
at december   there was million borrowed against this credit agreement leaving million of unused borrowing capacity 
the agreement has a maturity date of october  for the revolving commitment and a final maturity date of october  for the term commitment that includes any balance remaining after the revolving commitment matures 
during  a subsidiary of the company borrowed a total of million from certain commercial lending institutions 
the interest rate on the borrowing is london interbank offering rate libor plus an effective range of to basis points depending upon credit rating and the borrowing is for a term of five years 
proceeds were used to reduce amounts due under the million credit agreement 
financial covenants on both the million and million credit facilities include the following a the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and exploration expense ebitdax to interest expense for any consecutive period of four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter may not be less than to  b the total debt to capitalization ratio  expressed as a percentage  may not exceed percent at any time  and c the total asset value of the company s restricted entities may not be less than million at any time 
the company occasionally enters into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included a payable of million related to an outstanding interest rate lock 
the company made cash interest payments of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
dividends the company paid quarterly cash dividends of four cents per share from through the third quarter in october  the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of five cents per common share 
this payment represents an increase of one cent per share  or percent  over the company s previous quarterly payment of four cents per share 
total dividends paid during increased 
million  or seven percent  over due to the higher dividend rate 
the amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend on earnings  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
stock repurchase program in accordance with a board approved stock repurchase forward program  one of the company s banks purchased  shares of company stock on the open market during and during the second quarter of  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
as a result  the company recorded an additional  shares of treasury stock at a cost of million and an obligation of million 
in december  the company paid the obligation in full 
exercise of stock options the company received million  million and million from the exercise of stock options during  and  respectively 
proceeds received by the company from the exercise of stock options fluctuate primarily based on the price at which the company s common stock trades on the new york stock exchange in relation to the exercise price of the options issued 
during and  the company s stock reached higher sales prices than during  resulting in the exercise of more options and more proceeds to the company 
in addition  during  stock options were exercised at a higher average price than during and other contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans the company made contributions of million to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans during  million during and million during the company expects to make cash contributions of million to its pension plan during the decrease in the expected contribution for is due primarily to the higher actual return on pension plan assets experienced during and an expectation of a continued positive return on plan assets during due to the recovery of market conditions 
during  the actual return on plan assets was a positive million  while the returns in and were a negative million and a negative million  respectively 
the value of the plan assets has tended to follow market performance 
the expected return assumption for is percent and the assumed discount rate for is percent  both of which are the same as a one percent decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in an increase in benefit expense of 
million in federal income taxes the company made cash payments for federal income taxes of million during and million during during  the company received a federal tax refund of million 
the refund related to large estimated tax payments made during the first half of followed by a period of declining commodity prices  which resulted in lower taxable income by the end of contingencies during  the company paid million in settlement of two legal proceedings conducted in the ordinary course of business

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities the company  from time to time  uses various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations 
such instruments include fixed price hedges  variable to fixed price swaps  costless collars and other contractual arrangements 
although these derivative instruments expose the company to credit risk  the company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties and believes that losses from nonperformance are unlikely to occur 
hedging gains and losses related to the company s crude oil and natural gas production are recorded in oil and gas sales and royalties 
during  and  the company included a million reduction of sales and increased sales of million and million  respectively  related to its cash flow hedges in oil and gas sales and royalties 
costs and expenses crude oil and natural gas operations expense from continuing operations increased million in compared to the increase in crude oil and natural gas operating expense was due to several factors  including new operations in china  increased production and the startup of phase a in equatorial guinea  new production in the gulf of mexico and higher production taxes

interest expense interest rates have consistently decreased over the past three years while company borrowings have steadily increased  peaking early in throughout the remainder of the year  the company steadily paid down its debt resulting in a year over year decrease of million in interest expense at december  compared to the same period in interest expense totaled million at december   which was a million increase over interest expense of million at december  the company believes that interest rates will remain stable in and expects to continue paying down its debt throughout the year  which should result in lower interest expense at year end pension expense the company recognized net periodic benefit cost related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
this expense included an expected return on pension plan assets of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company is exposed to credit risk and takes reasonable steps to protect itself from nonperformance by its debtors  but is not able to predict sudden changes in its debtors creditworthiness 
the company periodically assesses its provision for bad debt allowance 
the company had allowances for doubtful accounts as of december  and of million and million  respectively 
the increase in the allowance in compared to was due primarily to an allowance of million related to financial derivative contracts with one of the company s counterparties 
income taxes income tax expense associated with continuing operations increased to million in from million in primarily from the increase in income 
however  the effective income tax rate decreased to percent in from percent in during  the company s income from international operations increased over  but represented a smaller proportion of the company s total income 
some of the countries in which the international operations were conducted have a higher statutory income tax rate than the united states 
also impacting the effective rate in was the realization of approximately million of tax benefits for certain prior year costs incurred in israel and vietnam 
the million decrease in income tax expense for was due to a million decrease in income from continuing operations offset by an increase in the effective income tax rate 
the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations increased to percent in from percent in during  a larger proportion of the company s income was from international operations 
some of the countries in which international operations are conducted have a higher statutory income tax rate than the united states 
in the netherlands  the company had significantly higher income in compared to due primarily to a full year of production from the hanze field 
in equatorial guinea  the company had higher income in compared to from a full year of the methanol plant s operations and the impact of nondeductible interest expense 
in the united kingdom  the company had higher income in compared to and was impacted by an increase in the country s corporate tax rate 
in ecuador  the company had no income prior to discontinued operations pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company s consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the operations and assets of the properties being sold as discontinued operations 
the net income from discontinued operations was classified on the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations  net of tax 
during  the company identified five domestic property packages for disposition 
bids have now been received on all five packages 
during  property sales closed on four of the five packages  with the remaining property package expected to close during the first half of total pretax proceeds on all five packages  before closing adjustments  are expected to be in excess of million 
the company recorded a loss  net of tax  related to discontinued operations of million in included in the discontinued operations loss was a million million  net of tax non cash write down to market value for certain of the five property packages 
the company has reclassified the results of operations associated with the five property packages for and to discontinued operations 
this reclassification did not have an effect on net income as previously reported for and as a result of the reclassification  oil and gas sales and royalties are lower  as well as the associated oil and gas operations and dd a expense 
summarized results of discontinued operations are as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues oil and gas sales and royalties costs and expenses write down to market value and realized loss oil and gas operations depreciation  depletion and amortization income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from discontinued operations key statistics daily production liquids bbl natural gas mcf average realized price liquids bbl natural gas mcf the long term debt of the company is recorded at the consolidated level and is not reflected by each component 
thus  the company has not allocated interest expense to the discontinued operations 
future trends the company expects crude oil and natural gas production from continuing operations to increase in and compared to assuming commodity prices stay in the range experienced in the increased production in is expected primarily from ramp up of the phase a expansion of the alba field in equatorial guinea and the initial sales from the mari b field  offshore israel 
the increase in is expected primarily from the continued expansion of markets in israel and the phase b expansion of the lpg plant in equatorial guinea 
the company recently set its capital expenditures budget at approximately million 
such expenditures are planned to be funded principally through internally generated cash flows 
the company believes that it has the capital structure to take advantage of strategic acquisitions  as they become available  through internally generated cash flows or available lines of credit and other borrowing opportunities 
management believes that the company is well positioned with its balanced reserves of crude oil and natural gas and downstream projects 
the uncertainty of commodity prices continues to affect the crude oil  natural gas and methanol industries 
the company cannot predict the extent to which its revenues will be affected by inflation  government regulation or changing prices 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
this sab revises or rescinds portions of the revenue recognition interpretive guidance included in the sab codification to make it consistent with current authoritative accounting guidance 
the principal revisions relate to revenue recognition guidance no longer necessary due to developments in us generally accepted accounting principles 
the pronouncement had no impact on the company s historical financial statements 
during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued several new pronouncements sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities that fall within the scope of sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   with certain exceptions  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of this statement had no impact on the company s historical financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
during the second quarter of  the company adopted sfas no 
as a result  the company recorded an additional million shares of treasury stock at a cost of million and an obligation of million 
sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
 and  revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans and requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
most of the requirements are effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the company has made additional disclosures in its financial statements in compliance with sfas no 
fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
special provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied interpretation no 
prior to issuance of this revised interpretation 
otherwise  application of this interpretation is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the provisions of this interpretation would be applied if the company were to acquire an interest in a variable interest entity 
the adoption of this statement had no impact on the company s historical financial statements 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act became law 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare 
fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  allows deferral of the recognition of the act s provisions until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued 
the company has elected to defer recognition of the effects of the act in the accounting for and disclosure of its postretirement benefit plan in accordance with the staff position 
authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is pending 
final guidance could require the company to change previously reported information 
the company does not believe that the effects of the act will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
accounting for costs associated with mineral rights during  a reporting issue arose regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
the eitf has added the treatment of oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda  which may result in a change in how noble energy classifies these assets 
historically  the company has included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  net of amortization  the company most likely would be required to reclassify certain amounts out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible assets line item 
the company s cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with existing successful efforts accounting rules 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  noble energy would be required to reclassify the estimated amounts as follows december  intangible assets in thousands proved leasehold acquisition costs unproved leasehold acquisition costs total leasehold acquisition costs less accumulated depletion net leasehold acquisition costs further  the company does not believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on compliance with covenants under the company s debt agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash flow hedges the company  from time to time  uses various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations 
such instruments include fixed price hedges  variable to fixed price swaps  costless collars and other contractual arrangements 
although these derivative instruments expose the company to credit risk  the company takes reasonable steps to protect itself from nonperformance by its counterparties including periodic assessment of necessary provisions for bad debt allowance  however  the company is not able to predict sudden changes in its counterparties creditworthiness 
the company accounts for its derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and has elected to designate its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges 
derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reflected at fair value on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are reported in aoci until the forecasted transaction occurs 
gains and losses from such derivatives related to the company s crude oil and natural gas production and which qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in oil and gas sales and royalties on the company s consolidated statements of operations upon sale of the associated products 
hedge effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly based on total changes in the derivative instrument s fair value 
any ineffective portion of the derivative instrument s change in fair value is recognized immediately in other income 
during  and  the company entered into various crude oil and natural gas fixed price swaps  costless collars and costless collar combinations related to its crude oil and natural gas production 
the tables below depict the various transactions 
natural gas hedge mmbtupd fixed price range floor price range ceiling price range percent of daily production gain loss per mcf crude oil hedge bpd fixed price floor price range ceiling price range percent of daily production gain loss per bbl during  and  the company included a reduction of million and gains of million and million  respectively  related to its cash flow hedges in oil and gas sales and royalties 
during  and  no gains or losses were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment 
during  the company recorded 
million of ineffectiveness related to its cash flow hedges 
no ineffectiveness was recorded for and in  the company only had financial derivatives in the fourth quarter 
of these fourth quarter derivatives   mmbtu of natural gas per day was terminated early 
amounts in aoci were reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings  resulting in an increase in oil and gas sales and royalties of million during the fourth quarter of as a result  the company recognized an additional 
per mmbtu on the  mmbtu of natural gas per day in as of december   the company had entered into costless collars related to its natural gas and crude oil production to support the company s investment program as follows natural gas crude oil production period mmbtupd price per mmbtu floor ceiling bopd price per bbl floor ceiling q q q q the contracts entitle the company floating price payor to receive settlement from the counterparty fixed price payor for each calculation period in amounts  if any  by which the settlement price for the last scheduled nymex trading day applicable for each calculation period is less than the floor price 
the company would pay the counterparty if the settlement price for the last scheduled nymex trading day applicable for each calculation period is more than the ceiling price 
the amount payable by the floating price payor  if the floating price is above the ceiling price  is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess  if any  of the floating price over the ceiling price in respect of each calculation period 
the amount payable by the fixed price payor  if the floating price is below the floor price  is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess  if any  of the floor price over the floating price in respect of each calculation period 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december  and  the balance in aoci included net deferred losses of million and million  respectively  related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the net deferred losses are net of deferred income tax benefit of million and million  respectively 
if commodity prices were to stay the same as they were at december   approximately million of deferred losses related to the fair values of crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments included in aoci at december  would be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months as the forecasted transactions occur  and would be recorded as a reduction in oil and gas sales and royalties 
any actual increase or decrease in revenues will depend upon market conditions over the period during which the forecasted transactions occur 
all forecasted transactions currently being hedged with crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur by december other derivative instruments in addition to the derivative instruments pertaining to the company s production as described above  nemi  from time to time  employs various derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to natural gas price risk 
most of the purchases made by nemi are on an index basis  however  purchasers in the markets in which nemi sells often require fixed or nymex related pricing 
nemi may use a derivative to convert the fixed or nymex sale to an index basis thereby determining the margin and minimizing the risk of price volatility 
nemi records gains and losses on derivative instruments using mark to market accounting 
under this accounting method  the changes in the market value of outstanding financial instruments are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change 
nemi recorded a loss of 
million  a gain of 
million and a loss of 
million in gmp proceeds during  and  respectively  related to derivative instruments 
receivables payables related to crude oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included a receivable of million and a payable of million related to crude oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included a receivable of million and a payable of million related to crude oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments 
during  the company had contracts with enron north america corporation ena that resulted in gains of million net of allowance included in gmp proceeds 
in addition  as of december   the company had nymex related transactions with ena totaling contracts with a mark to market receivable value of million 
interest rate lock the company occasionally enters into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk 
changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate locks used as cash flow hedges are reported in aoci  to the extent the hedge is effective  until the forecasted transaction occurs  at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included a payable of million related to an outstanding interest rate lock 
the amount of deferred loss included in aoci at december  was million  net of tax 
the company has a million credit agreement that exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rate is based upon a eurodollar rate plus a range of to basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating 
at december   there was million borrowed against this credit agreement with an interest rate of percent and a maturity date of november  a percent change in the december  interest rate on this million would result in a change in interest expense of 
million 
the company has a new million credit agreement that exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rate is based upon a eurodollar rate plus a range of to basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating 
at december   there was million borrowed against this credit agreement with an interest rate of percent and a final maturity date of october  a percent change in the december  interest rate on this million would result in a change in interest expense of 
million 
all other significant company long term debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
the company does not enter into foreign currency derivatives 
the us dollar is considered the primary currency for each of the company s international operations 
transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are translated into us dollars and recorded in the financial statements 
translation gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and the company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis 
such gains or losses are included in other income on the statements of operations 
however  certain sales transactions are concluded in foreign currencies and the company  therefore  is exposed to potential risk of loss based on fluctuation in exchange rates from time to time 
cautionary statement for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of and other federal securities laws general 
noble energy is including the following discussion to generally inform its existing and potential security holders of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect the company and to take advantage of the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements afforded under federal securities laws 
from time to time  the company s management or persons acting on management s behalf make forward looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about the company 
these statements may include  but are not limited to  projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and the company s future income  crude oil and natural gas production  crude oil and natural gas reserves and reserve replacement and capital spending 
forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate  project  predict  believe  expect  anticipate  plan  goal or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
sometimes the company will specifically describe a statement as being a forward looking statement 
in addition  except for the historical information contained in this form k  the matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements 
these statements by their nature are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions and will be influenced by various factors 
should any of the assumptions underlying a forward looking statement prove incorrect  actual results could vary materially 
noble energy believes the factors discussed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made herein or elsewhere by the company or on its behalf 
the factors listed below are not necessarily all of the important factors 
unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of forward looking statements 
noble energy does not intend to update its description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises 
the company advises its stockholders that they should be aware that important factors not described below could affect the accuracy of our forward looking statements  and use caution and common sense when analyzing our forward looking statements in this document or elsewhere 
all of such forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
volatility and level of hydrocarbon commodity prices 
historically  natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile 
these prices rise and fall based on changes in market supply and demand fundamentals and changes in the political  regulatory and economic climates and other factors that affect commodities markets generally and are outside of noble energy s control 
some of noble energy s projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of natural gas and crude oil 
these price assumptions are used for planning purposes 
the company expects its assumptions may change over time and that actual prices in the future may differ from our estimates 
any substantial or extended change in the actual prices of natural gas and or crude oil could have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations  the quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that the company can economically produce  the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to its properties  and the company s ability to fund its capital program 
production rates and reserve replacement 
projecting future rates of crude oil and natural gas production is inherently imprecise 
producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs generally have declining production rates 
production rates depend on a number of factors  including geological  geophysical and engineering issues  weather  production curtailments or restrictions  prices for natural gas and crude oil  available transportation capacity  market demand and the political  economic and regulatory climates 
another factor affecting production rates is noble energy s ability to replace depleting reservoirs with new reserves through exploration success or acquisitions 
exploration success is difficult to predict  particularly over the short term  where results can vary widely from year to year 
moreover  the company s ability to replace reserves over an extended period depends not only on the total volumes found  but also on the cost of finding and developing such reserves 
depending on the general price environment for natural gas and crude oil  noble energy s finding and development costs may not justify the use of resources to explore for and develop such reserves 
reserve estimates 
noble energy s forward looking statements are predicated  in part  on the company s estimates of its crude oil and natural gas reserves 
all of the reserve data in this form k or otherwise made by or on behalf of the company are estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves 
projecting future rates of production and timing of future development expenditures is also inexact 
many factors beyond the company s control affect these estimates 
in addition  the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
therefore  estimates made by different engineers may vary 
the results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may also require a revision of that estimate  and these revisions may be material 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
laws and regulations 
noble energy s forward looking statements are generally based on the assumption that the legal and regulatory environments will remain stable 
changes in the legal and or regulatory environments could have a material effect on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
noble energy s ability to economically produce and sell crude oil  natural gas  methanol and power is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors  including federal  state and local laws and regulations in the us and laws and regulations of foreign nations  affecting crude oil and natural gas production  taxes applicable to the company and or its production  the amount of crude oil and natural gas available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities  and the marketing of competitive fuels 
the company s operations are also subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations in the us and laws and regulations of foreign nations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
noble energy s forward looking statements are generally based upon the expectation that the company will not be required  in the near future  to expend cash to comply with environmental laws and regulations that are material in relation to its total capital expenditures program 
however  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  the company is unable to accurately predict the ultimate financial impact of compliance 
drilling and operating risks 
noble energy s drilling operations are subject to various risks common in the industry  including cratering  explosions  fires and uncontrollable flows of crude oil  natural gas or well fluids 
in addition  a substantial amount of the company s operations are currently offshore  domestically and internationally  and subject to the additional hazards of marine operations  such as loop currents  capsizing  collision  and damage or loss from severe weather 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents and adverse weather conditions 
competition 
competition in the industry is intense 
noble energy actively competes for reserve acquisitions and exploration leases and licenses  for the labor and equipment required to operate and develop crude oil and natural gas properties and in the gathering and marketing of natural gas  crude oil  methanol and power 
the company s competitors include the major integrated oil companies  independent crude oil and natural gas concerns  individual producers  natural gas and crude oil marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers  many of whom have greater financial resources than the company
