overview visx  a delaware corporation organized in  is a worldwide leader in the design and development of proprietary technologies and systems for laser vision correction 
our primary operations are in santa clara  ca 
our products require fda approval in the united states and comparable regulatory agency approvals in other countries 
our approvals in the united states and key markets worldwide for laser vision correction cover most types of refractive vision disorders including nearsightedness  farsightedness  and astigmatism 
in certain key international markets  our customvue procedure is also approved for all of these refractive vision disorders 
in may  we obtained fda approval for our new customvue procedure for nearsightedness and astigmatism 
we sell products worldwide and generate the majority of our revenues and cash through licensing fees charged for the performance of laser vision correction procedures using the visx star system 
the license fee charged for a particular procedure depends on whether the procedure is performed in the united states or internationally  and the type of procedure involved 
in the united states  we have always charged a license fee for our standard procedure and charge a license fee for our customvue procedure that is more than twice the amount charged for our standard procedure 
additionally  we charge a standard price of per procedure for the treatment cards 
internationally  for standard procedures we only charge a small fee per procedure for the treatment card 
for customvue procedures we charge a significantly larger fee per procedure 
we believe our customvue procedure  which requires use of a visx wavescan system  represents a new standard in laser vision correction 
it enables doctors to identify  measure  and correct imperfections in a patient s eye much more precisely than ever before  thus creating the potential for patients to experience better vision than is possible with glasses or contact lenses 
we believe we have the largest installed base of laser vision correction systems  with over systems in place worldwide 
we also believe we maintained at least share for procedures performed in the united states in according to marketscope  we have held at least market share since licensing revenues for procedures comprise the majority of our revenue and profit  and are predominantly derived from license fees from our united states customers 
this has been especially true in recent years as the laser vision correction market has matured and the demand for new hardware systems and upgrades to those systems has declined 
licensing revenues grew in compared with and generated approximately gross margin on the sale of procedures 
we evaluate this aspect of our business by tracking the following the number of procedures sold  
table of contents trends in procedures sales  including conversion rates from standard to customvue procedures  market share for visx and its competitors  and penetration of the overall laser vision correction market 
any increase in license fee revenue that results from either an increase in the amount charged for a particular procedure or from an increase in overall procedure volume directly impacts our net income 
as a result  our management team is focused on activities that will i accelerate the market s acceptance of  and conversion to  our customvue procedure  ii enable visx to maintain or gain market share  and iii increase the penetration of the laser vision correction market in general 
progress on any one of these fronts offers the potential for growth in our licensing revenue 
we manage our expenses closely and plan to generate cash from our ongoing business operations in historically  our primary non operating use of cash has been to repurchase shares of our stock 
we bought million shares of stock in and intend to repurchase additional shares in cash flow permitting  we will also continue to investigate areas where we can expand our presence in the refractive surgery market 
this could result in using cash for the acquisition of technology or a company 
our capital expenditures have been in the range of million to million per year in the past five years 
we do not expect a near term change in this level of expenditures 
we have no long term debt 
looking to  our business is highly leveraged on procedure volume  and increasingly  the conversion to customvue procedures 
a number of factors  the most material of which are set forth below  could impact our success in and beyond market acceptance of laser vision correction 
increased acceptance of laser vision correction by both doctors and patients in the united states and key international markets is essential for our continued growth 
laser vision correction has penetrated less than of the eligible united states population  and our profitability and continued growth will be largely dependent on increasing levels of market acceptance and procedure growth  especially with regard to our higher priced customvue procedure 
we expect that ongoing technical advances  such as the customvue procedure  will enhance the quality of patients vision which may also increase consumer confidence in laser vision correction surgery 
our ability to expand the refractive vision disorder range approved by the fda for treatment with the visx star system 
we continue to expand the list of fda approved refractive vision disorder range that can be treated with visx star systems 
as the number of fda approved indications increases  so does the pool of eligible laser vision correction candidates and the potential for increased procedure growth and licensing revenue 
our competition 
competition in the laser vision correction market is intense 
many of our competitors have greater resources and a stronger international market presence 
as a result  we compete aggressively to obtain this business and experience low gross margins on the sale of equipment 
the united states economy 
because we have always charged a license fee for procedures sold in the united states  the united states remains  by far  our most significant market for licensing revenue 
economic conditions in the united states therefore impact our licensing revenue more than global economic conditions 
industry experts have tracked procedure volume in the united states against economic indicators such as consumer confidence 
they have noted a correlation between consumer confidence and the number of laser vision correction procedures performed per quarter 
we believe that a rebound in the united states economy and increases in consumer confidence could provide renewed support for the laser vision correction market in the united states 
alternatively  a decline in economic conditions in the united states could result in a decline in the number of laser vision correction procedures performed 
we believe that our revenue and profit will improve in as a result of various factors including continued conversion to the customvue procedure maintenance  at least  of our united states market share and improvements in the united states economy 
we plan for an increase in operating expenses of to with a goal of increasing our operating margins to greater than of sales 
we expect to continue to generate cash from operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial information as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenues license and other revenues system revenues service and parts revenues total revenues costs and expenses cost of license and other revenues cost of system revenues cost of service and parts revenues selling  general and administrative research  development and regulatory total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income litigation settlement other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to year ended december  change s license and other revenues percent of revenues system revenues percent of revenues service and parts revenues percent of revenues total license and other revenues license and other revenues grew  or million  in compared with  reflecting primarily the conversion to our new customvue procedure by our united states customers 
we introduced the customvue procedure in june in the united states and have sold the product for more than double the price of our standard procedure 
in the united states  customvue procedures represented of the procedure orders in the third quarter and of the procedure volume in the fourth quarter 
in the united states for the full year  of our procedure orders were customvue procedures 
our total united states procedure volume for the year grew by over the prior year and also contributed modestly to the increase in license and other revenue 
as the economy improved in the second half of  the procedure growth 
table of contents was more significant 
it grew in the second half of compared with the second half of we believe this increase represents the direct impact of favorable economic conditions on interest in laser vision correction surgery 
based on economists projections for a more favorable economic environment in and our belief that customers will continue to adopt our customvue product  we believe that our procedure volume and conversion levels to customvue procedures from standard procedures will increase in we cannot be certain of this projection since there is uncertainty in the economic outlook and the decision to have laser vision correction surgery is influenced by many factors 
the procedure is elective and generally not covered by medical insurance  therefore it competes with many types of purchases for consumers discretionary spending 
perceptions about safety and effectiveness of the procedure are additional considerations 
the lack of long term follow up studies of the procedure combined with media coverage of selected unfavorable outcomes may contribute to uncertainty and delay by some potential consumers 
as such  we cannot accurately predict when  or to what extent  these anticipated changes in the economy and technology will impact our license and other revenues 
system revenues system revenues comprise sales and leases of the following equipment visx star system  upgrades to the visx star system  and wavescan systems 
system revenues were negatively impacted by less upgrade revenue  which resulted because of our united states customers had already upgraded their visx star s tm to the star s system by the end of  fewer visx star system sales due to the continued weak economic environment  competitive pricing pressures for excimer lasers  and in asia pacific  political tensions in korea and the outbreak of sars in this was offset by the increase in sales of wavescan systems which increased to units compared with units in the prior year  enables over of our united states customers to perform customvue procedures that generate higher revenue and profit per procedure 
the market for laser systems remains competitive 
we experienced lower per unit pricing on laser sales in compared with we believe that we have maintained our system market share in the united states and in our key international markets 
marketscope estimates that visx is the leader in the worldwide market with approximately of worldwide laser placements 
in  we believe there will be no significant growth in revenues from laser system revenues and that the sale of wavescan systems will be less than in  since most of our customers have already purchased a wavescan system 

table of contents service and parts revenues service and parts revenues in were million lower than in this was primarily the result of a new service plan which effectively reduces the price charged for service contracts on laser systems with lower than average procedure volume 
year ended december  change s cost of license and other revenues percent of related revenues cost of system revenues percent of related revenues cost of service and parts revenues percent of related revenues selling  general and administrative percent of total revenues research  development and regulatory percent of total revenues cost of license and other revenues cost of license and other revenues increased slightly in compared with the increase was due to slightly higher procedure sales that resulted in additional licensing support in we experienced a gross profit margin on license and other revenues of approximately in and in we anticipate similar margins for this product in cost of system revenues cost of system revenues increased million  due to the increase in wavescan system sales 
this was partially offset by fewer visx star system sales and fewer sales of upgrades 
our gross profit margin on system revenues declined in from because we sold fewer system upgrades and we earned less revenue on average per unit sold 
we believe that our gross profit margin on system revenues for will remain low 
cost of service and parts revenues cost of service and parts revenues decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the decrease was due to fewer requirements for service on a larger installed base of stable products in the united states 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses declined by approximately million to million in compared with the change reflects primarily the following items legal expenses declined million in from we settled a lawsuit against nidek in the first quarter of which was the main reason for the million reduction in gross legal expenses in compared with offsetting gross legal expenses  we received insurance reimbursements of million and million in and  respectively  related to legal expenses we incurred in connection with the nidek lawsuits  an increase in marketing and sales expenses of million to promote customvue 

table of contents in  our current plan for operations includes a modest increase in marketing and sales expenses as we continue to promote our customvue procedure  administrative spending similar to levels  and an increase in legal expenses  because such expenses will not be offset by insurance reimbursement in we believe these factors will result in an increase of to in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
research and development and regulatory expenses our research and development and regulatory expenses in remained similar to levels 
we focused our efforts on next generation technologies and developments for laser vision correction  including laser platforms such as our star s tm laser system  eye diagnostic units such as our wavescan system  new methods for correcting vision disorders including further indications such as hyperopia and high myopia for our customvue treatment  continued research and clinical trials for treatment of presbyopia  and continued funding of early stage research at stanford university for future treatments for age related macular degeneration 
in  we anticipate that our research and development and regulatory expenses will increase slightly compared to our expenditures in interest and other income interest income declined in from as a result of lower average cash balances due to use of cash for the repurchase of our stock and payment of the nidek settlement  and lower average yields on our portfolio of cash and investments compared to due to market declines in interest rates 
income tax provision our effective tax rate increased in from due principally to lower research and development tax credits 
results of operations compared to year ended december  change s license and other revenues percent of revenues system revenues percent of revenues service and parts revenues percent of revenues total 
table of contents license and other revenues license and other revenue in was million lower than in mainly due to a decline in the volume of us procedures for which visx earned procedure fees 
we believe the economic recession was the principal cause of the decline in our procedure volume and the united states laser vision correction market as a whole in from system revenues system revenues in were million lower than in due to a decline in sales of visx star systems and visx star system upgrade revenue  which was partially offset by an increase in the sale of wavescan systems 
system revenues were negatively impacted by visx star system revenues revenue declined million from to million due to the recession both united states and worldwide and aggressive pricing tactics by competitors  and laser upgrade revenue decreased million from to million because a majority of our us customers upgraded their visx star s systems to the new visx star s model during since we began installing the visx star s upgrade in the fourth quarter of  we had upgraded approximately of the visx star s lasers based in the united states by the end of this was offset by the increase in sales of wavescan systems which increased million from to million as we continued to extend our rollout of this product 
service and parts revenues service and parts revenues in were million lower than in mainly due to a new service plan which effectively reduced the price charged for service contracts on laser systems with lower than average procedure volume

this was partially offset by higher cost of visx star system and wavescan system revenue  based on increased wavescan system sales in compared with cost of service and parts revenues cost of service and parts revenues increased million to million in from million in the increase was due to higher costs to service a larger installed base of systems 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million in compared with the net increase was due to  a million increase in selling and marketing expenses primarily related to additional marketing research and a million increase attributable to an impairment charge related to our investment in medjet inc these increases were partially offset by  a million reduction in provision for doubtful accounts receivables in over our policy is to provide allowances against receivables based on our assessment of our customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
as a result of this analysis  our provision for doubtful accounts receivable was million in as compared to million in  and a decrease in legal expenses in research and development and regulatory expenses our research and development and regulatory expenses decreased million 
we continued to focus on next generation technologies and developments for laser vision correction 
these included laser platforms such as our star s laser system  eye diagnostic units such as our wavescan system  and new methods for correcting vision disorders including our customvue treatment and early research and clinical trials on treatments for presbyopia 
we also continued funding early stage research at stanford university for future treatments for age related macular degeneration 
interest and other income our average balance of cash invested in interest bearing securities was lower in than in due to cash used to repurchase our stock 
additionally  as market interest rates decreased throughout the year the average yield on our portfolio of cash and investments was lower in compared to accordingly  interest income declined in from income tax provision our effective tax rate decreased in from due higher tax benefits associated with our sales outside the united states and research and development

typically we experience an increase in procedure related revenue in the united states market in the first quarter of each calendar year 
we attribute this increase to consumers using the annual renewal of funding under the internal revenue service code section pre tax medical savings plan to purchase laser vision correction for 
table of contents themselves 
laser vision correction is not generally covered by medical insurance 
our equipment and procedure revenues tend to decline in the summer 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with our accounting policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
we believe our most critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments include the following revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is described in note to the financial statements 
we are also required to ensure that collectibility is reasonably assured before we recognize revenue 
accordingly  we evaluate our customers for credit worthiness and only recognize revenue if we believe that we have reasonable assurance that amounts will be collected 
where we are unable to assess with reasonable assurance that amounts will be collected  we defer revenue recognition until the payments are received 
this is occasionally the case with customers who have recently set themselves up in business and typically where the customer is thinly capitalized 
accounts receivable at the end of each accounting period  we estimate the reserve necessary for accounts receivable that will ultimately not be collected from customers 
to develop this estimate  we review all receivables and identify those accounts with problems 
for these problem accounts  we estimate individual  specific reserves based on our analysis of the payment history  operations and finances of each account 
for all other accounts  we review historical bad debt trends  general and industry specific economic trends  customer concentrations  and current payment patterns to estimate the reserve necessary to provide for payment defaults that cannot be specifically identified but can be expected with reasonable probability to occur in the future 
we face two particular challenges in estimating these reserves concentration of credit with certain large customers and the potential for significant change in the overall health of the national economies in the markets we serve 
unexpected deterioration in the health of either a large customer or a national economy could lead to a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december   and  as a percentage of gross accounts receivable was  and respectively 
at december   a one percentage point deviation in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of approximately million 
inventories adjustments to the carrying value of inventory for excess and obsolete items are based  in part  on our estimate of demand over the following months 
this estimate  though based on our historical experience and consideration of other relevant factors  such as the current economic climate  is subject to some uncertainty 
amounts charged to income for excess and obsolete inventory for the years ending december   and as a percentage of total revenues in  and  were all less than 
to date  our estimates have been materially accurate and subject to any major changes in our business model  our operating environment or the economy  and taking consideration of the ongoing development of our technology  we do not expect either our methodology or the accuracy of our estimates to change significantly in the future 
legal contingencies at the end of each accounting period  we review all outstanding legal matters 
if we believe it is probable that we will incur a loss as a result of the resolution of a legal matter and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss  we accrue our best estimate of the potential loss 
it is very difficult to predict the future results of complex legal matters  although historically  the amounts we have paid out have been materially similar to the amounts that we have accrued 
new developments in legal matters can cause changes in previous estimates and result in significant changes in loss 
table of contents accruals 
currently we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal actions against us that we believe could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  we could in the future be subject to litigation claims that could cause us to incur significant expenses and put our business  financial position  and results of operations at material risk 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital were as follows change change cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments working capital stockholders equity our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments consist principally of money market funds  and bonds issued by the united states government  government sponsored enterprises and corporations 
all of our short term investments are classified as available for sale under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the securities are carried at fair market value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses are recognized when realized on the consolidated statements of operations 
cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were million at december   a decline of million compared with december  it was impacted principally by stock repurchases of million  positive cash flow from operating activities of million  and proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs generating million 
operating activities generated million in cash in compared with million provided in in we generated million of cash from net income plus non cash related expenses million  used cash to pay million included in accrued liabilities as of december  to nidek for settlement of antitrust and related claims  increased accounts receivables balances due primarily to higher sales levels in the latter half of the year  and engaged in a higher number of operating lease arrangements with our physicians whereby we retain ownership of the system and receive revenue for the system generally over several years on a per procedure program 
as such  we hold these leased systems in property  plant and equipment and amortize them to cost of system revenues over the term of the lease 
new placements of equipment under these types of leases negatively impacted our cash by approximately million in  and 
utilized prepaid taxes and deferred tax assets to reduce income tax payments otherwise due during by million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  down from million provided in the principal movements in cash provided by investing activities were due to the investment in  and maturity of short term investments 
this was partially offset in by a payment of million for acquired patents and technology assets from perfect vision optische gerate gmbh 
capital expenditure decreased by million to million 
cash used in financing activities was million in  up from million used in the principal factor that contributed to the cash used in financing activities was the cash used to repurchase million shares and million shares of visx stock on the open market in and  respectively 
this was partially offset by cash received upon the issuance of stock under employee stock programs of million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents on april   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to million shares of visx common stock may be repurchased 
in accordance with this authorization and applicable securities laws  we have repurchased million shares on the open market cumulatively through december   at a total cost of million 
accordingly  million shares remain available as of december  for repurchase under the board of directors april authorization 
on may   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of visx stock at a total cost of million  all of which were purchased during the quarter ended june  before repurchasing shares we consider a number of factors including market conditions  the market price of the stock  and the number of shares needed for employee benefit plans 
as a result  we cannot predict the number of shares that we may repurchase in the future 
purchases of short term investments represent reinvestment into short term investments of the proceeds from short term investments that matured and investment of cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding  nor any credit agreements 
our normal credit terms granted to customers are net to days 
in an effort to promote the growth of the laser vision correction industry and the use of visx star systems and wavescan systems  we provide long term financing to customers for their purchase of our equipment in certain markets 
we consider a number of factors including industry practice  competition  and our evaluation of customers credit worthiness in determining when to offer such financing 
we believe our operations will generate cash in at a level equal to or greater than in we believe this will exceed cash required to fund our working capital and capital equipment needs during the coming twelve months 
in addition  we have million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of december  to provide for unforeseen contingencies and to support strategic objectives including the development or acquisition of new technologies and our stock repurchase program 
in may  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement for a portfolio of patents held by luis ruiz  md  relating to the treatment of presbyopia with multifocal ablations 
visx also signed an agreement with tracey technologies  llc for rights to tracey s ray tracing technology for use in customized laser vision correction treatments 
if clinical and regulatory milestones specified in both agreements are achieved  visx will be committed to make additional payments of approximately million in connection with these two agreements 
visx could be obligated for royalties in the future based on any future sales of the associated products

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
which it had originally issued in january as revised  fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
as revised  application of fin is required for interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application for all other types of entities covered by fin is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of fin as revised  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty 
the factors set forth below  which are not the only risks we face  may cause our actual results to vary from those contemplated by forward looking statements set forth in this report and should be considered carefully in addition to the other information presented in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
our results of operations have varied widely in the past and could continue to vary significantly 
in addition  our actual results may differ significantly from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
accordingly  we believe that our results of operations in any given period may not be a good indicator of our future performance 
market acceptance 
our business depends upon broad market acceptance of laser vision correction by both doctors and patients in the united states and key international markets 
laser vision correction has penetrated less than of the eligible united states population  and our profitability and continued growth will be largely dependent on increasing levels of market acceptance and procedure growth  especially with regard to our higher priced customvue procedure 
although laser vision correction offers a more predictable outcome and more precise results than other surgical methods used to correct refractive disorders  it is not without risk 
potential complications and side effects include post operative discomfort  corneal haze an increase in the light scattering properties of the cornea during healing  glare halos undesirable visual sensations produced by bright lights  decreases in contrast sensitivity  temporary increases in intraocular pressure in reaction to procedure medication  modest fluctuations in refractive capabilities during healing  modest decrease in best corrected vision ie  with corrective eyewear  unintended over or under corrections  regression of effect  disorders of corneal healing  corneal scars  corneal ulcers  and induced astigmatism which may result in blurred or double vision and or shadow images 
some consumers may choose not to undergo laser vision correction because of these complications or more general concerns relating to its safety and efficacy or a resistance to surgery in general 
alternatively  some consumers may elect to delay undergoing laser vision correction surgery because they believe improved technology or methods of treatment will be available in the near future 
should either the ophthalmic community or the general population turn away from laser vision correction as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders  or if future technologies replaced laser vision correction  these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
unfavorable side effects 
the possibility of long term side effects and adverse publicity regarding laser correction surgery could seriously harm our business 
laser vision correction is a relatively new procedure 
consequently  there is 
table of contents no long term follow up data beyond ten years that might reveal additional complications or unknown side effects 
any future reported side effects  other adverse events or unfavorable publicity involving patient outcomes resulting from the use of laser vision correction systems manufactured by visx or any participant in the laser vision correction market  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 
government regulation 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products 
government regulation includes inspection of and controls over research and development  testing  manufacturing  safety and environmental controls  efficacy  labeling  advertising  promotion  pricing  record keeping  the sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and samples and electronic records and electronic signatures 
in the united states  we must obtain fda approval or clearance for each medical device that we market 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
products distributed outside of the united states are also subject to government regulation  which may be equally or more demanding 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
if a regulatory authority delays approval of a potentially significant product  our market value and operating results may decline 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our products  we will not be able to market these products  which would result in a decrease in our sales 
currently  we are actively pursuing approval for a number of our products from regulatory authorities in a number of countries  including  among others  the united states  countries in the european union and japan 
continued growth in our sales and profits will depend  in part  on the timely and successful introduction and marketing of some or all of these products 
the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain 
we incur substantial expense for  and devote significant time to  clinical trials but cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product 
we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results 
any of our products may produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate 
we  the fda  or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if they or we believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 
noncompliance with applicable united states regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  denial or withdrawal of pre marketing approvals  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has authority to request repair  replacement  or the refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
regulatory authorities outside of the united states may impose similar sanctions for noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
new technologies 
if we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to develop new methods of vision correction  customers may not buy our products and our revenue may decline 
we must be able to manufacture and effectively market those products and persuade a sufficient number of eye care professionals to use the new products as well as new methods of vision correction such as our customvue procedure  that we introduce 
sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if a new product is introduced by one of our competitors or if we announce a new product that  in either case  represents a substantial improvement over our existing products 
a decrease in procedure volume may also occur if consumers elect to delay undergoing laser vision correction surgery because they believe improved technology or methods of treatment will be available in the near future 
new products may not be commercially viable 
while we devote significant resources to research and development  our research and development may not lead to new products that achieve commercial success 
the research and development process is expensive  prolonged  and entails considerable uncertainty 
development of a new medical device  from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch  typically takes between three and seven years 
each of these periods varies considerably from product to product and country to country 
because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic research and development  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products successfully 
the products currently in our development pipeline may not be approved by regulatory entities and may not be commercially successful  and our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products 
competition 
intense competition in the laser vision correction industry could result in the loss of customers  an inability to attract new customers  or a decrease in prices for our products 
the medical device and ophthalmic laser industries are subject to intense competition and technological change 
not only does laser vision correction compete with more 
table of contents traditional vision correction options such as eyeglasses and contact lenses  it also competes with other technologies and surgical techniques such as intraocular lenses  and surgery using different types of lasers 
in addition  the market for laser vision correction systems has become increasingly competitive in recent years as a result of fda approval of several laser systems 
the visx star system competes with products marketed or under development by other laser and medical equipment manufacturers  many of which have greater financial and other resources 
competitors may offer laser systems at a lower price  may price their laser systems as part of a bundle of products or services  may develop procedures that involve a lower per procedure cost  or may offer products perceived as preferable to the visx star system 
in addition  medical companies  academic and research institutions and others could develop new therapies  including new medical devices or surgical procedures  for the conditions targeted by visx  which therapies could be more medically effective and less expensive than laser vision correction  and could potentially render laser vision correction obsolete 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
procedure market share 
marketscope estimates that we are currently the leader in the united states procedures market with a market share of over 
because of this position all of our competitors target us and our market share in order to grow their own revenues 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain or grow our existing market share and we may  in fact  be required to incur considerable expenditures in order to maintain that share 
should our procedure market share decline  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations as well as the market price of our common stock 
economic conditions 
because laser vision correction is not subject to reimbursement from third party payors such as insurance companies or government programs  the cost of laser vision correction is typically borne by individuals directly 
accordingly  weak or uncertain economic conditions may cause individuals to be less willing to incur the procedure cost associated with laser vision correction as was evidenced by our decline in revenues from compared to and from compared to a decline in economic conditions especially in the united states  could result in a decline in the number of laservision correction procedures performed and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 
significant customers 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to tlc vision tlc 
tlc and its operating subsidiaries accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
additionally  tlc  accounted for   and of our total receivables at december   and  respectively 
should we lose a significant customer or if anticipated sales to a significant customer do not materialize  our business  financial position and results of operations may suffer 
in addition  should a significant customer become unable to pay balances owed  we would have to increase our charges for bad debt expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
patents and intellectual property disputes 
our business is dependent on the enforceability and the validity of our united states and foreign patents 
we own over united states and foreign patents and have more than patent applications pending 
in the past  our patents have been challenged on several fronts and we have asserted our patents against competitors 
generally  these proceedings centered on whether infringement of the patents had occurred  and on the validity or enforceability of the patents 
while all of these proceedings have now been resolved  we may assert our patents against competitors in the future 
if our patents were found to be invalid or unenforceable or in the event that parties against whom visx asserted patent infringement were found not to be infringing our patents in any future proceedings  our ability to collect license fees from the parties to the litigation or from other sellers or users of laser vision correction equipment in the united states could suffer and our revenues could decline 
in addition  other companies own united states and foreign patents covering methods and apparatus for performing corneal surgery with ultraviolet lasers 
if we were accused of infringing such competitors patents and found to have infringed such patents  we could be subject to significant monetary liability and enjoined from distributing our products 
any one of these results could harm our business 
product liability claims 
we have and may become subject to product liability claims 
we could be liable for injuries or damage resulting from use of the visx star system or wavescan system 
in addition  a claim that an injury resulted from a defect in any visx product  even if successfully defended  could damage our reputation 
although we possess insurance customarily obtained by businesses of our type including insurance against product liability risks associated with the testing  manufacturing  and marketing of our products  product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 

table of contents international operations 
we face risks due to our reliance on sales in international markets 
during   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues from sales to customers outside the united states 
our international presence exposes us to risks including the need for export licenses  unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other potential trade barriers and restrictions  political  legal and economic instability in foreign markets  longer accounts receivable cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  foreign currency fluctuations  reduced or limited protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries  and dependence on local distributors 
if one or more of these risks materialize  our sales to international customers may decrease and our costs may increase  which could negatively impact our revenues and operating results 
distributors 
internationally  we sell our products through distributors 
if we fail to maintain our existing distribution channels or develop additional channels in the future  our ability to sell products internationally could be impaired and our business harmed 
third party financing entities 
we have relationships with third party financing entities that purchase our products directly and subsequently lease and or sell these products to our end user customers  or provide financing directly to customers who purchase our products directly from us 
should any third party financing entity or entities fail or refuse to pay us in a timely manner or at all  it could negatively affect our cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
in fact  dvi  which provided equipment purchase financing to our customers  entered into chapter bankruptcy proceedings in august  and as a result  we recorded bad debt expense to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts to cover the entire million of accounts receivables then outstanding from dvi 
fixed short term expenses 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  our earnings will decline if we do not meet our projected sales 
any shortfall in revenues below expectations would likely have an immediate impact on our earnings per share  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating expenses  which include sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses  are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  if revenues fall below expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to such a shortfall 
acquisitions of businesses or technology 
we have acquired technology assets and may need to continue to do so to retain our competitive position within the marketplace 
if we acquire businesses  new products or technologies in the future  we may be required to amortize significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and we may record significant amounts of goodwill that will be subject to annual testing for impairment 
if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities  our existing stockholders ownership could be significantly diluted 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
additionally  such an acquisition could have a substantial impact on our business  our financial position and our results of operations 
taxes 
we operate throughout the united states and  consequently  are subject to various federal  state and local taxes  including sales  income  payroll  unemployment  property  franchise  capital and use tax on our operations  payroll  assets and services 
although we believe we have adequate provisions and accruals in our financial statements for tax liabilities  
table of contents we cannot predict the outcome of all past and future tax assessments 
if any taxing authority determines we owe amounts for taxes greater than we expect  our earnings may be negatively affected 
key personnel 
the success of our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could result in significant disruption to our ongoing operations and hurt our business 
additionally  our inability to attract new senior executives and key personnel could significantly impact our business results 
single sources for key components 
the manufacture of the visx star system and wavescan system is a complex operation involving numerous procedures 
we depend on single and limited sources for several key components 
if any of these suppliers were to cease providing components  we would be required to locate and contract with a substitute supplier 
we could have difficulty identifying a substitute supplier in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms 
if the production of our products  parts and services were interrupted or could not continue in a cost effective or timely manner  our business  financial position  and results of operations  could be materially adversely affected 
volatility of our stock price 
the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
our stock price can fluctuate for a number of reasons  including announcements about us or our competitors  results or settlements of litigation  quarterly variations in operating results  the introduction or abandonment of new technologies or products  changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  and economic changes and political uncertainties 
in addition  stock markets have experienced significant price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies 
in addition  the securities of many medical device companies  including visx  have historically been subject to extensive price and volume fluctuations that may affect the market price of their common stock 
if these broad market fluctuations continue  they may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
proprietary information and inventions agreements 
we protect our proprietary technology  in part  through proprietary information and inventions agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
these agreements with employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals to assign to us  without additional consideration  inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
if any of our employees  consultants or others breach these agreements our competitors may learn of our trade secrets 
changes to the accounting for stock options 
the financial accounting standards board has indicated that possible rule changes requiring expensing of stock options may be adopted in the near future 
currently  we include such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to our annual financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states but do not include stock option expense for employee options in our reported financial statements 
if accounting standards are changed to require us to expense stock options  our reported earnings will decrease significantly and our stock price could decline 
exercising of stock options 
as of december   there were an aggregate of  shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding vested stock options 
if these stock options are exercised  the total number of our traded shares will increase and this could adversely impact our earnings per share 

table of contents antitakeover provisions in our charter documents 
in  we adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the presence of this plan could make it more difficult for a third party to engage in a takeover attempt  even a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price for our common stock 
in addition  the presence of the plan could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions may also impact the amount of interest investors have in our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we invest our cash  beyond that needed for daily operations  in high quality debt securities 
we seek primarily to preserve the value and liquidity of our capital  and secondarily to safely earn income from these investments 
to accomplish these goals  we invest only in debt securities issued by the united states treasury and united states government agencies and corporations and united states corporations that meet the following criteria rated investment grade a or higher by the major rating services  can readily be resold for cash  and mature no more than years from our date of purchase 
the following table shows the expected cash flows at maturity from our investments in debt securities s 
beyond cash equivalents and short term investments amortized cost as of december  weighted average effective interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we sell products in various international markets 
virtually all of these sales are contracted and paid for in united states dollars 
as of december  we have no outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts 
accordingly  we have no material foreign currency exchange risk as of december
