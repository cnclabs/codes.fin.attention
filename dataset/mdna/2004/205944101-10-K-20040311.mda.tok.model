item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations referred to as management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as the critical accounting policies of cnf and its subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which include additional information about cnf s significant accounting policies and practices and the transactions that underlie cnf s financial results 
cnf provides supply chain management services for commercial and industrial shipments by land  air and sea throughout the world 
cnf s principal businesses consist of con way and the menlo worldwide group of businesses 
however  for financial reporting purposes  cnf is divided into five reporting segments 
the operating results of con way  a provider of regional less than truckload ltl freight services  are reported as one reporting segment while menlo worldwide is divided into three reporting segments forwarding  primarily a global provider of air freight and ocean forwarding services  logistics  a provider of integrated contract logistics solutions  and menlo worldwide other  which consists of vector  a joint venture with gm that serves as the lead logistics manager for gm 
also  certain corporate activities and the results of road systems  a trailer manufacturer  are reported in the separate cnf other reporting segment 
cnf s operating results are generally expected to depend on the number and weight of shipments transported  the prices received on those shipments  and the mix of services provided to customers  as well as the fixed and variable costs incurred by cnf in providing the services and the ability to manage those costs under changing shipment levels 
as more fully discussed in item  business  con way and forwarding primarily transport shipments through freight service center networks while logistics and vector manage the logistics functions of their customers and primarily utilize third party transportation providers for the movement of customer shipments 
results of operations consolidated results in  cnf s net income available to common shareholders was million per diluted share  a decline from net income available to common shareholders in was million per diluted share  which included a million after tax net loss per diluted share from discontinued operations 
in  cnf reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of million per diluted share  which included a million after tax gain per diluted share from discontinued operations 
gains and losses from discontinued operations in all periods presented were due to the terminated priority mail contract with the us postal service and or the business failure of consolidated freightways corporation cfc in september  as described below under discontinued operations 
continuing operations the following table compares results from continuing operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts for the years ended december revenues operating income loss net income loss from continuing operations after preferred stock dividends diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations 
table of contents cnf s results from continuing operations for all reported periods included various income or loss items that affected the year to year comparisons of the reported operating income or loss 
these special items  which were identified as such by cnf s management based in part on their materiality to the relevant reporting segment  are separately summarized under each reporting segment 
continuing operations overview compared to cnf s revenue in increased to billion  as both con way and the menlo worldwide group of businesses achieved revenue growth amid improved us and global economic conditions 
consolidated operating income rose to million  due principally to significantly higher operating income from con way 
a larger operating loss at forwarding and a decline in operating income from logistics was partially offset by higher operating income at vector 
special items  which are separately summarized under each reporting segment  resulted in a net operating loss of million in  while reflects a million net gain from special items 
con way s operating income grew in to million  due principally to the effect of revenue growth and operating leverage 
forwarding s operating loss increased to million in from million in  reflecting a million net operating loss from the effect of special items in compared to a million net gain from special items in forwarding s revenue in grew  but was insufficient to cover its costs 
although north american air freight revenue decreased in  the rate of decline slowed from the previous two years 
gross margins on international air freight fell  primarily from the loss of higher margin business related to the prior year port disruption  partially offset by an increase in higher margin military business in in response to continued declines in north american air freight revenue  forwarding recognized a million restructuring charge in  primarily to reduce costs of its north american freight service center network 
logistics operating income in fell to million as a higher percentage of lower margin services contributed to lower operating income despite a increase in revenue 
vector s operating income  which rose to million  reflects compensation earned under amended agreements with gm  its joint venture partner and customer 
other net expense in of million was essentially unchanged from as a million decline in investment income and a million increase in interest expense were mostly offset by an million increase in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies 
higher interest expense in was primarily due to the settlement of interest rate swaps in december  which effectively converted long term debt from fixed rate to floating rate prior to their termination 
cnf recognized equity venture losses of million in and million in in  cnf s income from continuing operations before income tax provision increased over on growth in revenue and operating income 
cnf s net income from continuing operations after income taxes and preferred stock dividends declined in despite higher revenue and operating income  primarily due to an increase in the effective tax rate to in from in  which reflects a million reversal of accrued taxes from the settlement of tax matters in continuing operations overview compared to consolidated revenue in fell to billion as a revenue decline at forwarding was partially offset by revenue growth at con way and logistics 
operating income of million in  including the million net gain from special items  improved from a million operating loss in  which included a net loss of million from special items 
operating income in was largely due to improved operating results from the menlo worldwide businesses  partially offset by lower operating income from con way  whose operating income fell due principally to higher employee costs 
operating results in largely reflect the adverse effect of special items  including a million restructuring charge at forwarding and a million loss from the business failure of a logistics customer 

table of contents other net expense of million was essentially flat in as higher costs of obtaining letters of credit and a decline in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies were mostly offset by lower interest expense on long term debt 
cnf recognized equity venture losses of million in and million in in  net income from continuing operations of million primarily reflects the significant improvement in consolidated operating results and a low effective tax rate  as described above  while the net loss of million from continuing operations in was substantially due to the significant special charges at forwarding and logistics

selected air freight operating statistics international revenue per day weight yield north america revenue per day weight yield during  forwarding s revenue grew  due to higher international air freight revenue partially offset by lower north american air freight revenue 
strong growth in international air freight revenue per day was largely due to a increase in international average pounds per day weight  which benefited from 
table of contents improved business levels in asian and european markets and from an increase in war related military business  which primarily benefited the first quarter of weight in was positively affected by labor related disruption of western us ports  which temporarily diverted some international freight from ocean carriers to air carriers in the fourth quarter of revenue per pound yield on international freight rose slightly in  principally from higher fuel surcharges and an increase in higher yield military business  partially offset by the loss of higher yield business related to the port disruption in excluding fuel surcharges  international yield in fell from north american air freight revenue per day in fell on a increase in weight and a decline in yield  which was due primarily to a higher percentage of lower yield delivery services in  partially offset by the yield enhancing effect of higher fuel surcharges 
excluding fuel surcharges  the decline in north american yield was 
forwarding s efforts to increase second day and deferred delivery services  as well as a decline in the demand for next day delivery services  contributed to a higher percentage of lower yield second day and deferred delivery services 
the decline in demand for next day delivery services was due primarily to a loss of business to transportation providers using ground based modes of delivery 
forwarding s operating loss increased to million in from million in  reflecting a million net operating loss in from the effect of special items and  in  a million net gain from special items 
forwarding s revenue in grew  but was insufficient to cover its costs 
although north american air freight revenue decreased in  the rate of decline slowed from the previous two years 
gross margins on international air freight fell  primarily from the loss of higher margin business related to the prior year port disruption  partially offset by an increase in higher margin military business in in response to continued declines in north american air freight revenue  forwarding in recognized a million restructuring charge  primarily to reduce the costs of its north american freight service center network  as more fully discussed below under restructuring plans 
management will continue forwarding s focus on increasing the revenue and operating margins of its variable cost based international operations and  in north america  will continue its efforts to align its costs with revenues 
in  forwarding s revenue fell from to billion  due primarily to lower north american air freight revenue  essentially flat international air freight revenue  and the termination by the us postal service usps of ewa s contract to transport express mail  as described below under express mail contract 
in  forwarding recognized revenue of million from the express mail contract until termination of the contract effective in august forwarding s average international air freight revenue per day in was essentially unchanged from as a improvement in weight was offset by a decline in yield 
growth in international weight in was attributable in part to improved business levels in international markets served by forwarding  particularly in asia 
weight and yield in benefited from business related to the labor related port disruption 
international yields in were negatively affected by a decline in fuel surcharges from excluding fuel surcharges  international yield in fell 
north american air freight revenue per day fell in on a decline in north american weight and a drop in yield 
north american weight in was negatively affected by comparatively weaker us economic conditions  a reduction in the number of aircraft routes and domestic markets served by forwarding  and a loss of business to ground transportation providers  while was adversely affected by lost business from the september  terrorist attacks 
in  lower yield in north america was due in part to forwarding s efforts to increase second day and economy service  which contributed to a higher percentage of lower yield service offerings and from lower fuel surcharges 
excluding fuel surcharges  the decline in north american yield was 
forwarding s operating loss in improved to million from million in forwarding s operating loss in included a million net gain from special items while the operating loss in reflects special items that collectively represented a million net charge  which consisted primarily of forwarding s restructuring charges  as detailed below under restructuring plans 
forwarding s operating loss in was reduced by lower airhaul costs  a decrease in employee costs and a decline in depreciation  aircraft lease payments and aircraft related expenses 

table of contents restructuring plans restructuring plan in june  forwarding began an operational restructuring to align it with management s estimates of future business prospects for domestic heavy air freight and to address changes in market conditions  which deteriorated due primarily to a slowing domestic economy and loss of ewa s contracts with the usps to transport express mail and priority mail 
the million second quarter restructuring charge in consisted primarily of non cash impairment charges of million and million of estimated future cash expenditures related primarily to the return to lessors of certain aircraft leased to ewa 
based on issues identified during inspections conducted by the federal aviation administration faa  on august   ewa was required to suspend its air carrier operations as part of an interim settlement agreement with the faa 
as a result  ewa furloughed approximately pilots and crew members and forwarding made arrangements to continue its service to customers by utilizing aircraft operated by several other air carriers 
primarily in response to the faa action and a worsening global economic downturn  forwarding re evaluated its restructuring plan 
on december   cnf announced that forwarding formerly known as emery or emery forwarding in would become part of cnf s new menlo worldwide group of supply chain services providers and in north america would utilize aircraft operated by other air carriers instead of ewa operating its own fleet of aircraft  and that ewa would permanently cease air carrier operations 
in connection with the revised restructuring plan  in the fourth quarter of forwarding recognized additional restructuring charges of million  including million for the planned disposal of leased aircraft  cessation of ewa s remaining operations  and other costs  and million for employee separation costs for of ewa s non pilot employees 
in connection with cnf s announcement of the cessation of ewa s air carrier operations on december   ewa terminated the employment of all of its pilots and crew members  bringing the total number of terminated employees in to those pilots and crew members are represented by alpa under a collective bargaining agreement 
subsequently  alpa filed a grievance on behalf of the pilots and crew members protesting the cessation of ewa s air carrier operations and forwarding s use of other air carriers 
the alpa matters are subject to binding arbitration 
based on cnf s current evaluation  management believes that it has provided for its estimated exposure related to the alpa matters 
however  cnf cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters 
following the fourth quarter restructuring charge in  forwarding s cash flows have reflected the cost of having other air carriers provide service to forwarding s north american customers as well as lease payments and other costs associated with forwarding s restructuring plan  however  forwarding s operating expenses have reflected the cost of aircraft operated by other carriers but have not included scheduled lease payments and return costs or other restructuring related payments  as these expenses were accrued in connection with the restructuring charges 
forwarding s restructuring reserves for aircraft and other costs declined to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to aircraft lease payments and return costs 
none of the aircraft that were grounded in connection with forwarding s restructuring plan remained under lease as of december  restructuring reserves at december  consisted primarily of cnf s estimated exposure related to labor matters in arbitration  as described above  as well as other estimated restructuring obligations 
restructuring plan in response to continued declines in north american air freight revenue  forwarding continued restructuring its operations in the fourth quarter of  primarily to reduce the costs of its north american freight service center network 
under the restructuring plan  forwarding closed nine service centers located in markets for which the transportation of shipments between service centers and customers could be served more cost 
table of contents effectively by cartage agents 
in connection with the restructuring plan  forwarding recognized a million charge  primarily for the accrual of future lease payments on closed facilities and employee termination costs 
management estimates the restructuring plan will reduce annual operating expenses in by million with no adverse effect on revenue levels or the quality and coverage of delivery service 
lower future operating expenses are expected to result primarily from a decline in service center lease expense and lower employee costs  partially offset by higher costs for third party cartage service 
forwarding s restructuring charges recognized during and reflect cnf s estimate of the costs of the related restructuring activities 
cnf believes that these estimates are adequate to cover these costs based on information currently available and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ from this estimate  and that difference would be recognized as additional expense or income in the period when and if that determination can be made
