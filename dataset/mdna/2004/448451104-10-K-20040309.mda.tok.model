item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview huttig is one of the largest domestic distributors of building materials used principally in new residential construction and in home improvement  remodeling and repair work 
we distribute our products through distribution centers serving states 
our wholesale distribution centers sell principally to building materials dealers  national buying groups and home centers  who  in turn  supply the end user 
our builder resource locations sell directly to professional builders and contractors 
our american pine products manufacturing facility in prineville  oregon  produces softwood mouldings 
approximately of american pine s sales were to huttig s distribution centers during various factors historically have caused our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
these factors include levels of construction  home improvement and remodeling activity  weather  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates  competitive pressures  availability of credit and other local  regional and economic conditions 
many of these factors are cyclical or seasonal in nature 
we anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
our first quarter and  occasionally  our fourth quarter are adversely affected by winter weather patterns in the midwest  mid atlantic and northeast  which typically result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
because much of our overhead and expenses remain relatively fixed throughout the year  our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
we believe we have the product offerings  warehouse and builder support facilities  personnel  systems infrastructure and financial and competitive resources necessary for continued business success 
our future revenues  costs and profitability  however  are all likely to be influenced by a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under cautionary statement 
branch consolidations during the third quarter of  we decided to consolidate and reorganize branch operations in our southeast and northeast regions to eliminate overlapping sales territories  reduce costs and more effectively address our existing and potential customer base 
based on the production capabilities  product mix and proximity of our albany  georgia and dothan  alabama locations  we closed our albany branch and consolidated its production facilities and operations with those of our dothan branch 
we also reorganized our sales territories  allowing our dothan  alabama  macon  georgia  and jacksonville  florida branches to better service our customer base 
as of december   we completed this consolidation  including the transfer of assets and inventory from albany to dothan  as well as the sales territory reorganization 
as of december   we also completed the consolidation of our sharon  vermont branch into our manchester  new hampshire branch 
we also reorganized our sales territories among our manchester  taunton  massachusetts and selkirk  new york branches 
we believe that this consolidation will allow us to provide better customer service  improve our production capabilities  expand our product mix and grow sales in our northeast region 
in connection with these branch consolidations  we recorded a million severance expense at september   all of which we expect to have paid during the first quarter of critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management bases these estimates and assumptions on historical results and known trends  as well as our forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
actual results could differ from these estimates  assumptions and forecasts 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable consist of amounts owed for orders shipped to customers and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
huttig s corporate management establishes an overall credit policy for sales to customers and is responsible for all credit decisions 
the reserve for bad debt is determined based on a number of factors including when customer accounts exceed days past due or sooner depending on the credit strength of the customer 
our credit policies  together with monitoring of customer balances  have resulted in average bad debt expense of approximately of net sales during the last three years 
lifo inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all of the company s inventory consists of finished goods 
approximately and of inventories were determined by using the lifo last in  first out method of inventory valuation as of december  and  respectively  the remainder were determined by the fifo first in  first out method 
had the company used the fifo method of inventory valuation for all inventories  net income would have decreased by million and million in and  respectively  and would have increased by million in during and  the lifo inventory quantities were reduced  resulting in a partial liquidation of the lifo bases  the effect of which increased net income by million and million  respectively 
during  the lifo inventory quantities increased  resulting in an increase to the existing lifo bases  the effect of which decreased net income by million 
the replacement cost would be higher than the lifo valuation by million in and million in excess and obsolete inventory reserve we provide a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory for stock inventory items that have had no sales in the past months and for those inventory items that the quantity on hand is greater than a month supply 
we also reserve for special order items that have not been sold within days from their date of receipt at our branch 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired when the discounted cash flow model results in a fair value that is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of goodwill 
we test the carrying value of other long lived assets  including intangible and other tangible assets  for impairment when events and circumstances warrant such review 
the carrying value of long lived assets are considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
contingencies we accrue expenses when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the expense 
contingencies for which we have made accruals include environmental  product liability and other legal matters 
based on management s assessment of the most recent information available  management currently does not expect any of these contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period and our financial condition could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or other circumstances related to these matters 
we accrue our best estimate of the cost of resolution of these matters and make adjustments to the amounts accrued as circumstances change 
insurance we carry insurance policies on insurable risks with coverages and other terms that we believe are appropriate 
we generally have self insured retention limits and have obtained fully insured layers of coverage above such self insured retention limits 
accruals for self insurance losses are made based on our claims experience 
we accrue for these liabilities for existing and unreported claims when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and when we can estimate those costs 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million in  a increase from when sales were million 
same branch sales increased in over sales through wholesale distribution branches were million  an increase of over as sales increased in all regions of the country 
the increase is primarily related to the strong recovery in the second quarter in the northeast region and the strong second half of the year across all regions of the country 
sales increased during the second half of compared to the second half of  which more than offset the decline in sales during the first quarter of due primarily to the severe winter weather in our northeast  mid atlantic and midwest regions 
net sales in builder resource branches were million  an increase of million over the prior year 
excluding the first quarter of  which was negatively impacted by a new competitor in the kansas city area that commenced operations in the second quarter of  we have seen a sales recovery in the kansas city market during the last three quarters of the year for as sales increased by versus the same period in net sales for our mouldings manufacturer  american pine products  were million in  a decrease of million compared to million in the sales decrease is primarily related to the severe winter weather in the first quarter of the year in the northeast and mid atlantic states and a decline in finished moulding sales prices in the second half of gross profit increased million to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and in and  respectively 
we improved inventory controls and lowered material costs in compared to these improvements were partially offset by losses on builder contracts and the loss of purchase discounts primarily during the first quarter  which negatively impacted gross margins by 
operating expenses increased million to million in compared to million in personnel expenses increased million  due largely to increased bonus expense and a higher average headcount than a year ago which reflects additions to the sales force 
non personnel expenses increased million  as rent for new buildings increased million  costs of fuel and forklift supplies increased million and costs of outside services increased million 
during  we also recorded a total of million of severance costs  which contributed to the increase in operating expenses compared to in  we reduced bad debt expense by million versus depreciation and amortization was million in  which is million higher than the increase primarily reflects the timing of our spending of million in the second half of for operating equipment replacements and for a warehouse logistics system implementation 
we recognized million in gains on disposal of capital assets during from the sale of vacant facilities 
during  gains on disposal of assets were million for the sale of vacant facilities 
net interest expense was million in  which is million less than in the decrease reflects the reduction in our effective borrowing rate resulting from the expiration of our interest rate swaps in may average debt outstanding during was million versus million in during  we recorded a charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related to our previous credit facility  which we replaced in august during  we recorded a million gain in the fair value of two interest rate swaps that did not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
these interest rate swaps expired in may during  we recorded a million gain on derivatives 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of the foregoing factors  pretax income increased  or million  to million in as compared to pretax income of million in income taxes were calculated at an effective rate of and in and  respectively 
we also incurred an after tax non cash charge of million in due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the write off of goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

see new accounting pronouncements  below  for further discussion 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million in  an decrease from when sales were million 
excluding million of sales attributable to branches that we closed  same branch net sales in decreased or million from the prior year 
approximately million of the same branch sales decrease was attributable to the impact of a new competitor in the kansas city  missouri area 
approximately million of the same branch sales decrease was due to softer sales in our other midwest region branches 
another million of our same branch sales decrease was attributable to lower housewrap sales resulting from the termination of our distribution of tyvek and our transition to typar  a competing housewrap product  which affected sales in the northwest 
also  international sales decreased million compared to due to the weak economy in the far east 
gross profit decreased million to million in from million in the change in gross profit attributable to branches that we closed was million 
the decrease attributable to lower volume was million 
of the remaining million decrease  same branch gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in versus in the decrease in gross profit percentage resulted from a shift in product mix and pricing pressures in certain regions 
operating expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease included million of cost reductions from closed branches 
the remaining decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in supplies and maintenance costs at ongoing facilities as a result of our expense reduction initiatives during the year  a million decrease in labor related costs resulting from lower headcount than the prior year  a million decrease in bad debt expense  and a million decrease in professional services fees associated with lower legal and consulting fees 
additionally  we incurred lower system implementation costs by million and lower environmental costs by million in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million from an increase in our insurance reserves  due to higher claims incidence  expenses of million for costs relating to the settlement and legal expenses of an asbestos related product liability lawsuit and a million increase in rent expense from the facilities which are leased 
depreciation and amortization was million in  which is million lower than the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to goodwill no longer being amortized  in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january  in  we amortized million of goodwill 
the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in depreciation expense in the increase in depreciation was due to our capital expenditures during the year to maintain and refurbish our buildings and equipment 
in the third quarter of  we reversed million of restructuring charges for branches that we originally planned to close but decided to keep open 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the closure of several historically under performing branches  of which million was recorded in cost of sales 
the charge was primarily for severance  inventory write downs  vacant facilities and other shutdown related costs 
see restructuring activities  below  for further discussion 
gains on disposal of assets were million in for the sale of previously closed facilities 
during  gains on disposal of assets were million for the sale of previously closed facilities 
our full year operating profits in were million  which were million less than nearly all the decline occurred in the second quarter of our third and fourth quarter operating results in were a combined million better than the same quarters a year ago 
net interest expense decreased to million in from million in our average outstanding total debt decreased million in compared to the prior year 
the interest rate swap agreements effectively provided for a fixed rate of interest 
during  we recorded a charge of million in the third quarter to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related to our previous credit facility  which we replaced with our existing senior secured revolving credit facility 
unrealized gain on derivatives of million was recorded in versus a million loss in the gain related to a million change in the fair value on two interest rate swaps that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes  which was partially offset by million of expense amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss established upon the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we also incurred an after tax non cash charge of million in due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the write off of goodwill under sfas no 
see new accounting pronouncements  below  for further discussion 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operating activities and funds available under our secured credit facility to finance seasonal working capital needs  capital expenditures and any acquisitions that we may undertake 
our working capital requirements are generally greatest in the second and third quarters  which reflects the seasonal nature of our business 
the second and third quarters are also typically our strongest operating quarters  largely due to more favorable weather throughout many of our markets compared to the first and fourth quarters 
we typically generate cash from working capital reductions in the fourth quarter of the year and build working capital during the first quarter in preparation for our second and third quarters 
we also maintain significant inventories to meet rapid delivery requirements of our customers and to enable us to obtain favorable pricing  delivery and service terms with our suppliers 
at december  and  inventories constituted approximately and of our total assets  respectively 
we also closely monitor operating expenses and inventory levels during seasonally affected periods and  to the extent possible  manage variable operating costs to minimize seasonal effects on our profitability 
cash provided from operating activities decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to an increase in trade accounts receivable and a decrease in trade accounts payable  offset in part by a decrease in inventories 
the increase in trade accounts receivable reflects higher sales in than in however  days sales outstanding improved from days at december  to days at december  our days sales outstanding is determined by dividing month end trade accounts receivable  net  by current month net sales  then multiplying by the decrease in trade accounts payable of million in compared to was primarily attributable to inventory reductions in versus and our ability in to take greater advantage of vendor discount terms 
as a result of lower inventory and higher sales volume at the end of versus  our inventory turns improved from turns at december  to turns at december  our inventory turns are determined by averaging the two most recent monthly warehouse and production cost of sales  dividing by month end fifo inventory  net  then multiplying by cash used in investing activities in reflects million of capital expenditures for normal operating activities 
these expenditures were partially offset by million of proceeds from the disposals of assets from vacant facilities 
cash used in investing activities in reflects million of capital expenditures for normal operating activities and million for a warehouse logistics system implementation at selected branches 
these expenditures were partially offset by million of proceeds on disposals of assets from vacant facilities 
cash used in financing activities is driven by payments of debt and capital lease obligations and repurchases of our own stock 
in versus  we decreased bank debt by million and repaid million of capital lease obligations 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale leaseback of technology and production equipment in in versus  we decreased bank debt by million  repaid million of capital lease obligations and repurchased million of stock under our former stock repurchase program and million of stock from our repurchase of shares from a former employee  which uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
also in  we incurred million of debt issuance costs related to our senior secured revolving credit facility 
in the second quarter of  we entered into a million four year capital lease obligation to re finance equipment under a previously existing operating lease  which also increased our fixed assets by million 
the equipment consisted of existing rolling stock  forklifts and production equipment 
the transaction had no impact on cash or our borrowing availability 
we have a million senior secured revolving credit facility  which expires in august our credit facility consists of a revolving line of credit that provides financing of up to million  including up to million of letters of credit  at a floating rate of either a libor plus from to basis points or b the prime commercial lending rate of the agent or  if greater  the federal funds rate plus plus from to basis points  in each case depending on our trailing average collateral availability 
the revolving credit borrowing base cannot exceed the sum of a up to of eligible domestic trade receivables and b up to the lesser of of the cost of eligible inventory or of the appraised net liquidation value of eligible inventory 
we pay a commitment fee in the range of to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit commitment 
huttig and its domestic subsidiary are co borrowers under this facility  and all of the borrowers assets  except real property  collateralize borrowings under the credit facility 
provisions of the credit facility  which we amended as of may  and also as of february   contain various covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to incur indebtedness  incur liens  make certain types of acquisitions  declare or pay dividends or make restricted payments  consolidate  merge or sell assets 
it also contains financial covenants tied to our borrowing base 
if  at the end of any month  our daily average borrowing base during that month exceeds our daily average outstanding borrowing and pre established reserve levels during that month by less than an average monthly amount that will adjust over the term of the facility as set forth in the table below  we must maintain or meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio set forth in the table below 
as defined in the agreement  the ratio is determined for a rolling month period by dividing ebitda plus cash rent expense  less non facility financed capital expenditures and cash taxes  by cash interest expense plus scheduled debt repayments plus cash rent expense for such period 
as defined in the credit agreement  ebitda means the sum of a net income  b interest expense  c income tax expense  d depreciation  e amortization  f write down of goodwill  and g all cash and non cash extraordinary expenses and losses  less all cash and non cash extraordinary income and gains during the period of measurement 
the monthly minimum average collateral availability and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio will adjust over the term of the facility  as set forth below fiscal month monthly minimum average collateral availability minimum fixed charge coverage ratio march through august million september million october through november million december through may million june through november million december through the maturity date million also  we may not allow our daily revolving availability under the credit facility to fall below million 
during the period of may  the date we amended the collateral availability and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements described above through december   our monthly average collateral availability exceeded the required monthly minimum average  and our daily revolving availability was in excess of million each day 
prior to february   the credit agreement that evidenced our revolving credit facility required that we maintain a mandatory lock box arrangement whereby remittances from our customers reduced the borrowings outstanding under the facility 
the credit agreement also contains a material adverse effect clause that grants the agent and lenders having more than of the commitment or borrowings the right to accelerate the maturity of the facility and to block our requests for future advances if the agent reasonably determines that an event or condition has occurred which has had  or reasonably could be expected to have  a material adverse effect on the business  operations or condition of huttig and our subsidiaries taken as a whole  our ability to perform our obligations  or the enforceability of any of the lenders rights  under the credit agreement  or the validity  perfection or priority of any lien in favor of the agent and the lenders on any of our secured assets 
our credit agreement does not expire or have a maturity date within one year  but rather has a final expiration date of august  however  emerging issues task force issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lockbox arrangement  requires borrowings under credit agreements with those two provisions to be classified as current liabilities 
as a result  we restated the december  balance sheet to reclassify million of borrowings under the credit agreement  which was previously reported as non current liability  as a current liability 
on february   we and the agent and lenders amended the credit agreement to provide for a springing lock box arrangement 
under this arrangement  we now maintain a lock box from which we may apply cash receipts to any corporate purpose so long as our monthly average availability does not fall below million and we are not in default under the credit agreement 
the agent and the lenders maintain a security interest in our lock box and  upon the occurrence of either of the foregoing triggering events  may redirect funds from the lock box to a loan account in the name of the lenders on a daily basis and applied against the revolving loan balance 
effective with the amendment  we have classified the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as long term liabilities as of december  in addition  we have restated our december  balance sheet to reflect the borrowings under the credit agreement as current liabilities as of december  this restatement will have no impact on our debt covenants under the credit agreement  our ability to draw on existing facilities or our previously reported net income 
at december   we had revolving credit borrowings of millions with million of total excess credit available under the credit facility 
the million of total excess credit available is net of letters of credit totaling million  primarily for health and workers compensation insurance 
on may   our three interest rate swap agreements expired 
these swap agreements  in combination with our revolving credit facility  effectively provided for a fixed weighted average annual rate of plus the applicable spread over libor on up to million of our outstanding revolving credit borrowings 
prior to the expiration of the swaps  when actual borrowings under the facility were less than the notional amount of the interest rate swaps  we incurred an expense equal to the difference between million and the actual amount borrowed  times the difference between the fixed rate on the interest rate swap agreement and the day libor rate 
effective may   all of our bank debt began accruing interest at a floating rate of between and basis points above libor 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and funds available under our credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our currently anticipated short term and long term liquidity and capital expenditure requirements 
commitments and contingencies the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  total payments due by period less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion capital lease obligations operating lease obligations severance obligations total amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt approximates book value because interest rates on nearly all of the outstanding borrowings are frequently adjusted 
stock repurchases in october  the company s board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program that expired in october upon expiration  the company had used million of the million authorized under the stock repurchase program 
restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the closure of several historically under performing branches  of which million was recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventory to realizable value 
other components of the charge were million for severance related costs and million for facility and other shutdown related costs 
severance costs related to approximately employees primarily at distribution center locations 
also  included in amounts charged against this restructuring reserve in was million for inventory losses and million for facility shutdown costs 
during the first six months of  we completed the closure of three facilities 
during the third quarter of  management determined not to close two branches which had originally been planned for closure 
consequently  in we reversed million of the restructuring reserve related to these two branches  the components of which are million for severance and million for facility and other shut down related costs 
the remaining balance was utilized during management change and terms of separation severance expense of million was recorded in the first quarter of as part of operating expenses for payments  including future payments  to the company s former president and chief executive officer and other employees whose employment terminated during the quarter ended march  an additional severance expense of million was recorded in the third and fourth quarters for the termination of employees related to the consolidation of branches and the reorganization of corporate headquarters staff 
during the twelve months ended december   total severance payments of million were paid 
the present values of the remaining severance payments totaled million at december   and are expected to be fully paid by march  new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
adoption of this statement is required for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  previously issued financial statements shall not be restated under sfas no 
we adopted this statement effective january   and the adoption will impact the timing of exit or disposal activities reported by us on an on going basis 
the adoption did not have any material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations for the year ended december  effective november   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer  including a reseller  for cash consideration received from a vendor 
this consensus requires that payments from a vendor be classified as a reduction to the price of the vendor s goods and taken as a reduction to cost of sales unless the payments are reimbursements for costs incurred to sell the product or payments for assets or services provided 
the consensus also requires that payments from a vendor be recognized as a reduction to cost of sales on a rational and systematic basis 
this consensus became effective for us on january  we already recognized vendor payments as a reduction to cost of sales  based on related purchase volume  and no change was required by us in adopting this consensus  thereby having no material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
cautionary statement relevant to forward looking information for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k and our annual report to shareholders contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including but not limited to statements regarding the effect of known contingencies  including risks relating to environmental and legal proceedings  on our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations  the future impact of competition  our ability to maintain favorable terms with our suppliers and transition to alternative suppliers of building products  and the effects of slower economic activity on our results of operations  expected benefits and impacts of branch consolidations  our future business success  sales volume and growth  product mix and results of operations  our liquidity and exposure to market risk  and cyclical and seasonal trends 
the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements present management s expectations  beliefs  plans and objectives regarding our future business and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on current projections  estimates  assumptions and judgments  and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following our sales and profitability depend significantly on new residential construction and home improvement activity in markets in which we compete  which is highly cyclical and seasonal 
our sales depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets 
the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential renovation projects  which are a function of many factors beyond our control 
some of these factors include employment levels  interest rates  availability of credit  housing prices  prices of commodity wood products  immigration patterns  regional demographics and consumer confidence 
future downturns in the markets that we serve or in the economy generally could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
reduced levels of construction activity may result in intense price competition among building materials suppliers  which may adversely affect our gross margins 
our first quarter revenues and  to a lesser extent  our fourth quarter revenues are typically adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in the new construction and home improvement markets decreases 
because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year  our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
the building materials distribution industry is extremely competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully with some of our existing competitors or new entrants in the markets we serve 
the building materials distribution industry is extremely competitive 
our competition varies by product line  customer classification and geographic market 
the principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and availability of product  service and delivery capabilities  ability to assist with problem solving  customer relationships  geographic coverage  and breadth of product offerings 
also  financial stability and geographic coverage are important to manufacturers in choosing distributors for their products 
we compete with many local  regional and  in some markets and product categories  national building materials distributors and dealers 
we also compete with major integrated product manufacturers with national distribution capability  such as georgia pacific  weyerhaeuser and boise cascade 
to a limited extent in some of our markets  we compete with the large home center chains  such as the home depot and lowe s  for the business of smaller contractors 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can 
we also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants  such as our new competitor in kansas city 
we can give no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors 
the termination of key supplier relationships may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we distribute building materials that we purchase from a number of major suppliers 
as is customary in our industry  most of our relationships with these suppliers are terminable without cause on short notice 
during  we began selling housewrap product  typar  in markets where we used to sell tyvek  a competing housewrap  after our distributorship of tyvek was terminated 
as a result of our having to transition to a new supplier in markets in which we formerly sold tyvek  housewrap sales declined approximately million in compared to during compared to  housewrap sales increased million or 
although we believe that relationships with our existing suppliers are strong and that we would have access to similar products from competing suppliers  any disruption in our sources of supply  particularly of our most commonly sold items  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we also can give no assurance that any supply shortages resulting from unanticipated demand or production difficulties will not occur from time to time or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient earnings in order to comply with availability requirements and financial covenants under our revolving credit facility  our ability to conduct business would be limited and we could be forced to seek alternative sources of financing 
our credit facility agreement contains various covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to incur indebtedness  incur liens  make certain types of acquisitions  declare or pay dividends or make restricted payments  consolidate  merge or sell assets 
it also contains financial covenants tied to our borrowing base 
our financial results in the near term may vary from those required by our credit facility as a result of the risks we face in our business  including those that may prevent us from achieving the levels of ebitda required under our credit facility 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve sufficient ebitda or other financial results necessary to satisfy our revolving credit facility covenants 
if we were unable to comply with these covenants  our lender would have the right  but not the obligation  to accelerate the repayment of the entire amount outstanding under the credit facility 
fluctuation in prices of commodity wood products that we buy and then resell may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
parts of our business  such as the softwood moulding manufacturing operation and our distribution centers that sell directly to home builders and large contractors  directly face the risk of periodic fluctuations in the prices of wood commodities 
changes in wood commodity prices between the time we buy these products and the time we resell them have occurred in the past and we expect fluctuations to occur again in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage these fluctuations effectively or minimize any impact of these changes on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks of incurring significant costs to comply with environmental regulations 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental protection laws and regulations and may have to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the clean up of contamination at a formerly owned property in montana  where we are voluntarily remediating this property under the oversight of the montana department of environmental quality 
until the deq selects and orders us to implement a final remedy  we can give no assurance as to the scope or cost to us of any final remediation order 
see part i  item  legal proceedings  for additional discussion 
in addition  some of our current and former distribution centers are located in areas of current or former industrial activity where environmental contamination may have occurred  and for which we  among others  could be held responsible 
we can give no assurance that we will have no material environmental liabilities with respect to any of our current or former distribution center locations in the future 
we face the risks that product liability claims and other legal proceedings relating to the products we distribute may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as is the case with other companies in our industry  we face the risk of product liability and other claims of the type that are typical to our industry  such as asbestos and mold related claims  in the event that the use of products that we have distributed causes personal injury or other damages 
product liability claims in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome and whether or not they are covered under our insurance policies or may be indemnified by our suppliers  could result in costly litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management  sales and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk as it relates to effects of changes in interest rates 
we had debt outstanding at december  under our secured revolving credit facility of million
