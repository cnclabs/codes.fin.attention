item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report and the section factors that may affect future operating results at the end of this item  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  sell or hold our common stock 
overview we are a leading provider of technology and services for digital video recorders  or dvrs  a rapidly growing consumer electronics category 
our subscription based tivo service improves home entertainment by providing consumers with an easy way to record  watch  and control television 
the tivo service also offers the television industry a platform for advertisers  content delivery  and audience research 
key elements of our strategy revolve around continued investment in technology  research and development and innovation  partnering with service providers  extending and protecting our intellectual property and continuing to promote and leverage the tivo brand  and working to improve profitability  market share  and financial strength 
our financial strength and ability to adapt to the current market and economic conditions are dependent in part on our generation of cash flow  effective management of working capital  funding commitments  and other obligations as well as the growth of our business 
executive overview and outlook during the fiscal year ended january   we achieved our two key objectives for the year  which were i growth in subscriptions and revenues and ii reduction in cash flow used in operations from the prior fiscal year 
our total installed subscription base more than doubled during the fiscal year 
the quarterly subscription growth showed strong improvement 
subscription additions in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year were  which were more than the entire installed subscription base from two years ago 
we also reduced our cash usage for the fiscal year by continuing to reduce our operating expenses 
additionally  we improved our cash balance significantly during the year by raising over million in capital from the issuance of common stock  resulting in a year end cash and cash equivalents balance of million  our strongest position in years 
the achievement of these goals has put us in a strong financial position for the fiscal year for the fiscal year ending january  we plan to significantly increase our investment in subscription acquisition activities with a focus on growing tivo service subscriptions 
we anticipate the majority of this investment will be in connection with the holiday shopping season 
we believe this investment can create incremental revenue  profits  and cash flows and put us on a long term growth trajectory towards creating sustainable profitability 
the following table sets forth selected information as of our fiscal year ended january    and fiscal year ended january  in thousands net revenues cost of revenues operating expenses loss from operations cash flows from operations net revenues 
our net revenues increased million during the fiscal year ended january  compared to the prior fiscal year 
approximately of this growth was a result of increased hardware revenues due to increased volume of tivo enabled dvrs sold to retailers and consumers 
the continued growth in our installed subscription base also contributed to the increase in our net revenues 
we have added more than million net new tivo service and directv subscriptions in the last three years 

table of contents cost of revenues 
the costs of our revenues increased by approximately during the fiscal year primarily because of increased cost of hardware revenues 
this cost increased over million  or approximately  compared to the prior fiscal year due to continued increases in our tivo enabled dvr manufacturing volume 
cost of service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased modestly compared to the prior fiscal year 
operating expenses 
over the last three years  our operating expenses have decreased primarily due to reductions in sales and marketing expenses 
we expect operating expenses to increase due to the planned increased spending on subscriber acquisition activities 
cash flows from operations 
we expect cash flows from operations in the fiscal year to decline due to higher operating expenses attributable to our planned increased subscription acquisition activities 
key business metrics management periodically reviews certain key business metrics in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources  and maximize the financial performance of our business 
these key business metrics include subscription growth and cash flows used in operations 
subscription growth management believes this metric provides an important leading indicator of revenue generation in future years 
management uses it to help evaluate the execution and performance of tivo s and directv s marketing programs in acquiring new subscriptions and retaining existing subscriptions 
we define a subscription as a tivo enabled dvr for which i a customer has paid for the tivo service and ii service is not canceled 
dvrs with the tivo basic service that do not upgrade to the tivo service are not included in our subscription totals 
as of january   our total installed subscription base was approximately  over twice the installed base as of january  included in the  subscriptions are approximately  product lifetime subscriptions that had reached the end of the four year period we use to recognize lifetime subscription revenues 
below is a table that details the growth in our subscription base during the past eight quarters 
the tivo service line items refer to subscriptions sold to customers who have tivo enabled dvrs and products  including those manufactured by tivo  sony  pioneer  toshiba  philips  and others 
the directv line items refer to subscriptions sold to customers who have integrated directv satellite receivers with tivo 
additionally  we provide a breakdown of the percent of tivo service subscriptions for which consumers pay a recurring fee 
directv reports and pays us monthly subscription fees on a per household basis 
for households with multiple dvrs  we count each dvr as a subscription 
for the month of january  directv paid us for approximately  households  which represented approximately  subscriptions 
as a result  there were approximately  directv satellite receivers with tivo for which we receive no additional payment from directv 
in january  we recognized approximately in average subscription revenue per directv subscription  excluding advertising and audience research revenues  compared to approximately in january we expect the average monthly subscription revenue per directv subscription to decline in the future as the mix of directv subscriptions shifts to the rapidly growing number of additions of new directv subscriptions  which involve no acquisition costs  lower recurring expenses  and lower subscription fees 
three months ended subscriptions in thousands jan  oct  jul  apr  jan  oct  jul  apr  tivo service directv total subscriptions net additions tivo service directv total cumulative subscriptions of tivo service cumulative subscriptions paying recurring fees 
table of contents during the three months ended january   we added approximately  net new tivo service subscriptions 
this represents growth of approximately compared to the number of subscriptions added during the three months ended january  consumer demand for tivo enabled dvr and dvd products was driven by broad availability and strong support in the retail channel  a rebate program that began in september  and increased consumer awareness of tivo 
we intend to generate continued tivo service subscription growth through managing our relationships with leading retailers like best buy  circuit city  and others 
of the  net new tivo service subscriptions  during the three months ended january   approximately elected the monthly recurring payment option 
during the three months ended january   we added approximately  net new subscriptions through directv 
this represents growth of over times the number of new directv subscriptions added in the quarter ending january  directv has increased its focus in driving demand for directv with tivo  including increased marketing investment directed at existing directv customers 
cash flows used in operations management reviews this metric to aid it in evaluating our operating results 
one of management s key objectives for the fiscal year ended january  was to improve cash flows used in operations from the prior fiscal year 
this was accomplished by decreasing net loss by approximately as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this resulted in a reduction of net cash used in operating activities 
management expects that net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year will increase as compared to the fiscal year due to increased spending attributable to our planned increased investment in subscription acquisition activities 
fiscal year ended january  in thousands net loss net cash used in operating activities 
table of contents critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we base our discussion and analysis on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles as described in note the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this analysis form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates  see item note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
recognition period for lifetime subscriptions revenues tivo offers a lifetime subscription option for the life of the dvr for a one time  upfront payment 
we recognize subscription revenues from lifetime subscriptions ratably over a four year period  based on our estimate of the useful life of these dvrs 
if the useful life of the recorder were shorter or longer than four years  we would recognize revenues earlier or later 
as of january   approximately of our total installed subscription base was product lifetime subscriptions that had reached the end of the four year period we use to recognize lifetime subscription revenues 
we continued to incur costs of services for these subscriptions without corresponding revenue 
our product is still relatively new and as we gather more user information  we might revise this estimated life 
engineering professional services project cost estimates for engineering professional services that are essential to the functionality of the software or involve significant customization or modification  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method  as described in sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of the project  an input method 
in general  these contracts are long term and complex 
we believe we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasting of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance  projecting cost to complete  tracking progress of costs incurred to date  and projecting the remaining effort to complete the project 
costs included in engineering professional services are labor  materials  and overhead related to the specific activities that are required for the project 
costs related to general infrastructure or platform development are not included in the engineering professional services project cost estimates 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract 
in some cases  we have accepted engineering professional service contracts that were expected to be losses at the time of acceptance in order to gain experience in developing new technology that could be used in future products and services 
using different cost estimates  or different methods of measuring progress to completion  engineering professional services revenues and expenses may produce materially different results 
a favorable change in estimates in a period could result in additional revenue and profit  and an unfavorable change in estimates could result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that would be borne solely by tivo 
consumer rebate redemption rates in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendors products  we record an estimated potential liability for our consumer rebate program that is based on the percentage of customers that were reimbursed for the rebate for similar programs and adjust estimates to consider actual redemptions 
the consumer rebates are recognized as rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents valuation of inventory we maintain a finished goods inventory of tivo enabled dvrs throughout the year 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
we base write downs to inventories on changes in selling price of a completed unit 
estimates are based upon current facts and circumstances and are determined in aggregate and evaluated on total pool basis 
we continually monitor inventory valuation and purchase commitments for potential losses in net realizable value 
estimates used in complex agreements we have a number of related party transactions and commitments 
many of these transactions are complex and involve multiple elements and types of consideration  including cash  debt  equity  and services 
for example  our relationship with directv has historically included subscription revenue share expense  engineering professional services revenue  common stock and warrants issued for services  and various platform subsidies 
many of our arrangements require us to make estimations for the valuation of non cash expenses  such as warrants issued for services  which must be assigned a value using financial models that require us to estimate certain parameters 
we have utilized our best estimate of the value of the various elements in accounting for these transactions 
had alternative assumptions been used  the values obtained may have been materially different 
results of operations revenues 
our revenues before rebates  revenue share  and other payments to the channel for the fiscal years ended january    and as a percentage of total revenues were as follows fiscal year ended january  revenues in thousands  except percentages service revenues technology revenues hardware revenues total revenues change from prior fiscal year nm nm not meaningful of the total service revenues and technology revenues for the fiscal years ended january    and  million  million  and  respectively  were generated from related parties 
service revenues 
service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased or million over the service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  this increase was primarily due to the growth in our subscription base 
service revenues for the year ended january  were million  double the million of service revenues for the year ended january  during the year ended january   we activated approximately  new subscriptions to the tivo service bringing the total installed subscription base to approximately  as of january   approximately greater than the installed base as of january  we anticipate fiscal year will have continued revenue growth as our subscription base grows 
revenues from advertising and research services included in service revenues  while not material during these periods  were increasing 
technology revenues 
in the fiscal year ended january   we derived of our total revenues  or million  from licensing and engineering professional services 
technology revenues for the fiscal year ended january  were approximately lower then the same period last year due to fewer licensing agreements 
two different related parties customers generated million and million of technology revenues  or and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  we recognized million of licensing and engineering professional services revenue with little corresponding costs from two customers due to the one time recognition of revenues for two projects for which we have no further obligations 
going forward  in our relationships with manufacturers and distributors  we are shifting focus from upfront license and engineering professional services payments to recurring royalty and service payments 
we expect future technology revenues to decline from the fiscal years and levels as we complete existing contracts 

table of contents hardware revenues 
hardware revenues for the fiscal year ended january  were approximately greater than the prior fiscal year period due to increased volume in tivo enabled dvrs sold to retailers and consumers 
hardware revenues for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to zero for the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal years ended january  and  one retail customer generated million and million of hardware revenues  or and of total revenues  respectively 
rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel

rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel decreased for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the respective prior fiscal year due to lower revenue share and market development funds paid to retailers 
consumer rebate expenses were million and million  respectively  for fiscal years ended january  and we expect our fiscal year payments to be higher due to our planned increased investment in subscription acquisition activities

cost of service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased modestly compared to the prior fiscal year 
total salaries and benefits for the fiscal year ended january  increased by compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increased level of staffing 
this increase was offset by a decrease in telecommunications and network expenses of  or over million  for the fiscal year ended january  this decrease was a result of continued reduction of the service cost per subscription including using satellite transmission of the tivo service for subscribers using the directv receiver with tivo 
cost of technology revenues increased by approximately or million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to increased expenses related to providing engineering professional services to two customers under agreements for which expenses exceeded the budgeted revenues 
cost of hardware revenues

table of contents costs of hardware revenues include all product costs and direct costs associated with the tivo enabled dvrs we distribute and sell  including manufacturing related overhead and personnel expenses  warranty expenses  certain licensing expenses  and order fulfillment expenses such as shipping costs 
we engage a contract manufacturer to build tivo enabled dvrs 
we do this to enable our service revenues and  as a result  do not intend to generate significant gross margins from these hardware sales 
cost of hardware revenues are driven by a variety of factors related to inventory and channel management 
cost of hardware revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased as compared to the prior fiscal year due to a higher volume of manufactured tivo enabled dvrs and related licensing expenses 
research and development expenses 
fiscal year ended january  in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses change from prior fiscal year percentage of net revenues nm our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  related expenses  and consulting fees 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended january  increased over the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased salary expenses related to an increase in engineering regular headcount of employees 
research and development expenses decreased for the fiscal year ended january  from the fiscal year ended january  due to the redeployment of engineers from research and development activities to engineering professional services activities  which were classified as costs of technology revenues 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses  media advertising  public relations activities  special promotions  trade shows  and the production of product related items  including collateral and videos 
sales and marketing expenses also include sales and marketing related parties expense

series a convertible preferred stock dividend 
under the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock  we were previously required to pay dividends to the series a convertible preferred stockholders 
pursuant to the terms of the funds release agreement dated april   aol  the sole preferred stockholder  waived the preferred dividends and associated rights it was otherwise entitled to effective april  on april   we repurchased million shares of our series a convertible preferred stock

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily from the proceeds of the sale of equity and debt securities 
our cash resources are subject  in part  to the amount and timing of cash received from subscriptions  licensing and engineering professional services customers  and hardware customers 
at january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
for the fiscal year ending january  we plan to significantly increase our investment in subscription acquisition activities with a focus on growing tivo service subscriptions 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and funds generated from operations represent sufficient resources to fund operations  capital expenditures  and working capital needs through the fiscal year ending january  statement of cash flows discussion our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations  by financing activities  and our revolving line of credit facility with silicon valley bank 
although we currently anticipate that our available funds 
table of contents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs through the fiscal year ending january   we may require or choose to obtain additional financing 
our ability to obtain financing will depend  among other things  on our development efforts  business plans  operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 
we cannot assure you that the additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience dilution 
please refer to factors that may affect future operating results below for further discussion 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activities fiscal year ended january  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities the decrease in net cash used in operating activities from fiscal year to was primarily attributable to the reduction in net loss incurred in the fiscal year compared to the primary change in net loss was continued reductions in sales and marketing expenses for revenue share and subsidy expense 
also contributing to the reduction in net loss was increased revenue from subscriptions 
the decrease in net cash used in operations was partially offset by the decrease in non cash interest expense in the fiscal year because of fewer conversions of convertible notes payable 
non cash interest expense included million attributable to the accelerated accretion of the discount due to the nbc conversion during the fiscal year the decrease in net cash used in operating activities from fiscal year to was primarily attributable to the reduction in net loss incurred for the fiscal year compared to as above  the primary change in net loss was continued reductions in sales and marketing expenses for revenue share and subsidy expense and increased revenue from subscriptions 
additionally  contributing to the increase in revenues were technology revenues 
the decrease in net cash used in operations was partially offset by an increase in non cash interest expense in the fiscal year because of conversions of convertible notes payable and the purchase of inventories as we began to sell tivo enabled dvrs to retailers and through our website 
cash from deferred revenues has increased because we sell product lifetime subscriptions and receive up front license and engineering professional services payments 
these activities cause us to receive cash payments in advance of providing the services for which the cash is received  which we recognize as deferred revenues 
net cash used in investing activities the increases in net cash used in investing activities for both the fiscal years and were primarily attributable to increased purchases of property and equipment to support our business 
additionally  during the fiscal year  we acquired intangible assets in exchange for the issuance of common stock because of the strangeberry inc acquisition and in exchange for the issuance of common stock for acquisition of patent rights 
financing activities the principal source of cash generated from financing activities relates to the issuance of common stock in registered public offerings 
these transactions generated an aggregate of million in cash  less cash financing expense of  and million in cash  less financing expenses of  for fiscal years and  respectively 
additionally  million and million were obtained from the issuance of common stock for stock options exercised for fiscal years and  respectively 
the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan generated million and million  respectively  for fiscal years and

debt issuance costs were approximately million  resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million 
of the total proceeds of million  million was recorded as prepaid advertising and promotional services 
as part of the transaction  we paid million in october to nbc for advertising that ran during the period that began october  and ended march  during the period beginning on december  and ending on january   we temporarily reduced the conversion price of our convertible notes from to per share pursuant to the indenture governing the notes in order to induce early conversions 
during this period  million in principal amount of the million outstanding principal amount of the notes was converted into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the reduced conversion price resulted in  shares of common stock being issued in addition to the  shares of common stock that would have been issuable upon conversion of the million principal amount of notes at per share 
loan and security agreement 
on july   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  whereby silicon valley bank agreed to extend to us a revolving line of credit of up to the lesser of million or a borrowing base 
the borrowing base is equal to the sum of of eligible accounts receivable plus of pledged certificates of deposit up to million 
the line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest on all of our assets except for our intellectual property 
we are required to maintain at least million in pledged certificates of deposit with silicon valley bank during the term of the line of credit 
the line of credit bears interest at the greater of prime plus or per annum  but in an event of default  the interest rate becomes above the rate effective immediately before the event of default 
the loan and security agreement includes  among other terms and conditions  limitations on our ability to dispose of our assets  merge or

at january   we were in compliance with these covenants and had zero amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit terminates and all borrowings are due on june   but may be terminated earlier by us without penalty upon written notice and prompt repayment of all amounts borrowed 
contractual obligations as of january   we had contractual obligations to make the following cash payments payments by period contractual obligations total less than year years years over years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations long term convertible notes payable at face value coupon interest on long term convertible notes payable total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments as of january   were as follows total less than year years years over years in thousands standby letter of credit total commercial commitments factors that may affect future operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
we have incurred significant net losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have incurred significant net losses and have had substantial negative cash flows 
during the fiscal years ended january    and our net loss attributable to common stockholders was million  million  and million  respectively 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
the size of these net losses depends in part on our subscription revenues and on our expenses 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
consequently  we may never achieve profitability  and even if we do  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues  increase our subscription acquisition cost  and hinder our ability to generate new subscriptions 
the dvr market is rapidly evolving and we expect to face significant competition 
moreover  the market for in home entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
as a result of this intense competition  we could incur increased subscription acquisition cost that could adversely affect our ability to reach sustained profitability in the future 
if new technologies render the dvr market obsolete  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 

table of contents we believe that the principal competitive factors in the dvr market are brand recognition and awareness  functionality  ease of use  availability  and pricing 
we currently see two primary categories of dvr competitors dvrs offered by consumer electronics companies  and dvrs offered by cable and satellite operators 
within each of these two categories  the competition can be further segmented into those offering what we define as basic dvr functionality  and those offering enhanced dvr functionality 
basic dvr functionality includes no or limited program guide data and vcr like controls with manual timeslot based recordings  usually with no dvr service fee after the consumer purchases the enabling hardware 
the tivo basic service is an example of basic dvr functionality 
enhanced dvr functionality includes rich program guide data and enhanced scheduling and personalization features  and may or may not require a dvr service fee 
the tivo service is an example of enhanced dvr functionality 
consumer electronics competitors 
we compete against several types of products with basic or enhanced dvr functionality offered by consumer electronics companies 
these products record an analog television signal output from a cable or satellite set top box  analog cable feed  or antenna 
dvrs replaytv has been our primary competitor in the standalone dvr market  offering products with some enhanced dvr functionality 
replaytv was acquired by d m holdings in d m holdings is the parent company of denon and marantz  manufacturers of premium audio and video consumer electronics products 
in addition  a number of companies have introduced or announced plans for dvrs that can record hd content  including rca and lucky goldstar 
dvd devices with integrated dvrs several consumer electronics companies  including thomson multimedia and panasonic  are producing dvrs integrated with dvd players or dvd recorders 
in general  these products do not require dvr service fees  and offer basic dvr functionality 
personal computers with dvr software several companies are developing dvr software for pc and pc related platforms 
for example  microsoft s windows xp media center edition contains expanded digital media features including some enhanced dvr functionality 
satellite and cable dvr competitors 
the directv satellite receiver with tivo service competes against other cable and satellite set top boxes that integrate basic or enhanced dvr functionality into multi channel receivers 
satellite echostar released the dishpvr in  which combined echostar dish network satellite reception with basic dvr functionality  including repeating timer based recordings 
in july  echostar released the dishpvr  which offers a limited dvr feature set 
echostar has also released the dishpvr  system for high definition signals 
additionally  it is possible that nds will begin working with directv to provide additional dvr technology to directv customers 
cable scientific atlanta sells explorer integrated digital cable dvr set top box to cable operators 
this product combines digital and analog cable reception with dual tuner dvr functionality 
motorola has announced its own plans for integrated cable dvrs 
in addition  motorola has announced plans to build integrated cable dvrs for cable operator charter communications using moxi media center software from digeo 
other dvr technology providers targeting the integrated dvr space include set top box manufacturers pioneer and pace  and software providers nds and canal technologies 
video on demand us cable operators are currently deploying server based video on demand vod technology from seachange  concurrent  ncube  and others  which could potentially evolve into competition 
server based vod relies on content servers located within the cable operator s central head end that stream video across the network to a digital cable set top box within the consumer s home 
cable operators can use vod to deliver movies  television shows  and other content to consumers 
consumers can watch this programming on demand  with vcr like pausing and rewinding capabilities 
operators can charge consumers for access to vod content on a per transaction or monthly subscription basis  or can offer content without charge 
to the extent that cable operators begin to offer regular television programming as part of their vod offerings  consumers will have an alternate means of watching time shifted shows other than using dvrs 

table of contents licensing fees 
our licensing revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully negotiate licensing agreements with our consumer electronics and service provider customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
in addition  we face competition from companies such as microsoft  opentv  nds  d m holdings  digeo  ucentric  and gotuit who have created competing digital video recording technologies 
such companies may offer more economically attractive licensing agreements to service providers and manufacturers of dvrs 
established competition for advertising budgets 
digital video recorder services  in general  and tivo  specifically  also compete with traditional advertising media such as print  radio  and television for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers do not perceive digital video recording services  in general  and tivo specifically  as an effective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budget to promotions on the tivo service 
in addition  advertisers may not support or embrace the tivo technology due to a belief that our technology s ability to fast forward through commercials will reduce the effectiveness of general television advertising 
we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture  distribute  and supply critical components and services for the dvrs that enable the tivo service 
we may be unable to operate our business if these parties do not perform their obligations 
the tivo service is enabled through the use of a dvr made available by us through a third party contract manufacturer and a limited number of other third parties 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of key components for the dvrs 
we do not control the time and resources that these third parties devote to our business 
we cannot be sure that these parties will perform their obligations as expected or that any revenue  cost savings  or other benefits will be derived from the efforts of these parties 
if any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner  we may be delayed or prevented from commercializing our products and services 
because our relationships with these parties are non exclusive  they may also support products and services that compete directly with us  or offer similar or greater support to our competitors 
any of these events could require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote additional resources to commercialize our products and services 
this outcome would harm our ability to compete effectively and achieve increased market acceptance and brand recognition 
in addition  we face the following risks in relying on these third parties if our manufacturing relationships are not successful  we may be unable to satisfy demand for our products and services 
we manufacture dvrs that enable the tivo service through a third party contract manufacturer 
we also have entered and anticipate entering into agreements with consumer electronics manufacturers to manufacture and distribute dvrs that enable the tivo service 
however  we have no minimum volume commitments from any manufacturer 
the ability of our consumer electronics manufacturers to reach sufficient production volume of dvrs to satisfy anticipated demand is subject to delays and unforeseen problems such as defects  shortages of critical components and cost overruns 
moreover  they will require substantial lead times to manufacture anticipated quantities of the dvrs that enable the tivo service 
delays  product shortages  and other problems could impair the retail distribution and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract subscriptions 
in addition  the loss of a manufacturer would require us to identify and contract with alternative sources of manufacturing  which we may be unable to do and which could prove time consuming and expensive 
although we expect to continue to contract with additional consumer electronics companies for the manufacture of dvrs in the future  we may be unable to establish additional relationships on acceptable terms 
we are dependent on single suppliers for several key components and services 
if these suppliers fail to perform their obligations  we may be unable to find alternative suppliers or deliver our products and services to our customers on time 
we currently rely on sole suppliers for a number of the key components used in the tivo enabled dvrs and the tivo service 
for example nec is the sole supplier of the cpu and application specific integrated circuit semiconductor devices  broadcom is the sole supplier of the mpeg encoder and decoder semiconductor devices  amtek is the sole supplier of the chassis  and atmel is the sole supplier of the secure microcontroller semiconductor device 

table of contents because we do not require customized components from nec  broadcom  amtek  or atmel suppliers  we do not have binding supply agreements with these suppliers 
therefore  they are not contractually obligated to supply us with these key components on a long term basis or at all 
in addition to the above  we have several sole suppliers for key components of our products currently under development 
tribune is the sole supplier of the program guide data for the tivo service 
on january   we executed a new television listings data agreement with tribune media services  inc tribune  the current sole supplier of program guide data for the tivo service 
this agreement supersedes our existing television listing agreement with tribune  which was originally executed in if our arrangements or our consumer electronics manufacturers arrangements with nec  broadcom  amtek  atmel or tribune media services were to terminate or expire  or if we or our manufacturers were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components or required program guide data from our suppliers  our search for alternate suppliers could result in significant delays  added expense or disruption in product or service availability 
intellectual property claims against us could be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
from time to time  we receive letters form third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property 
regardless of their merit  we are forced to devote time and resources to respond to these letters 
in addition  if any of these third parties or others were to sue us  our business could be harmed because intellectual property litigation may be time consuming and expensive  divert management s attention and resources away from our business  cause delays in product delivery and new service introduction  cause the cancellation of new products or services  or require us to pay significant royalties and or licensing fees 
the emerging enhanced television industry is highly litigious  particularly in the area of on screen program guides 
additionally  many patents covering interactive television technologies have been granted but have not been commercialized 
for example  we are aware of multiple patents for pausing live television 
a number of companies in the enhanced television industry earn substantial profits from technology licensing  and the introduction of new technologies such as ours is likely to provoke lawsuits from such companies 
a successful claim of infringement against us  our inability to obtain an acceptable license from the holder of the patent or other right  or our inability to design around an asserted patent or other right could cause our manufacturers to cease manufacturing dvrs that enable the tivo service  our retailers to stop selling the product or us to cease providing our service  or all of the above  which would eliminate our ability to generate revenues 
under our agreements with many of our manufacturing and licensing partners  we are obligated to indemnify them in the event that our technology infringes upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
due to these indemnity obligations  we could be forced to incur material expenses if our manufacturing and licensing partners are sued 
if they were to lose the lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
in addition  because the products sold by our manufacturing and licensing partners often involve the use of other persons technology  this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against the product in question  even if the claim does not pertain to our technology 
pending intellectual property litigations 
on september   pause technology filed a complaint against us in the us district court for the district of massachusetts alleging willful and deliberate infringement of us reissue patent no 
 entitled time delayed digital video system using concurrent recording and playback 
pause technology alleges that it is the owner of this patent  and further alleges that we have willfully and 
table of contents deliberately infringed this patent by making  selling  offering to sell  and using within the united states the tivo enabled dvr 
pause technology seeks unspecified monetary damages as well as an injunction against our operations 
it also seeks attorneys fees and costs 
on february   we obtained a favorable summary judgment ruling in the case filed against us in by pause technology llc in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
the court ruled that our software versions and above do not infringe pause s patent  and accordingly has ordered that judgment be entered in our favor 
on march   pause technology filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeal for the federal circuit  appealing the february  summary judgment ruling in favor of tivo 
we are incurring expenses in connection with this litigation  which may become material  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
on february   sony corporation notified us that command audio corporation had filed a complaint against sony electronics  inc on february  in the us district court for the northern district of california 
the complaint alleges that  in connection with its sale of digital video recorders and other products  sony infringes upon two patents owned by command audio us patent nos 
 information dissemination using various transmission modes and  method and system for information dissemination using television signals 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief  compensatory and treble damages and command audio s costs and expenses  including reasonable attorneys fees 
under the terms of our agreement with sony governing the distribution of certain dvrs that enable the tivo service  we are required to indemnify sony against any and all claims  damages  liabilities  costs  and expenses relating to claims that our technology infringes upon intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we believe sony has meritorious defenses against this lawsuit  however  due to our indemnification obligations  we are incurring material expenses in connection with this litigation 
since february  we have incurred million legal expenses 
the outcome of this matter or range of potential losses is currently not determinable 
if sony were to lose this lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
in addition  we are aware that some media companies may attempt to form organizations to develop standards and practices in the digital video recorder industry 
these organizations or individual media companies may attempt to require companies in the digital video recorder industry to obtain copyright or other licenses 
lawsuits or other actions taken by these types of organizations or companies could make it more difficult for us to introduce new services  delay widespread consumer acceptance of our products and services  restrict our use of some television content  increase our costs  and adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent on our relationship with directv for subscription growth 
our relationship with directv could be affected in the future by news corp 
s acquisition of the directv group 
on december   news corp 
acquired general motors economic interest in hughes  subsequently renamed the directv group 
simultaneously  news corp 
acquired an additional of the directv group for a total of of its outstanding stock 
it is possible that directv under news corp 
could seek to transition to an alternative dvr technology platform  such as that created by nds  which is majority owned by news corp 
it is also possible news corp 
may slow the pace of dvr deployment by directv in an effort to protect its content businesses from perceived threats posed by dvrs 
if our current agreement with directv expires without being renewed  amended  or replaced  our business could be harmed 
a significant number of our new and existing tivo service subscriptions are directv customers with tivo 
our current agreement with directv does not expire until february neither tivo nor directv will have any further obligations to each other  if our current agreement with directv expires without being renewed  amended  or replaced 
while directv would have the right to continue to service existing directv receivers with tivo without payment to tivo  it would not have the right to add new directv customers with tivo 
and while tivo would no longer be able to generate additional revenue from the then current directv customers with tivo  tivo would have no further obligation to provide upgrades  fixes  new features  or software support 
directv  however  also has the option under our current agreement to buy a royalty bearing software and technology license from tivo 
this license would grant directv access to our source code and technology to make  modify with certain exceptions  sell  and distribute directv receivers with tivo to add new subscribers after the expiration of our current agreement 
our limited operating history may make it difficult for us or investors to evaluate trends and other factors that affect our business 
we were incorporated in august and we have been providing subscription services only since march  prior to that time  our operations consisted primarily of research and development efforts 
to date  only a limited number of dvrs have been sold and we have obtained only a limited number of subscriptions to the tivo service 
as a result of our limited operating history  our historical financial and operating information is of limited value in evaluating our future operating results 
it may be difficult to predict accurately our future revenues  costs of 
table of contents revenues  expenses  or results of operations 
in addition  any evaluation of our business must be made in light of the risks and difficulties encountered by companies offering products or services in new and rapidly evolving markets 
dvr services are a relatively new product category for consumers and it may be difficult to predict the future growth rate  if any  or size of the market for our products and services 
we may be unable to accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors facing us 
as a result  we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts and adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
such inability could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected  which could cause the price of our stock to decline 
we face a number of challenges in the sale and marketing of the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
our success depends upon the successful retail marketing of the tivo service and related dvrs  which began in the third quarter of calendar year many consumers are not aware of the benefits of our products 
dvr products and services represent a relatively new consumer electronics category 
retailers  consumers  and potential partners may perceive little or no benefit from digital video recorder products and services 
we have only been providing the tivo service since and many consumers are not aware of its benefits and therefore  may not value the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
we will need to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to educate consumers and promote our products in order to increase our subscriptions 
we cannot be sure that a broad base of consumers will ultimately subscribe to the tivo service or purchase the products that enable the tivo service 
consumers may not be willing to pay for our products and services 
many of our customers already pay monthly fees for cable or satellite television 
we must convince these consumers to pay an additional subscription fee to receive the tivo service 
consumers may perceive the tivo service and related dvr as too expensive 
in order to continue to grow our subscription base  we will need to continue to reduce our costs and lower the price of our dvr 
the availability of competing services that do not require subscription fees will harm our ability to effectively attract and retain subscriptions 
in addition  dvrs that enable the tivo service can be used to pause  rewind  and fast forward through live shows without an active subscription to the tivo service 
if a significant number of purchasers of the tivo enabled dvrs use these devices without subscribing to the tivo service or cancel their existing subscriptions  our revenue growth will decline and we may not achieve profitability 
we compete with other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services for consumer spending 
dvrs and the tivo service compete in markets that are crowded with other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services 
the competition for consumer spending is intense and many consumers on limited budgets may choose other products and services over ours 
dvrs compete for consumer spending with products such as dvd players  satellite television systems  personal computers  and video game consoles 
the tivo service competes with home entertainment services such as cable and satellite television  movie rentals  pay per view  and video on demand 
see we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues and ability to generate subscriptions 
many of these products or services have established markets  broad user bases  and proven consumer acceptance 
in addition  many of the manufacturers and distributors of these competing devices and services have substantially greater brand recognition  market presence  distribution channels  advertising and marketing budgets and promotional  and other strategic partners 
faced with this competition  we may be unable to effectively differentiate the dvr or the tivo service from other consumer electronics devices or entertainment services 
we compete with digital cable and satellite dvrs 
cable and satellite service providers are accelerating deployment of integrated cable and satellite receivers with dvrs that bundle basic dvr services with other digital services and do not require their customer to purchase hardware 
if we are not able to enter into agreements with these service providers to embed the tivo service into their offerings  our ability to attract their subscribers to the tivo service would be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
it is expensive to establish a strong brand 
we believe that establishing and strengthening the tivo brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and to establishing key strategic relationships 
the importance of brand recognition will increase as current and potential competitors enter the digital video recorder market with competing products and services 
our ability to promote and position our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services and customer support 
these activities are expensive and we may not generate a corresponding increase in subscriptions or revenues to justify these costs 
if we fail to establish and maintain our brand  or if our brand value is damaged or diluted  we may be unable to attract subscriptions and effectively compete in the digital video recorder market 

table of contents we rely on our customers and consumer electronics manufacturers to market and distribute our products and services 
in addition to our own efforts  our customers and consumer electronics manufacturers distribute dvrs that enable the tivo service 
we rely on their sales forces  marketing budgets and brand images to promote and support dvrs and the tivo service 
we expect to continue to rely on our relationships with these companies to promote and support dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the loss of one or more of these companies could require us to undertake more of these activities on our own 
as a result  we would spend significant resources to support dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
we also expect to rely on directv and other partners to provide marketing support for the tivo service 
the failure of one or more of these companies to provide anticipated marketing support will require us to divert more of our limited resources to marketing the tivo service 
if we are unable to provide adequate marketing support for dvrs and the tivo service  our ability to attract subscriptions to the tivo service will be limited 
we have agreed to share a substantial portion of the revenue we generate from subscription fees with some of our customers and consumer electronics companies 
we may be unable to generate enough revenue to cover these obligations 
in previous agreements  we have agreed to share a substantial portion of our subscription and other fees with some of our customers and consumer electronics manufacturing companies in exchange for manufacturing  distribution and marketing support  and discounts on key components for dvrs 
under these agreements  we may be required to share substantial portions of the subscription and other fees attributable to the same subscription with multiple companies 
these agreements also require us to share a portion of our subscription fees whether or not we increase or decrease the price of the tivo service 
if we change our subscription fees in response to competitive or other market factors  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our decision to share subscription revenues is based on our expectation that these relationships will help us obtain subscriptions  broaden market acceptance of digital video recorders  and increase our future revenues 
if these expectations are not met  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
if we are unable to create multiple revenue streams  we may not be able to cover our expenses 
although our initial success depends on building a significant customer base and generating subscription fees from the tivo service  our long term success will depend on securing additional revenue streams such as licensing  advertising  audience measurement research  revenues from programmers  and electronic commerce 
in order to derive substantial revenues from these activities  we will need to attract and retain a large and growing base of subscriptions to the tivo service 
we also will need to work closely with television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies  and consumer electronics manufacturers to develop products and services in these areas 
we may not be able to work effectively with these parties to develop products that generate revenues that are sufficient to justify their costs 
in addition  we are currently obligated to share a portion of these revenues with several of our strategic partners 
any inability to attract and retain a large and growing group of subscriptions and strategic partners will seriously harm our ability to support new services and develop new revenue streams 
if we are unable to introduce new products or services  or if our new products and services are unsuccessful  the growth in our subscription base and revenues may suffer 
to attract and retain subscriptions and generate revenues  we must continue to add functionality and content and introduce products and services which embody new technologies and  in some instances  new industry 
table of contents standards 
this challenge will require hardware and software improvements  as well as new collaborations with programmers  advertisers  network operators  hardware manufacturers  and other strategic partners 
these activities require significant time and resources and may require us to develop and promote new ways of generating revenue with established companies in the television industry 
these companies include television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies  and consumer electronics manufacturers 
in each of these examples  a small number of large companies dominate a major portion of the market and may be reluctant to work with us to develop new products and services for digital video recorders 
if we are unable to further develop and improve the tivo service or expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner  our ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue will suffer 
if we fail to manage our growth  it could disrupt our business and impair our ability to generate revenues 
the growth in our subscription base has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
specific risks we face as our business expands include any inability of our systems to accommodate our expected subscription growth may cause service interruptions or delay our introduction of new services 
we internally developed many of the systems we use to provide the tivo service and perform other processing functions 
the ability of these systems to scale as we rapidly add new subscriptions is unproven 
we must continually improve these systems to accommodate subscription growth and add features and functionality to the tivo service 
our inability to add software and hardware or to upgrade our technology  systems or network infrastructure could adversely affect our business  cause service interruptions or delay the introduction of new services 
we will need to provide acceptable customer support  and any inability to do so would harm our brand and ability to generate and retain new subscriptions 
our ability to increase sales  retain current and future subscriptions and strengthen our brand will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
some customers require significant support when installing the dvr and becoming acquainted with the features and functionality of the tivo service 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products and services to a diverse customer base  and we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers require 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with third parties to provide this support and will rely on them for a substantial portion of our customer support functions 
our failure to provide adequate customer support for the tivo service and dvr will damage our reputation in the digital video recorder and consumer electronics marketplace and strain our relationships with customers and consumer electronics manufacturers 
this could prevent us from gaining new or retaining existing subscriptions and could cause harm to our reputation and brand 
we will need to improve our operational and financial systems to support our expected growth  and any inability to do so will adversely affect our billing and reporting 
to manage the expected growth of our operations  we will need to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations and expected growth 
for example  we replaced our accounting and billing system at the beginning of august delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and cause harm to our reputation and brand 
delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting 
we must manage product transitions successfully in order to remain competitive 
the introduction of a new product or product line is a complex task  involving significant expenditures in research and development  training  promotion and sales channel development  and management of existing product inventories to reduce the cost associated with returns and slow moving inventory 
as new products are introduced  we intend to monitor closely the inventory of products to be replaced  and to phase out their manufacture in a controlled manner 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute product transitions in this manner or that product transitions will be executed without harming our operating results 
failure to develop products with required features and performance levels or any delay in bringing a new product to market could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our competitive position 

table of contents the lifetime subscriptions to the tivo service that we currently offer commit us to providing services for an indefinite period 
the revenue we generate from these subscriptions may be insufficient to cover future costs 
we currently offer product lifetime subscriptions that commit us to provide service for as long as the dvr is in service 
we receive the lifetime subscription fee for the tivo service in advance and amortize it as subscription revenue over four years  which is our estimate of the service life of the dvr 
if these lifetime subscriptions use the dvr for longer than anticipated  we will incur costs without a corresponding revenue stream and therefore will be required to fund ongoing costs of service from other sources 
as of january   we had approximately  product lifetime subscriptions that had exceeded the four year period we use to recognize lifetime subscription revenues 
tiered pricing for the tivo service may reduce our average revenue per user 
we may elect to offer additional tiers of the tivo service at various price points  which may have the effect of reducing our average revenue per user 
the nature of some of our relationships may restrict our ability to operate freely in the future 
from time to time  we may engage in discussions with other parties concerning relationships  which may include equity investments by such parties in our company 
we currently have such relationships with companies  including directv and sony 
while we believe that such relationships have enhanced our ability to finance and develop our business model  the terms and conditions of such relationships may place some restrictions on the operation of our business in the future 
we have limited experience in overseeing manufacturing processes and managing inventory and failure to do so effectively may result in supply imbalances or product recalls 
we have contracted for the manufacture of certain tivo enabled dvrs with a contract manufacturer 
we sell these units to retailers and distributors  as well as through our own online sales efforts 
as part of this effort  we expect to maintain some finished goods inventory of the units throughout the year 
overseeing manufacturing processes and managing inventory are outside of our core business and our experience in these areas is limited 
if we fail to effectively oversee the manufacturing process and manage inventory  we may suffer from insufficient inventory to meet consumer demand or excess inventory 
ineffective oversight of the manufacturing process could also result in product recalls 
we have agreed to subsidize the cost of manufacturing dvrs  which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to achieve profitability 
in prior years  we entered into agreements with our consumer electronics manufacturers to manufacture dvrs that enable the tivo service 
in certain agreements  we agreed to pay our manufacturers a per unit subsidy for each dvr that they manufactured and sold 
the amount of the payments varied depending upon the manufacturing costs and selling prices 
under some of these arrangements  we paid a portion of the subsidy when the dvr was shipped  and we did not receive any revenues related to the unit until the unit was sold and the purchaser activated the tivo service 
we may make additional subsidy payments in the future to consumer electronic and other manufacturers in an effort to maintain a commercially viable retail price for the dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
product defects  system failures or interruptions to the tivo service may have a negative impact on our revenues  damage our reputation and decrease our ability to attract new customers 
our ability to provide uninterrupted service and high quality customer support depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
our computer hardware and other operating systems for the tivo service are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
these types of interruptions in the tivo service may reduce our revenues and profits 
we currently house the server hardware that delivers the tivo service at only one location and continue to explore the benefits of establishing a backup facility 
our business also will be harmed if consumers believe our service is unreliable 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  service outages will create a flood of customer questions and complaints that must be responded to by our customer support personnel 
any frequent or persistent system failures could irreparably damage our reputation and brand 

table of contents we have detected and may continue to detect errors and product defects 
these problems can affect system uptime and result in significant warranty and repair problems  which could cause customer service and customer relations problems 
correcting errors in our software or fixing defects in our products requires significant time and resources  which could delay product releases and affect market acceptance of the tivo service 
any delivery by us of products or upgrades with undetected material product defects or software errors could harm our credibility and market acceptance of the dvrs and the tivo service 
in addition  defective products could cause a risk of injury that may subject us to litigation or cause us to have to undertake a product recall 
for example  we have become aware of occasions where a part has come loose from the remote control device that comes with the dvrs that enable the tivo service  including occurrences where a young child has gagged on or ingested a part of the remote control device 
while we are unaware of any injuries resulting from the use of our products  if we are required to repair or replace any of our products  we could incur significant costs  which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we need to safeguard the security and privacy of our subscriptions confidential data  and any inability to do so may harm our reputation and brand and expose us to legal action 
the dvr collects and stores viewer preferences and other data that many of our customers consider confidential 
any compromise or breach of the encryption and other security measures that we use to protect this data could harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments could compromise or breach the systems we use to protect our subscriptions confidential information 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches 
uncertainty in the marketplace regarding the use of data from subscriptions could reduce demand for the tivo service and result in increased expenses 
consumers may be concerned about the use of viewing information gathered by the tivo service and dvr 
currently  we gather anonymous information about our customers viewing choices while using the tivo service  unless a customer affirmatively consents to the collection of personally identifiable viewing information 
this anonymous viewing information does not identify the individual customer 
privacy concerns  however  could create uncertainty in the marketplace for digital video recording and our products and services 
changes in our privacy policy could reduce demand for the tivo service  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm our reputation and business 
we may be required to repurchase our outstanding convertible senior notes upon a repurchase event  however  we may not be able to do so 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes for cash upon a repurchase event  which includes certain changes in control and a failure of our shares of common stock to be listed for trading on nasdaq or a us national securities exchange 
our silicon valley bank line of credit agreement may limit us  under certain circumstances  from repaying the repurchase price in cash if we have amounts borrowed against it 
additionally  future debt agreements may prohibit us from repaying the repurchase price in cash 
if we are prohibited from repurchasing the notes  we could seek consent from our lenders to repurchase the notes 
if we are unable to obtain their consent  we could attempt to refinance the notes 
if we were unable to obtain a consent or refinance  we would be prohibited from repurchasing the notes 
even if we are not prohibited from repurchasing the notes  we may not have sufficient funds to do so 
if we were unable to repurchase the notes upon a repurchase event  it would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes 
the occurrence of an event of default under the notes could lead to the acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the notes  and may also trigger cross default provisions resulting in the acceleration of our other then existing debt 
these events in turn could harm our share price as well as our ability to continue our operations 
entertainment companies may claim that some of the features of our dvrs violate copyright laws  which could force us to incur significant costs in defending such actions and affect our ability to market the tivo service and the products that enable the tivo service 
although we have not been the subject of such actions to date  one of our former competitor s digital video recorders was the subject of several copyright infringement lawsuits by a number of major entertainment companies  including the three major television networks 
these lawsuits alleged that the competitor s digital video recorders violate copyright laws by allowing users to skip commercials  delete recordings only when instructed and use the internet to send recorded materials to other users 
tivo enabled dvrs have some similar features  including the ability to fast forward through commercials  the ability to delete recordings only when instructed  and when the tivotogo tm service is released  the ability to transfer recordings from a tivo enabled dvr to a pc 
based on 
table of contents market or consumer pressures  we may decide in the future to add additional features similar to those of our former competitors or that may otherwise be objectionable to entertainment companies 
if similar actions are filed against us based on current or future features of our dvrs  entertainment companies may seek injunctions to prevent us from including these features and or damages 
such litigation can be costly and may divert the efforts of our management 
furthermore  if we were ordered to remove features from our dvrs  we may experience increased difficulty in marketing the tivo service and related tivo enabled dvrs and may suffer reduced revenues as a result 
our success depends on our ability to secure and protect patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology 
we rely on patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others to protect our intellectual proprietary rights 
however  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
we have filed patent applications and provisional patent applications covering substantially all of the technology used to deliver the tivo service and its features and functionality 
to date  several of these patents have been granted  but we cannot assure you that any additional patents will ever be granted  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property or that third parties will not challenge any issued patents 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that may be issued to us 
our failure to secure and protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against echostar communications corporation and may incur significant expenses as a result  and an adverse outcome could harm our business 
on january   we filed a complaint against echostar communications corporation in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging willful and deliberate infringement of us patent no 
 entitled multimedia time warping system 
on january   we amended our complaint to add echostar dbs corporation  echostar technologies corporation  and echosphere limited liability corporation as additional defendants 
we allege that we are the owner of this patent  and further allege that the defendants have willfully and deliberately infringed this patent by making  selling  offering to sell and or selling digital video recording devices  digital video recording device software  and or personal television services in the united states 
on march   echostar filed its answer to tivo s complaint  moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction  and moved to transfer the case from the eastern district of texas to the northern district of california 
tivo intends to oppose these motions 
we seek unspecified monetary damages as well as an injunction against the defendants further infringement of the patent 
we could incur material expenses in this litigation 
we could be prevented from selling or developing our tivo software if the gnu general public license governing the linux operating system and linux kernel and similar licenses under which our product is developed and licensed is not enforceable 
the linux kernel and the linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license and similar open source licenses 
these licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied  modified  and distributed 
the gnu general public license is a subject of litigation in the case of the sco group  inc v 
international business machines corp  pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
sco group  inc  or sco  has publicly alleged that certain linux kernels contain unauthorized unix code or derivative works 
uncertainty concerning sco s allegations  regardless of their merit  could adversely affect our manufacturing and other customer and supplier relationships 
it is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in that litigation or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in our tivo software that runs on a linux based operating system 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our tivo software and would adversely effect our business 
if there is an adverse outcome in the class action litigation that has been filed against us  our business may be harmed 
we and certain of our officers and directors are named as defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
this action  which is captioned wercberger v 
tivo et al  also names several of the underwriters involved in our initial public offering as defendants 
this class action is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock from 
table of contents september   the time of our initial public offering  through december  the central allegation in this action is that our ipo underwriters solicited and received undisclosed commissions from  and entered into undisclosed arrangements with  certain investors who purchased our common stock in our ipo and in the after market 
the complaint also alleges that the tivo defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose in our ipo prospectus that the underwriters had engaged in these allegedly undisclosed arrangements 
more than issuers have been named in similar lawsuits 
in july  an omnibus motion to dismiss all complaints against issuers and individual defendants affiliated with issuers including the tivo defendants was filed by the entire group of issuer defendants in these similar actions 
on october   our officers were dismissed as defendants in the lawsuit 
on february   the court in this action issued its decision on defendants omnibus motion to dismiss 
this decision dismissed the section b claim as to tivo but denied the motion to dismiss the section claim as to tivo and virtually all of the other issuer defendants 
on june   the plaintiffs announced a proposed settlement with us and the other issuer defendants 
the proposed settlement provides that the insurers of all settling issuers will guarantee that the plaintiffs recover billion from non settling defendants  including the investment banks who acted as underwriters in those offerings 
in the event that the plaintiffs do not recover billion  the insurers for the settling issuers will make up the difference 
under the proposed settlement  the maximum amount that could be charged to our insurance policy in the event that the plaintiffs recovered nothing from the investment banks would be approximately million 
we believe that we have sufficient insurance coverage to cover the maximum amount that we may be responsible for under the proposed settlement 
our board of directors approved the proposed settlement at a meeting held on june  it is possible that the parties may not reach agreement on the final settlement documents or that the federal district court may not approve the settlement in whole or part 
in the event that the parties do not reach agreement on the final settlement  we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend this action vigorously  however  we could be forced to incur material expenses in the litigation  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
legislation  laws or regulations that govern the television industry  the delivery of programming and the collection of viewing information from subscriptions could expose us to legal action if we fail to comply or could require us to change our business 
the delivery of television programming and the collection of viewing information from subscriptions via the tivo service and a dvr represent a relatively new category in the television and home entertainment industries 
as such  it is difficult to predict what laws or regulations will govern our business 
changes in the regulatory climate  the enactment of new legislation  or the expansion  enforcement or interpretation of existing laws could expose us to additional costs and expenses and could require changes to our business 
for example  legislation regarding customer privacy or copyright could be enacted or expanded to apply to the tivo service  which could adversely affect our business 
new or existing copyright laws could be applied to restrict the capture of television programming  which would adversely affect our business 
it is unknown whether existing laws and regulations will apply to the digital video recorder market 
therefore  it is difficult to anticipate the impact of current or future laws and regulations on our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications and cable industries 
the majority of fcc regulations  while not directly affecting us  do affect many of the companies on whom we substantially rely for the marketing and distribution of the dvr and the tivo service 
as such  the indirect effect of these regulations may adversely affect our business 
in addition  the fcc could promulgate new regulations  or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would cause us to incur significant compliance costs or force us to alter the features or functionality of the tivo service 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs and may affect our ability to be in compliance with such new corporate governance provisions in the future 
the existing federal securities laws and regulations impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting 
with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of in july  a significant number of new corporate governance requirements have been adopted or proposed 
these new requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and impose increased civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs  increase the difficulty and expense in obtaining director and officer liability insurance  and make it harder for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and or qualified executive officers 
such developments could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
additionally  we will have to comply with section of the 
table of contents sarbanes oxley act beginning with our fiscal year ending january  which will require our management to report on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting and requires our independent auditors to provide a related attestation as to management s evaluation 
if we are not successful in complying with these requirements  our business could be harmed 
the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america is uncertain and volatile  and significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward 
the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and continually changing 
recent actions and public comments from the securities exchange commission have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
similarly  the us congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles 
the fasb has recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards  or are developing new proposed standards  such as accounting for stock options  which would represent a significant change from current industry practices 
in addition  many companies accounting policies are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public 
while we believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our financial statements going forward 
in addition  were we to change our critical accounting estimates  including with respect to the recognition of revenue from our lifetime subscriptions  our results of operations could be significantly impacted 
if we lose key management personnel  we may not be able to successfully operate our business 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of any members of our executive management team and our inability to hire additional executive management could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we do not have key man insurance policies for any of our key personnel 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  rights agreement and delaware law could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of our common stock 
we may become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover of our company 
although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests of our stockholders  certain provisions of delaware law  our organizational documents and our rights agreement could be impediments to such a takeover 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing 
in addition  special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of the total number of authorized directors  the chairman of the board  our chief executive officer or the holders of or more of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that directors may be removed only for cause by a vote of a majority of the stockholders and that vacancies on the board of directors created either by resignation  death  disqualification  removal or by an increase in the size of the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors in office  although less than a quorum 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors and specifies that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
on january   our board of directors adopted a rights agreement 
each share of our common stock has attached to it a right to purchase one one hundredth of a share of our series b junior participating preferred stock at a price of per one one hundredth of a preferred share 
subject to limited exceptions  the rights will become exercisable following the tenth day after a person or group announces the acquisition of or more or or more in the case of america online  inc and its affiliates and associates until such time as america online and its affiliates and associates cease to beneficially own any common shares of our common stock  and thereby becomes an acquiring person  or announces commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer  the consummation of which would result in the ownership by the person or group of or more or or more in the case of america online and its affiliates and associates until such time as america online and its affiliates and associates 
table of contents cease to beneficially own any common shares of our common stock 
the rights are not exercisable as of april  we will be entitled to redeem the rights at per right at any time prior to the time that a person or group becomes an acquiring person 
these provisions of delaware law  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and our rights agreement could make it more difficult for us to be acquired by another company  even if our acquisition is in the best interests of our stockholders 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the future  our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
therefore  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some periods our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include demand for tivo enabled dvrs and the tivo service  the timing and introduction of new services and features on the tivo service  seasonality and other consumer and advertising trends  changes in revenue sharing arrangements with our strategic relationships  entering into new or terminating existing strategic partnerships  changes in the subsidy payments we make to certain strategic relationships  changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in the consumer electronics market  timing of revenue recognition under our licensing agreements  loss of subscriptions to the tivo service  and general economic conditions 
because our expenses precede associated revenues  unanticipated shortfalls in revenues could adversely affect our results of operations for any given period and cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
consumer electronic product sales have traditionally been much higher during the holiday shopping season than during other times of the year 
although predicting consumer demand for our products is very difficult  we have experienced that sales of dvrs and new subscriptions to the tivo service have been disproportionately high during the holiday shopping season when compared to other times of the year 
if we are unable to accurately forecast and respond to consumer demand for our products  our reputation and brand will suffer and the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
we expect that a portion of our future revenues will come from targeted commercials and other forms of television advertising enabled by the tivo service 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be seasonal and cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with our advertisers  which could cause our revenues from advertisements to decline significantly in any given period 

table of contents if we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  our ability to effectively manage growth and build a strong brand could be harmed 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through the next twelve months 
however  as we continue to grow our business  we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we cannot raise necessary additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will decline  stockholders may experience dilution in net book value per share  or these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
any debt financing  if available  may involve covenants limiting  or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
the large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price for our stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
several of our significant stockholders own a substantial number of our shares 
as of january   aol owned  shares of our common stock 
as of january  hughes electronics corporation owned  shares of our common stock and presently exercisable warrants to purchase an additional  shares of which  were exercised by hughes on march  
we have granted hughes demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of their warrants and hughes may sell their shares in registered offerings pursuant to their registration rights  and aol and hughes may sell their shares in accordance with rule under the securities act 
in addition  in august  we issued million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes due  of which  as of january   there was million in principal amount still outstanding 
as of january   these notes were convertible into a maximum of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the convertible notes offering  we also issued five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  all of which were still outstanding as of january  pursuant to registration rights agreements with the investors in that offering  we have registered the resale of the convertible notes  warrants and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of the convertible notes or warrants 
as of january   options to purchase a total of  shares were outstanding under our option and equity incentive plans  and there were  shares available for future grants 
we have filed registration statements with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our option and equity incentive plans 
future sales of the shares of the common stock described above  or the registration for sale of such common stock  or the issuance of common stock to satisfy our current or future cash payment obligations or to acquire technology  property  or other businesses  could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale or issuance of such stock  as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans  as well as the shares issuable upon conversion or exercise of our outstanding convertible notes and warrants  also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
we expect to continue to experience volatility in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
since our initial public offering in september through april   our common stock has closed between per share and per share  closing at on april  the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to  among other things  the factors discussed in this section and the following factors changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  our failure to meet  or our ability to exceed  the expectations of securities analysts or investors  
table of contents release of new or enhanced products or introduction of new marketing initiatives by us or our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of the creation  developments under or termination of significant strategic relationships  joint ventures  significant contracts or acquisitions  fluctuations in the market prices generally for technology and media related stocks  fluctuations in general economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  market conditions affecting the television and home entertainment industry and the technology sector  fluctuations in operating results  and additions or departures of key personnel 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging companies  and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock
