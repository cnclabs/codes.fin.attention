overview lml payment systems inc is a financial payment processor 
we provide check risk services such as electronic check authorization  electronic check processing services such as electronic check conversion and return check management such as traditional and electronic recovery services to retail clients 
we also provide mainframe payment processing software modules and rights to use our patented intellectual property to retailers and other payment processors 
when we provide return check management services  we typically receive revenue when we are successful at recovering the principal amount of the original transaction on behalf of the client 
in some instances we also earn a percentage of the principal amount and in some other instances our secondary recovery services provide for us to earn additional fees when legal action is required 
when we provide check authorization and electronic check conversion services we typically earn revenue based upon the number of transactions we process through our data center 
due to their interrelated nature  we often bundle check authorization  check processing and check recovery services into combined service packages and market these packages under our lasr brand name live authorization settlement and recovery 
when we provide mainframe based payment software modules to clients who are of sufficient size and possess the technical capability to process financial transactions in house  or through their own data center  we typically earn revenue by way of a fixed software license fee 
in some instances we also earn revenue by way of royalties that are typically based upon a fixed sale price or on a usage or transaction basis 
when we provide clients licenses to our intellectual property estate that includes five us patents describing electronic check processing methods  we typically earn revenue from release fees for potential past infringement and ongoing royalty fees 
in a former  separate business segment  we owned and managed a acre manufactured home retirement property known as wildwood estates  in wildwood  florida 
operations included the sale of manufactured homes and lots 
in exchange for monthly maintenance fees  we provided the resident community with certain amenities and services commonly associated with similar developments 
during the year ended march   we sold the wildwood estates property for total gross proceeds of approximately million cash 
we now concentrate all our activity in the financial payment processing segment and provide our financial payment processing services from our office locations in scottsdale  arizona  wichita  kansas and dallas  texas 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue total revenue for fiscal year was approximately million  approximately a increase over total revenue of approximately million for fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in revenue associated with the licensing of our intellectual property estate and royalties received from checkfree corporation 
revenue from electronic check verification increased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the increase is partially attributable to us providing a full year of check processing services  including electronic check verification  to certain grocery stores in houston  texas and increased rates from some existing clients 
revenue from our primary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year revenue from our secondary check collections business increased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year we believe the reduction in revenue from our primary check collections business is partially a result of us no longer providing electronic check recovery services for one of our largest customers and partially a result of a decrease in overall returned check volume from our existing customers 
revenue from our licensing of certain payment software modules was approximately  for fiscal year  compared to approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the software license fee we received from checkfree corporation in the third quarter of fiscal year relating to the checkfree pep reach product an accounts receivable check conversion product 
revenue from royalties received from checkfree pertaining to their marketing of the pep reach product was approximately  for fiscal year  versus nil for fiscal year we believe future royalties are dependent upon the continued successful marketing by checkfree corporation of the pep reach product 
we believe that the number of electronic check transactions will continue to increase and believe that such increases will provide continued revenue opportunities for us 
according to nacha  accounts receivable check conversion  referred to by many as arc  grew last year to over million transactions 
we believe that the potential for the arc market is much larger than current processing levels 
we have estimated that current paper accounts receivable lockboxes now process approximately billion items per year 
our partnership with checkfree corporation and their marketing of the pep reach product to banks  financial institutions and other organizations who currently provide paper lockbox services to clients  represents an important growth opportunity for us 
revenue from licensing our patented intellectual property increased approximately from approximately  for fiscal year to approximately  for fiscal year during the year ended march   we entered into an agreement regarding our intellectual property estate regarding the processing of electronic check transactions with verus 
the agreement involved a fee in exchange for a release regarding potential past infringements of our intellectual property estate by verus 
the agreement also included separate running royalty fees in exchange for a license regarding future electronic check transactions processed by verus 
the fee for a release has been recognized and included in revenue during the year ended march   and the separate running royalty fees are being recognized on a monthly basis 
during the year ended march   we terminated a separate sub license agreement that had been granted to global etelecom inc global during the year ended march  the remaining balance of approximately  of the initial sub license fee paid to us by global  which had been deferred and was being recognized over the terms of the agreement with global  was recorded as revenue on the date of termination 
we continue to actively seek to license our patent estate and have received various levels of interest from entities regarding licensing arrangements 
our goal is to negotiate long term arrangements based upon favourable financial terms while at the same time preparing to enforce the rights granted to us under our patent estate 
while we have not fully quantified the results of successfully licensing our patent estate  we expect that licensing arrangements would have a significant positive impact upon our future financial performance 
during the year ended march   eleven  our largest customer  informed us that they would not be renewing their contract for check authorization and recovery services with us 
during the past two fiscal years  revenue from eleven directly attributable to this contract amounted to approximately in fiscal and in fiscal of our total revenue 
we ceased providing check authorization and recovery services to eleven on may  we believe that replacement revenue may come from sales of our electronic check verification  recovery and electronic check conversion products and services to existing and new merchant clients  the licensing of our patented technology regarding electronic check processing and royalties from software licensing agreements 
failure to successfully replace some or all of this revenue could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
costs of operations costs of operations consist of transaction processing costs  personnel costs  equipment related costs and telecommunication costs 
costs of operations decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease was partially attributable to certain cost reductions  including staff  implemented during the third quarter of fiscal which we expect to result in a reduction of our cost of operations by approximately  per year 
for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year costs of operations were approximately million in the first quarter  approximately million in the second quarter  and approximately million in the third quarter and fourth quarter  respectively 
we continue to seek ways to reduce costs of operations 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences and public relations 
sales  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
for fiscal year  sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year amortization and depreciation amortization on intangibles decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in amortization on intangibles is primarily attributable to the non compete agreements originating from previous years acquisitions becoming fully amortized during the fiscal year depreciation expenses relating to our system software and other software decreased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year depreciation expense for capital assets decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to certain capital assets  which were acquired through previous years acquisitions  becoming fully depreciated during fiscal year stock based compensation in fiscal year  we adopted new accounting standards which require fair value accounting for all stock options issued during the year 
the total fair value stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period resulting in a stock compensation expense of approximately  for the fiscal year other expenses income in fiscal year  we had other income of approximately  compared to other expenses of approximately  in fiscal year other income was attributed to the reconciliation of outstanding trade receivables and payables 
other expenses in fiscal were mainly attributed to foreign exchange losses from cash and cash equivalents held in canadian currency 
interest income  net interest expense decreased to approximately  in fiscal year from approximately  in fiscal year interest income for fiscal year decreased to approximately  from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in interest income was primarily attributed to a decrease in interest rates from an average of approximately in fiscal year to approximately in fiscal year income taxes we regularly evaluate the realizability of our future tax assets given the nature of our operations and given the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
at this time  we consider it more likely than not that the future tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
accordingly  the future tax asset is reserved in full as of march  and loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year and approximately million for fiscal year loss from continuing operations per both basic and diluted shares was approximately for fiscal year  as compared to approximately for fiscal year discontinued operations during the year ended march   we sold our wildwood estates property  previously reported in a separate business segment  for total gross proceeds of approximately million cash 
we recorded net profit of approximately  which was primarily attributed to a net gain of approximately  from the sale of real property and capital assets offset by a net loss of approximately  from discontinued operations 
the decision to discontinue operations of this business segment resulted from an opportunity to sell the property and consequently remove a business segment which was no longer consistent with our business strategy 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue total revenue for fiscal year was approximately million  approximately a decrease over total revenue of approximately million for fiscal year this decrease is primarily the result of reductions in revenue from our primary and secondary check collections business 
revenue from our primary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year revenue from our secondary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year we believe the reductions in revenue from our primary and secondary check collections business is partially a result of us no longer providing electronic check recovery services for one of our largest customers and partially a result of softer consumer spending trends throughout fiscal year revenue from electronic check verification increased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the increase is mainly attributable to the rollout of check processing services  including electronic check verification  to multi lane grocery stores with locations in the houston  texas area during the third quarter of fiscal year revenue from the licensing of certain modules of our software increased approximately  for the year ended march  the increases in electronic check verification revenue and software licensing revenue is consistent with our strategic objective of acquiring electronic payment volume across all our financial payment processing services and strengthening our position as a financial payment processor 
costs of operations costs of operations consist of transaction processing costs  personnel costs  equipment related costs and telecommunication costs 
costs of operations decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease was principally attributable to our implementation of electronic check recovery methods which allowed us to migrate from labor intensive traditional check recovery methods to more cost efficient electronic check recovery methods 
for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year costs of operations were approximately million in the first quarter  approximately million in the second quarter  approximately million in the third quarter and approximately million in the fourth quarter 
we continue to seek ways to reduce costs of operations 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences and public relations 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses is principally attributable to lower costs associated with the reduction of personnel costs  legal and general corporate expenses 
for fiscal year  sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year amortization and depreciation amortization on goodwill and other intangibles decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the decrease in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is associated with our adoption of the provisions of canadian institute of chartered accountants cica handbook section  goodwill and other intangible assets cica and the financial accounting standard board s fasb statement of financial account standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas which no longer subject goodwill to amortization over its estimated useful life 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed our first fair value based impairment tests and recorded a one time non cash charge of approximately million to write off the carrying value of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill for fiscal year was approximately  depreciation expenses relating to our system software and other software increased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year depreciation expense for capital assets decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributab le to certain capital assets  which were acquired through previous years acquisitions  becoming fully depreciated during fiscal year other expenses income in fiscal year  we had other expenses of approximately  compared to other income of approximately  in fiscal year other expenses were mainly attributed to foreign exchange losses from cash and cash equivalents held in canadian currency 
other income in fiscal year was attributed to the reconciliation of outstanding trade payables  which was a non cash item of approximately  an employee tax refund of approximately  offset by merger costs of approximately  interest income  net interest expense increased to approximately  in fiscal year from approximately  in fiscal year interest income for fiscal year decreased to approximately  from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in interest income was primarily attributed to a decrease in funds placed in term deposits or short term commercial paper  as well as the decrease in interest rates from an average of approximately in fiscal year to approximately in fiscal year income taxes we regularly evaluate the realizability of our future tax assets given the nature of our operations and given the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
at this time  we consider it more likely than not that the future tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
accordingly  the future tax asset is reserved in full as of march  and loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year and approximately million for fiscal year loss from continuing operations per both basic and diluted shares was approximately in fiscal year  as compared to approximately for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and financial position consisted of approximately million in working capital as of march  compared to million in working capital as of march  the increase in working capital was attributable to cash flows provided by discontinued operations of approximately million offset by cash used in operating activities of continuing operations of approximately  cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of approximately  and cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations of approximately  cash flows used in operating activities of continuing operations were approximately  for fiscal year and approximately  for fiscal year cash flows used in operating activities of continuing operations were primarily related to normal operating activities  an increase in accounts receivable of approximately  a decrease in other assets of approximately  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately  and a decrease in deferred revenue of approximately  cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to approximately  for fiscal year expenditures during fiscal year consisted mainly of capital asset expenditures and a cash investment in short term investments of approximately  short term investments are fixed investments of cash with a term of maturity greater than three months 
cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations is primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from exercise of options of our common stock in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  and potential cash flows from operations should satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  other arrangements  unexpected losses  or an economic slowdown in the retail industry could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations in fiscal year  we entered into a three year lease agreement with ibm credit corporation to finance an equipment purchase

critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in canada and form the basis for the following discussion and analysis of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the course of preparing these financial statements 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to the recognition of revenues  valuation of other long lived assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
these estimates form the basis of our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions we have used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition transaction processing and service fees are recognized in the period these services are performed 
these services consist of processing our clients electronic check authorization and conversion transactions 
these fees are charged on a per transactions basis and depend upon the contractual agreement with the client 
check recovery fees are recognized in the period when cash is received for the services performed 
these services typically consist of recovering the face amount of the original transaction and a service or collection fee 
we are typically paid the service fee only when we are successful in the recovery of the face amount of the original transaction on behalf of our client 
in cases where our clients are of sufficient size and possess the technical capability to process transactions on their own  we license certain elements of our modules of our electronic payment processing software 
we are typically paid either a fixed license fee which is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition or in some cases a fee per transaction processed by the client whereupon revenue is recognized at the time the transactions are processed  provided the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
license fees regarding the licensing of the technology embodied within our five us patents regarding electronic check processing are recognized in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition sab and further guidance provided by cica emerging issues committee eic abstract eic and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
in some instances  our licensees have paid an up front fee to obtain a license  and in such cases the up front fee is treated as deferred revenue and is recognized over the life of the agreement 
in other cases  our licensees have paid a fee for a release regarding potential past infringements of our five us patents and  in such cases  the fee is recognized as revenue when the release is granted and the amount is reasonably determinable 
running royalties earned from electronic check transactions processed by the licensee are recognized on a monthly basis 
valuation of other long lived assets we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of our other long lived assets  primarily our patents and our transactions processing software  equipment and other intangible assets  may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
when there are indications that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we perform an impairment test in accordance with cica section and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the opinion of management  our long lived assets are appropriately valued as of march  and stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees and directors under the terms of our stock option plan and our stock incentive plan 
canadian gaap provides two alternative methods of accounting for stock options under the terms and conditions we typically issue such options 
alternative one is to estimate the fair value of the stock option on the date of grant and recognize that value as an expense to operations over the stock option s vesting period alternative one 
alternative two is to estimate the fair value of the stock option on the date of grant but only reflect the impact in a pro forma disclosure setting forth compensation expense as if the fair value method was used in the corporation s financial statements and forego adjusting the consolidated statements of operations alternative two 
during the fiscal year  the canadian accounting standards board acsb released revised transitional provisions for voluntary adoption of alternative one 
these provisions permit a prospecti ve application of the alternative one recognition provisions to accounting for stock options not previously accounted for at fair value  provided we elect to apply the alternative one method to those stock options granted for our current fiscal year we adopted these transitional provisions during our fiscal year and  therefore  stock options granted during the fiscal year have been recognized under alternative one and presented as stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
stock options granted in previous fiscal years have continued to be accounted for under the alternative two method with stock based compensation expense reflected in a pro forma disclosure 
stock options granted in future fiscal years will be accounted for under the alternative one method with stock based compensation recognized as an expense to operations over the stock options vesting period 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in marketable securities which consist of money market and commercial paper 
at march   our marketable securities were recorded at a fair value of approximately million  with an overall weighted average return of and an overall weighted average life of less than three months 
our marketable securities have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of basis points of our overall average return on marketable securities in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of the marketable securities 
we are not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on long term debt since of our long term debt is at a fixed rate as of march  the fair value of our debt approximates its carrying value 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and are currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments 
we have immaterial exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency risk and are currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments
