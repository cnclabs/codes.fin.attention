overview the company provides air medical transportation services throughout the united states and designs  manufactures  and installs medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace products for domestic and international customers 
the company s divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following community based model cbm provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service 
revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
in the cbm division generated of the company s total revenue  increasing from in and in hospital based model hbm provides air medical transportation services to hospitals throughout the us under exclusive operating agreements 
revenue consists of fixed monthly fees of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees of total contract revenue billed to hospital customers 
in the hbm division generated of the company s total revenue  decreasing from in and in products division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the products division generated of the company s total revenue  decreasing from in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
the company believes that the following factors have the greatest impact on its results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
fluctuations in flight volume have a greater impact on cbm operations than hbm operations because of cbm revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to of hbm revenue 
by contrast  of the company s costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the distribution of calls within a market  the greatest single factor has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper the company s ability to operate its aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
during  the company s cbm operations had  or  more cancellations as a result of unfavorable weather conditions than during for bases which had been in operation for longer than one year 
the increased weather cancellations were more heavily weighted during the first six months of total patient transports for cbm operations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for patient transports for cbm bases open longer than one year same base transports  including rmh bases prior to acquisition  were approximately  in compared to approximately  in receivable collections 
the company responds to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient 
for cbm operations  bad debt expense is estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience 
the provision is adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
effective november  the company instituted a price increase of approximately for its cbm operations 
however  net revenue after bad debt expense per transport increased only from to  partially due to a change in payer mix caused by the acquisition of rmh 
bad debt as a percentage of related net flight revenue increased from in to in the company believes the decrease in collection rate is driven primarily by overall economic conditions 
staffing within the billing and collections department also has a direct impact on the pace of collections  and timeliness of collections may have an impact on the ultimate collectibility of receivables 
in the first quarter of  the company increased staffing in the billing and collections department to address recent slowdowns in collections 
aircraft maintenance 
both cbm and hbm operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers oem s tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
three models of aircraft within the company s fleet  representing of the total fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
total maintenance expense for cbm and hbm operations increased from to  while total flight volume for cbm and hbm operations increased over the same period 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to modernize its fleet in order to enhance long term control over maintenance costs 
replacement models of aircraft  however  typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement 
cost pressures on healthcare institutions 
publicly and privately funded healthcare institutions both face pressures to reduce the rising cost of healthcare and to modify or eliminate certain non core operations as a result of reductions in funding 
flight programs based at a single hospital typically require subsidization from other hospital operations 
as a result  a growing number of healthcare institutions are evaluating their delivery model for air medical transportation services  creating expansion opportunities for cbm operations 
in the third quarter of  the cbm division commenced operations at a new base in florida which had previously been a hospital based flight program with another vendor 
in the fourth quarter of  one the company s hbm customers converted its flight program to the cbm operated by the company 
at the expiration of contracts in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  two other hbm customers also converted their flight programs to the community based model with services provided by another operator 
the company expects the trend toward conversion of hbm programs to cbm operations to continue as healthcare institutions recognize the viable alternatives available for outsourcing 
competitive pressures from low cost providers 
the company is recognized within the industry for its standard of service and its use of cabin class aircraft 
many of the company s regional competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of the aviation and medical personnel 
however  the company believes that higher quality standards help to differentiate its service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
deploying multiple aircraft in a market also serves as a barrier to entry for lower cost providers 
employee relations 
in september  the company s pilots voted to be represented by a collective bargaining unit 
negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement began in early other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future 
although the company believes that current salary and benefits arrangements are competitive with others within the industry  the impact of a collective bargaining agreement on the cost of operations has not yet been determined

all segments in the company expects to implement new software for several major information technology systems and to upgrade the associated hardware for a total cost of approximately million 
the majority of the cost is expected to be financed through capital and operating lease agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to maintain flight volume or current levels of collections on receivables for cbm operations  renew operating agreements for its hbm operations  or generate new profitable contracts for the products division 
risk factors actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those described in forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  those discussed above in outlook for and those described below 
highly leveraged balance sheet the company is obligated under debt facilities providing for up to approximately million of indebtedness  of which approximately million was outstanding at december  if the company fails to meet its payment obligations or otherwise defaults under the agreements governing indebtedness  the lenders under those agreements will have the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against the company 
these rights and remedies include the rights to repossess and foreclose upon the assets that serve as collateral  initiate judicial foreclosure against the company  petition a court to appoint a receiver for the company  and initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the company

restrictive debt covenants the subordinated notes and senior credit facility  into which the company entered to finance the acquisition of rmh  both contain restrictive financial and operating covenants  including restrictions on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to exceed certain annual capital expenditure limits  and to engage in various corporate transactions such as mergers  acquisitions  asset sales and the payment of cash dividends 
these convenants will restrict future growth through the limitation on capital expenditures and acquisitions  and may adversely impact the company s ability to implement its business plan 
failure to comply with the covenants defined in the agreements or to maintain the required financial ratios could result in an event of default and accelerate payment of the principal balances due under the subordinated notes and the senior credit facility 
given factors beyond the company s control  such as interruptions in operations from unusual weather patterns not included in current projections  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to remain in compliance with financial covenants in the future  or that  in the event of non compliance  the company will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders  or that to obtain such waivers  the company will not be required to pay lenders significant cash or equity compensation 
flight volume all cbm revenue and approximately of hbm revenue is dependent upon flight volume 
approximately of the company s total operating expenses also vary with number of hours flown 
poor visibility  high winds  and heavy precipitation can affect the safe operation of aircraft and therefore result in a reduced number of flight hours due to the inability to fly during these conditions 
prolonged periods of adverse weather conditions could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
typically  the months from november through february tend to have lower flight volume due to weather conditions and other factors  resulting in lower cbm operating revenue during these months 
flight volume for cbm operations can also be affected by the distribution of calls among competitors by local government agencies and the entrance of new competitors into a market 
employee unionization in september  the company s pilots voted to be represented by a collective bargaining unit  the office and professional employees international union 
negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement began in early other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future 
although the company believes that current salary and benefits arrangements are competitive with others within the industry  the impact of a collective bargaining agreement on the cost of operations has not yet been determined 
governmental regulation the air medical transportation services and products industry is subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies  including the federal aviation administration  which impose significant compliance costs on the company 
in addition  reimbursement rates for air ambulance services established by governmental programs such as medicare directly affect cbm revenue and indirectly affect hbm revenue from hospital customers 
changes in laws or regulations or reimbursement rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s cost of operations or revenue from flight operations 
collection rates the company responds to calls for air medical transport without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient 
the cbm division invoices patients and their insurers directly for services rendered and recognizes revenue net of estimated contractual allowances 
the level of bad debt expense is driven by collection rates on these accounts 
changes in estimated contractual allowances and bad debts are recognized based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
collectibility is affected by the number of uninsured or indigent patients transported and is  therefore  primarily dependent upon the health of the us economy 
a significant or sustained downturn in the us economy could have an adverse impact on the company s bad debt expense 
aviation industry hazards and insurance limitations hazards are inherent in the aviation industry and may result in loss of life and property  thereby exposing the company to potentially substantial liability claims arising out of the operation of aircraft 
the company may also be sued in connection with medical malpractice claims arising from events occurring during a medical flight 
under hbm operating agreements  hospital customers have agreed to indemnify the company against liability arising out of medical malpractice claims and to maintain insurance covering such liability  but there can be no assurance that a hospital will not challenge the indemnification rights or will have sufficient assets or insurance coverage for full indemnity 
in cbm operations  company personnel perform medical procedures on transported patients  which may expose the company to significant direct legal exposure to medical malpractice claims 
the company maintains general liability aviation insurance  aviation product liability coverage  and medical malpractice insurance  and believes that the level of coverage is customary in the industry and adequate to protect against claims 
however  there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that present levels of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost 
a limited number of hull and liability insurance underwriters provide coverage for air medical operators 
a significant downturn in insurance market conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s cost of operations 
approximately of any increases in hull and liability insurance may be passed through to the company s hbm customers according to contract terms 
in addition  the loss of any aircraft as a result of accidents could cause both significant adverse publicity and interruption of air medical services to client hospitals  which could adversely affect the company s relationship with such hospitals and operating results 
foreign ownership federal law requires that united states air carriers be citizens of the united states 
for a corporation to qualify as a united states citizen  the president and at least two thirds of the directors and other managing officers of the corporation must be united states citizens and at least of the voting interest of the corporation must be owned or controlled by united states citizens 
if the company is unable to satisfy these requirements  operating authority from the department of transportation may be revoked 
furthermore  under certain loan agreements  an event of default occurs if less than of the voting interest is owned or controlled by united states citizens 
as of december   the company was aware of one foreign person who  according to recent public securities filings  is believed to hold approximately of outstanding common stock 
because the company is unable to control the transfer of its stock  it is unable to assure that it can remain in compliance with these requirements in the future 
acquisitions and integration the company has grown significantly through acquisitions in the past and will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future 
with any large acquisition  a significant effort is required to assimilate the operations  financial and accounting practices  and mis systems  and to integrate key personnel from the acquired business 
acquisitions may cause disruptions in company operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations 
the company may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions  profitability may suffer due to acquisition related costs or unanticipated liabilities  and the company s stock price may decrease if the financial markets consider the acquisitions to be inappropriately priced 
department of defense funding several of the projects which have historically been significant sources of revenue for the products division  including hh l and mev systems  are dependent upon department of defense funding 
failure of the us congress to approve funding for the production of additional hh l or mev units could have a material adverse impact on products division revenue 
dependence on third party suppliers the company currently obtains a substantial portion of its helicopter spare parts and components from bell and aec  because its fleet is composed primarily of bell and eurocopter aircraft  and maintains supply arrangements with other parties for its engine and related dynamic components 
based upon the manufacturing capabilities and industry contacts of bell  aec  and other suppliers  the company believes it will not be subject to material interruptions or delays in obtaining aircraft parts and components but does not have an alternative source of supply for bell  aec  and certain other aircraft parts 
failure or significant delay by these vendors in providing necessary parts could  in the absence of alternative sources of supply  have a material adverse effect on the company 
because of its dependence upon bell and aec for helicopter parts  the company may also be subject to adverse impacts from unusually high price increases which are greater than overall inflationary trends 
increases in the company s monthly and hourly flight fees billed to its hbm customers are generally limited to changes in the consumer price index 
as a result  an unusually high increase in the price of parts may not be fully passed on to the company s hbm customers 
competition hbm operations face significant competition from several national and regional air medical transportation providers for contracts with hospitals and other healthcare institutions 
cbm operations also face competition from smaller regional carriers and alternative air ambulance providers such as sheriff departments 
operators generally compete on the basis of price  safety record  accident prevention and training  and medical capability of the aircraft offered 
the company s competition in the aircraft interior design and manufacturing industry comes primarily from two companies based in the united states and one in europe 
competition is based mainly on product features  performance  price  and weight 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully for new or renewing contracts in the future 
employee recruitment and retention an important aspect of the company s operations is the ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
employees who meet these standards are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
if the company is unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees  the ability to maintain and grow the business could be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible receivables  deferred income taxes  aircraft overhaul costs  and depreciation and residual values 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under the company s operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services 
revenue and accounts receivable are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances under agreements with third party payers 
estimates of contractual allowances are initially determined based on historical discount percentages for medicare and medicaid patients and adjusted periodically based on actual discounts 
if actual discounts realized are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to contractual allowances may be required 
based on cbm flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 
revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company estimates the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
uncollectible receivables the company responds to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the credit worthiness of the patient 
uncollectible trade receivables are charged to operations using the allowance method 
estimates of uncollectible receivables are determined monthly based on historical collection rates and adjusted monthly thereafter based on actual collections 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same collection rates that it has in the past 
based on cbm net flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of in the percentage of estimated uncollectible accounts would have resulted in a change of approximately  in bad debt expense 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets and maintenance reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and records a valuation allowance for those amounts it believes are not likely to be realized 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
the company considers estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
aircraft overhaul costs the company uses the accrual method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhauls and replacements 
the cost of overhaul or replacement is estimated using published manufacturers price lists  when available  or historical experience 
this cost is accrued based on usage of the aircraft component over the period between overhauls or replacements as mandated by the parts manufacturer 
if the cost of overhaul or replacement is greater or less than estimated by management  more or less aircraft operating costs may be recorded in the period in which the price increase becomes effective or in which the aircraft component is overhauled 
depreciation and residual values in accounting for long lived assets  the company makes estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in the company s maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
all of the company s product sales and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations and notes receivable  most of which have fixed interest rates  except  outstanding against the line of credit and  in notes payable 
based on the amounts outstanding at december   the annual impact of a change in interest rates would be approximately  interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  periodically the company enters into interest rate risk hedges to minimize exposure to the effect of an increase in interest rates
