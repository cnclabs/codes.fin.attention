item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacture and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  entertainment  military  medical and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of two distinct segments the manufacture and distribution of monitors  projection systems and crts and the wholesale distribution of consumer electronic parts 
the monitor and crt segment is organized into four distinct subsegments or divisions monitors offers a complete range of crts  flat panel displays and projection systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical and industrial applications 
data display offers a complete range of crts for use in data display screen  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
home entertainment offers a complete range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
components provides replacement electron guns for crts for independent customers as well as servicing the company s internal needs 
fiscal highlights monitor division revenue the company s monitor division continued a strong growth trend 
the company now has the ability to compete in various niche markets within the defense  medical and projection display industries 
net sales within this segment increased in fiscal by  or compared to fiscal management attributes this to increased demand within the defense sector 
revenue on new government orders was  in fiscal as opposed to  in fiscal monitor division gross profit the company s monitor division sales increased  while cost of sales increased 
the company did more high volume contract work during the year  and was able to contain costs on these contracts 
cost reductions the company undertook various cost cutting measures late in fiscal that had a positive impact on fiscal operating results 
the closure of the mexico facility was based on the fact that the company was able to purchase crts from third parties cheaper then it could produce in mexico 
the company also closed two underutilized facilities and consolidated its european presence into one location in lye  england 
while consolidated net sales remained constant  cost of goods sold and operating expenses decreased  and   respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal reduction of debt during fiscal  the company reduced its total debt by  which contributed to a  decrease in interest expense from the prior year 
fiscal challenges inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected future needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crt s and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company would generally anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors due to the fact that it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining and  as manufacturers for these products discontinue production or exit the business  the company may make last time buys 
in the monitor subsegment of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by fairly rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers and accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
the wholesale distribution segment also maintains a broad range of products which contributes to a higher total inventory to be able to promptly provide those customers who are buying products  or obtaining warranty replacements  for electronic part components 
in and  the company recorded consolidated provisions of million and million  respectively  for obsolescence and overstock 
operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages which selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and subsegments

the crt division increased  or while the wholesale parts segment sales decreased  or for the comparative periods 
the net increase in crt segment sales in fiscal is attributed to growth within the monitor sub segment of  this increase is attributed in large part to stronger demand from military and defense contractors 
offsetting declines occurred in net sales of the data display  entertainment  and component parts sub segments of   and  respectively 
the net gain in monitor division sales includes increases from display systems of  aydin displays of  and xkd of  cockpit displays 
these increases reflect revenues from new contract orders received from the boeing co  lockheed martin and others during fiscal there were offsetting declines during the fiscal year of  at the lexel operation 
one of its major contracts was completed during fiscal  though lexel s other product lines  including direct view storage tubes  maintained backlogs of  at february  the other offsetting declines within the monitor division were the result of the company s decision to close two locations  megascan and wolcott  in fiscal these two locations provided net sales of  and  during the fiscal year 
management attributes the overall increase within this division to increased demand within the defense sector 
revenue on new government orders within the monitor division was  for the fiscal year 
declines in the data display division of  for fiscal compared to continue to reflect the continued sluggish replacement market for crts 
these declines are due to decreased unit sales in fiscal and not to the loss of any particular customers 
these declines are also a reflection of customer decisions to purchase new monitors with updated products and technologies instead of repairing older monitors 
the data display division reduced bulk purchases of last time buys of crts in an effort to lower the company s exposure to potential future declines in demand 
the component parts division recorded declines of  for the fiscal year ended as compared to a year ago 
electron gun and stem sales were negatively impacted by weaker demand during the fiscal year  while the company s wintron location was negatively impacted as they transition to newer technologies 
electron gun sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
within the entertainment division  sales of projection tube crts decreased  while declines in sales of replacement television crts totaled  for the year ended february  as compared to the same period a year ago 
the company is the primary supplier of replacement television crts to the domestic entertainment market 
a majority of the entertainment segment s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets to  fewer extended warranties are sold by retailers  a trend consistent with the past two fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of the manufacturer s standard warranties 
growth in this division will be impacted by the timing and number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
due to the fact that the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  can attempt to adjust quantities of certain size crts carried in stock and reduce the exposure to obsolescence 
in fiscal  retail trends continued to indicate increased sales in the mid to larger size television sets 
flat panel technology has not had a significant impact on the television replacement market 
most of the flat panel units sold within the television market are for commercial usage rather than end user consumer usage 
within the data display and monitor sub segments  there has been an impact by flat panel technology 
the company has converted manufacturing of certain subsidiaries within these sub segments to produce flat panel products 
the company s xkd and aydin subsidiaries flat panel sales for fiscal comprised approximately and of their total net sales  respectively 
as noted above  being in the replacement market  the company has the ability to see product trends and make marketing  production and stocking decisions based on those trends 
the decrease in the wholesale consumer parts segment net sales of  is attributed primarily to the declines in sales under the distribution sales agreements of parts and accessories for applica and norelco product lines 
these declines were attributed primarily to the sluggish market for original consumer electronic parts  which also negatively impacted repair and warranty sales of this segment 
gross margins consolidated gross profit margins increased to from for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  crt segment margins increased from to and the wholesale electronic parts segment margins decreased from to 
crt segment margins were impacted by a variety of factors 
the company s monitor division sales increased while cost of sales increased 
an increase of high volume orders in versus helped keep costs down by improving production efficiency as fixed costs were absorbed by greater throughput 
to a lesser extent  the data display division experienced higher margins due to the company s ability to purchase crts from cheaper outside sources  as opposed to manufacturing these products at the former mexico subsidiary 
purchases from these outside sources average approximately per crt as opposed to per crt from the former mexico subsidiary 
fiscal included write downs and write offs of inventories and manufacturing equipment of  related to the closing of operations of mexico  wolcott  megascan  and aydin uk locations 
excluding the effects of these adjustments  crt segment margins would have been for fiscal additionally  several crt locations with higher volume  particularly aydin  display systems and xkd  were able to achieve these increases without adding comparable fixed overhead and as such their margins were generally improved 
the decrease in the wholesale consumer parts segment margins is largely attributable to the overall decrease in sales related to the applica and norelco distribution agreements 
the revenues associated with these agreements include primarily handling charges and shipping income  which accounts for an approximately profit margin before the effects of offsetting operating expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from for the year ended february  to for the year ended february  included in operating expenses for fiscal were write offs of accounts receivable and other assets in the amount of  related to the mexico manufacturing location that was shut down 
a non cash charge of  was also recognized in fiscal for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment to reflect the impairment of the company s investment in the mexican subsidiary 
excluding the effects of these adjustments  operating expenses as a percentage of sales would have been for fiscal excluding the above adjustments  crt segment expenses decreased  and wholesale parts expenses increased  the closure of the three facilities  relocation of the aydin facility and other cost cutting programs implemented in late fiscal resulted in the decreased crt expense 
specifically  the closure of the wolcott  megascan and mexico operations resulted in savings of   and  of operating costs  respectively 
the savings are due to a reduction of compensation expense caused by the decrease in personnel and a reduction in overhead caused by the closures of these facilities in the prior year 
increases to the wholesale parts segment include increases to warehouse rent and labor of approximately  as well as corporate expenses totaling  allocated during fiscal that were not allocated previously 
interest expense interest expense decreased  for the year ended february  as compared to february  the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
libor and prime rates were slightly lower during the comparable periods 
overall debt decreased during the comparative periods by  which was the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the effective tax rate for was higher than the federal statutory rate due to differences between income tax and financial reporting purposes relating primarily to the effect of state income taxes and the non deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal increased  or over fiscal net sales 
crt division and wholesale parts segment sales increased  or and  or  respectively for the comparative periods 
the net increase in crt segment sales in fiscal over fiscal is attributed to growth within the monitor sub segment of  from an increase in number of orders 
offsetting declines occurred in net sales of the data display  entertainment and component parts sub segments of   and  respectively 
the net gain in monitor division sales includes increases from display systems of  lexel of  radar displays and xkd of  cockpit displays 
these increases reflect revenues from new contract orders received during fiscal there were offsetting declines of  resulting from management s decisions to shift production of high resolution medical monitors and military displays produced by the megascan and wolcott divisions  respectively 
as a result of this decision  plants were shut down and production was moved to the z axis and lexel divisions  respectively 
this movement disrupted the ability to produce these monitors and displays thereby  negatively impacting sales for these products 
z axis and lexel will handle future sales of the high resolution medical monitors and military display lines 
teltron and aydin had declines of  in comparative sales for fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  the building addition construction was completed on the birdsboro  pennsylvania teltron facility and aydin operations relocated from horsham  pennsylvania to the new teltron facility 
during the period of relocation there was a delay in the completion and shipment of orders which negatively impacted aydin s sales for the year 
declines in the data display division reflect declines primarily within the international locations including mexico  uk and netherlands 
the international location sales were down  when compared to a year ago 
the netherlands location was closed in mid fiscal and mexico was substantially closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the component parts division recorded declines of  for the fiscal year ended as compared to a year ago 
electron gun and stem sales increased  while other component parts declined  which was attributed to fewer units being sold 
within the entertainment division  sales of projection tube crts increased  but were offset by declines in sales of replacement television crts by  for the year ended february  as compared to the same period a year ago 
the increase in projection crts sales reflects the continued efforts by the company to expand its marketing of projection tubes for use in home theater and commercial applications through greater direct sales contact and internet marketing 
the company is the primary supplier of replacement television crts to the domestic entertainment market 
a majority of the entertainment segment s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets to  fewer extended warranties are sold by retailers  a trend consistent with the past two fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of the manufacturer s standard warranties 
growth in this division will be impacted by the timing and number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
due to the fact that the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  can attempt to adjust quantities of certain size crts carried in stock and reduce the exposure to obsolescence 
in fiscal  retail trends continued to indicate increased sales in the mid to larger size television sets 
flat panel technology has not had a significant impact on the television replacement market 
most of the flat panel units sold within the television market are for commercial usage rather than end user consumer usage 
within the data display and monitor sub segments  there has been an impact by flat panel technology 
the company has converted manufacturing of certain subsidiaries within these sub segments to produce flat panel products 
as noted above  being in the replacement market  the company has the ability to see product trends and make marketing  production and stocking decisions based on those trends 
as a result of declining market conditions  management shut down the monochrome crt manufacturing operations closure of mexican operations and began sourcing these products from overseas suppliers 
the increase in the wholesale consumer parts segment of  is attributed primarily to the additions of the applica  inc applica and norelco distribution agreement revenues 
these agreements authorize fox international to distribute parts and accessories for applica s black decker  profinish  quick easy  and spacemaker product lines and for norelco s product lines 
sales generated pursuant to these agreements were approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
these increases were offset by decreases of approximately  in consumer retail sales  which have been negatively impacted by general economic conditions 
gross margins consolidated gross profit margins decreased from to for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  crt segment margins decreased from to and the wholesale electronic parts segment margins increased from to 
the primary factors for the decline of crt margins were third quarter write downs and write offs of inventories and manufacturing equipment in the amount of  related to the closing of operations in mexico  wolcott  megascan and aydin uk 
these locations  which during the past few years had experienced reduced sales volume  lower margins due to aging product lines with limited potential for future product development and high overhead were part of an internal restructuring of operations 
other locations within the company with excess capacity and newer  complementary product lines were determined to be the successors of these related customer bases 
as such  certain raw materials inventories and equipment used in the manufacturing process of these closed locations were written down or off as the company has been able to more affordably source these products from overseas vendors or to shift the processes to more efficient locations within the company 
management determined it cost prohibitive to physically transfer the related materials and equipment to other company locations 
another component of the charge to cost of sales in the third quarter of fiscal was a write down of  which reflects the carrying cost of inventories previously manufactured by the mexican operation to current net realizable value as well as the write off of older or large quantity stocks 
the remainder of the decline in crt margins is attributed in part to decreases in margins within the monitor sub segment 
display systems margins declined due to the fact that products sold in the previous year included bulk inventories acquired at significantly reduced costs related to the acquisition of the marquee product line in the third quarter of fiscal as these inventories have been sold  replacement items have been purchased at current market costs and  thus  have increased the cost of items produced 
the increase in the wholesale consumer parts segment margins is largely attributable to the applica and norelco distribution agreements 
the revenues associated with these agreements include primarily handling charges and shipping income  which accounts for an approximately profit margin before the effects of offsetting operating expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended february  to for the year ended february  the crt segment operating expenses increased  for the year ended february  as compared to a year ago 
included in operating expenses is  of accounts receivable and other assets that were written off in the third quarter of fiscal related to the closure of the mexican operations 
additionally  a third quarter non cash charge of  was recognized for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment related to the mexican subsidiary that was previously carried as a component of shareholders equity 
operating expenses increased by  compared to the prior year at display systems in order to handle the increased business generated from the christie marquee product line acquired in fiscal based on expected increased sales volume  it is anticipated that these costs will continue to increase slightly in the near term and then stabilize as sales level out 
additionally  there were increased operating costs associated with the closure of the mexican operations including severance payments  as required by mexican law of  which were paid during the third and fourth quarters of the increases were offset by reductions to operating expenses of  related to the locations closed during the year 
additionally  the company adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal and  accordingly  ceased amortization of goodwill at that time 
goodwill amortization expense was  for the year ended february  the wholesale parts segment operating expenses were up  for the year ended february  as compared to a year ago  but as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
the increase includes  related to increases in delivery  labor and commission expenses associated with the applica and norelco revenue increases 
offsetting decreases of  were experienced in various operating expense line items 
the delivery and commission expenses related to the applica and norelco lines are a function of sales volume 
as sales increase it is expected that these costs will increase as well 
however  the percentage of total operating expenses to net sales as a whole should stabilize or decline slightly as certain overhead expenses are expected to remain fixed 
interest expense interest expense decreased  for the year ended february  as compared to february  the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
libor and prime rates were slightly lower during the comparable periods 
while overall debt decreased during the twelve month comparative periods by  the mix of interest rates changed 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the effective tax rate for was lower than the federal statutory rate due to differences between income tax and financial reporting purposes relating to the abandonment of mexican net operating losses  effects of state income taxes and offset by a decrease in non deductible operating expenses of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal non deductible expenses in included goodwill amortization 
management s discussion of liquidity and capital resources at february  and february   the company had total cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the company s working capital was  and  at february  and february   respectively

liquidity provided by operating activities of the company is reduced by working capital requirements  largely inventories and accounts receivables  debt service  capital expenditures  product line additions and  in fiscal  dividends 
the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be currently manufactured 
in many instances  the company s products are components of larger display systems for which immediate availability is critical for the customer

the company continues to monitor its cash and financing positions seeking to find ways to lower its interest costs and to produce positive operating cash flow 
the company examines possibilities to grow its business as opportunities present themselves  such as new sales contracts or niche acquisitions 
there could be an impact on working capital requirements to fund this growth 
as in the past  the intent is to finance such projects with operating cash flows or existing bank lines  however  more permanent sources of capital may be required in certain circumstances 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired the assets of colorado based data ray corporation s crt monitor operations 
the asset purchase included the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock and  cash to the seller for a total consideration of  cash provided by operations was  in and  in  while in   was used in operations 
working capital requirements decreased  in due primarily to improved inventory management resulting in a  decrease in inventories  net of reserves 
compared to prior years  inventory turnover has remained flat and the company has reduced its bulk purchases of last time buys of crts as it anticipates future reduced demand for these products in the replacement market 
working capital requirements increased  in due primarily to purchase requirements within the monitor subsegment related to contracts that began in the fourth quarter of that year   and to reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  from cash generated from earnings  offset somewhat by reductions in accounts receivable of  due to better collection efforts within the data display and monitor subsegments 
the average days outstanding for accounts receivable decreased from days in fiscal to days in fiscal  due to more aggressive collection efforts

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of the inventory falls below its original cost 
the age of the inventory is not as significant as is the projected demand for crts 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management is also able to observe the production trends of the oems and the new products that are being promoted 
the company wrote off approximately  of inventory in fiscal related to changing market conditions affecting primarily its southwest vacuum and fox international businesses 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately  and  at february  and february   respectively 
amounts written off in  and were   and  respectively 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when goods are shipped 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
the company offers one year and two year limited warranties on certain products 
the company records a liability for estimated warranty obligations at the date products are sold see paragraph below regarding warranty reserves 
adjustments are made as new information becomes available 
the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  which the company adopted in december  require disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
revenue from contracts that are long term in nature at the company s aydin subsidiary is recognized by the percentage of completion method cost to cost basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes in facts 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
revenue related to all other contracts is recognized upon shipment of product due to the short term nature of these contracts 
in accordance with eitf  shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs are classified in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping costs of   and  were incurred in the three years ended  and  respectively 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts on trade receivables is determined by reviewing known customer exposures and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
management reviews the valuation of accounts receivable on a monthly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and current economic conditions that might impact the collectibility of customer accounts  including such factors as bankruptcies and insolvencies 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company continually updates the history it uses to make these estimates so as to reflect the most recent information available 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  and  at february  and february   respectively 
the decrease in the allowance was due primarily to write offs of  in of previously reserved amounts 
warranty reserves warranty reserves are determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a general reserve based on historical claims experience 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
the reserve for warranty obligations was approximately  and  at february  and february   respectively 
other accounting policies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to the impairment of long lived assets require difficult judgments on matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative accounting guidance
