the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on  but not limited to  historical results  industry standards and current economic conditions  giving due consideration to materiality 
the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable  depreciable lives and valuation of real estate 
application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved 
in addition  leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned 
rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements 
the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the company s reported net income is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 
real estate upon acquisition of operating real estate properties  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 

based on these estimates  the company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities 
the company utilized methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life 
the company s investments in real estate properties are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and replacements  which improve and extend the life of the asset  are capitalized 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows buildings to years fixtures  building and leasehold improvements terms of leases or useful including certain identified intangible assets lives  whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
real estate under development on the company s consolidated balance sheets represent ground up development projects which are held for sale upon completion 
these assets are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded 
the cost of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
the company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity 
if in management s opinion  the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
a gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for real estate sales 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trend and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties  investments in joint ventures and other investments 
the company s reported net income is directly affected by management s estimate of impairments and or valuation allowances

during june  the company acquired a equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of properties 
the properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in  with the lessee having certain renewal option rights 
the company s cash equity investment was approximately million 
this equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases as amended

as of december   the remaining properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease

effects of inflation many of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
