item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  markets and sells both generic and proprietary or branded pharmaceutical products 
over the past few years  we have continued to build a deep  diverse and profitable generic product portfolio while strategically diversifying our operations by developing and acquiring several proprietary products 
while sales of generic products still account for a great majority of our overall revenues  sales of our proprietary products have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal 
table of contents generic products for many years  we have successfully utilized a strategy of developing the generic versions of branded products that possess some combination of unique factors that we believe have the effect of limiting competition for generics 
such factors include difficult formulation  complex and costly manufacturing requirements or limited raw material availability 
by targeting products with some combination of the unique factors set forth above  we believe that our generic products will  in general  be less affected by the intense and rapid pricing pressure often associated with more commodity type generic products 
as a result of this focused strategy  we have been able to successfully identify  develop and market generic products that generally have few competitors or that are able to enjoy longer periods of limited competition and thus generate profit margins higher than those often associated with commodity type generic products 
the development and launch of our generic oral contraceptive products is an example of our generic development strategy 
challenging the patents covering certain brand products is another facet of our generic product activities 
for many products  the patent provides the unique factor that we seek to identify in our product selection process 
we try to be the first company to initiate a patent challenge because in certain cases  we are able to obtain days of exclusivity for selling the generic version of the product 
for example  this occurred with fluoxetine  our generic version of eli lilly s prozac 
if we do receive exclusivity for a product  we typically experience significant revenues and profitability associated with that product for the six month exclusivity period  but at the end of that period experience significant decreases in our revenues and market share associated with the product as other generic competitors enter the market 
this happened with our fluoxetine product after expiration of our generic exclusivity period 
our record of successfully resolving patent challenges has contributed to our growth  but has created periods of revenue and earnings volatility and will likely do so in the future 
despite the volatility  challenging patents continues to be an important component of our generic product strategy 
macroeconomic factors favoring generic products have also helped to grow sales 
the aging population  rising health care costs and the vigilance of health care providers  insurance companies and others to lower such costs have helped drive an increase in the substitution of lower cost generic products for higher cost brand products 
as evidence of this  the percentage of overall prescriptions filled with generic products grew from in to by  and is predicted to continue to rise in the future 
proprietary products to help diversify our long term opportunities  we initiated a program more than five years ago to develop and market proprietary pharmaceutical products 
we formalized this program in by establishing duramed research and today have over professionals dedicated to the development of a wide range of proprietary products focused primarily on women s healthcare products 
our growth in proprietary product sales has been accomplished through product acquisitions and through the november launch of our first internally developed proprietary product  seasonale  a novel extended cycle oral contraceptive 
our proprietary products are promoted directly to physicians by our person sales force and are sold under the duramed label 
competition as with any successful business  the greatest challenge we face is continuing to stay ahead of the competition  both for generic and proprietary products 
our successful generic product strategy has attracted new competitors seeking to launch competing generic products 
for example  we know that other generic pharmaceutical companies have recently started developing and marketing competing generic oral contraceptives in order to capture some of our market share 
also  as a challenge to the value of our patent challenge strategy  brand pharmaceutical companies have begun to partner with certain generic drug companies to license a so called authorized generic to the generic drug company 

table of contents the use of authorized generics by certain brand and generic companies undermines the value of the day exclusivity period enjoyed by the first company to file an anda containing a paragraph iv certification by providing another generic drug company with the ability to have the product on the market at the same time 
finally  as our proprietary pharmaceutical products grow  we anticipate that competing generic pharmaceutical companies will challenge the patents protecting our branded products 
for example  our seasonale extended cycle oral contraceptive product was recently targeted for a patent challenge by one of our principal competitors 
to address these and other challenges  we continue to invest aggressively in research and development  develop and launch new generic and proprietary products and maintain an active acquisition and licensing effort to complement our internal development activities 
comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  s in millions the following table sets forth revenue data for the fiscal years ended june  and change in millions generic products distributed alternative brands ciprofloxacin tamoxifen oral contraceptives other generic total generic products proprietary products total product sales development and other revenue total revenues reflects sales of tamoxifen product acquired from innovator 
includes sales of tamoxifen product manufactured by barr 
distributed alternative brands are distributed by us under terms of agreements entered into as part of patent challenge settlements 
therefore  for reporting purposes  they are classified under generic products 
revenues product sales product sales for the year ended june  increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to the sales of our distributed version of ciprofloxacin and to increased sales of our generic and proprietary products  which more than offset the large decline in sales of our distributed version of tamoxifen 
generic products ciprofloxacin on june   we began distributing ciprofloxacin hydrochloride tablets and oral suspension pursuant to a license from bayer obtained under a settlement of a patent challenge we initiated against bayer s cipro antibiotic 
in september  we signed an amended supply agreement with bayer that enabled us to distribute ciprofloxacin during and after bayer s period of pediatric exclusivity  which ended on june  as a result  ciprofloxacin was our largest selling product in fiscal we have shared one half of our profits  as defined  from the sale of ciprofloxacin with aventis  the contractual successor to our partner in the cipro patent challenge 
table of contents case 
bayer s period of pediatric exclusivity expired on june  and  as we expected  several other competing ciprofloxacin products were launched 
as a result of these additional competitors  our market share and product pricing declined dramatically thereby lowering our sales of ciprofloxacin in the quarter ended june  compared to earlier quarters in the fiscal year 
our sales of ciprofloxacin are expected to be less than million in fiscal tamoxifen for most of the first six months of fiscal we sold a distributed version of tamoxifen that we purchased from astrazeneca under the terms of a supply and distribution agreement entered into as part of a patent challenge settlement 
this agreement ended in december we began selling our manufactured tamoxifen product when astrazeneca s pediatric exclusivity for nolvadex ended on february  therefore  we recorded no sales from a distributed version of tamoxifen in fiscal oral contraceptives the following table sets forth oral contraceptive data for the fiscal years ended june  and change in millions oral contraceptive sales number of marketed products at end of period sales of our generic oral contraceptive products increased throughout fiscal and by june  we became the largest supplier of oral contraceptives in the us as determined by prescription market share data provided by ims america 
the revenue growth in fiscal was fueled by increasing volumes resulting from growth in market share by products launched in prior periods and first year sales of new generic oral contraceptives launched during fiscal the largest new product addition was tri sprintec  our generic equivalent to ortho s tri cyclen oral contraceptive 
we launched tri sprintec in december in accordance with the terms of a patent challenge settlement we entered into with ortho 
since the beginning of fiscal  sales of our generic oral contraceptive products have more than quadrupled 
this growth has been fueled by new product launches  the addition of new customers and by increasing rates of generic substitution 
at the end of fiscal  our generic oral contraceptive portfolio totaled products representing a generic version of nearly all oral contraceptive products on the market 
in addition  the percentage of prescriptions filled with a generic version  the generic substitution rate  for many of our oral contraceptives reached by the end of the year 
as a result  while we believe the substitution rates for many of these products will eventually reach or more over the next months  we will not be able to gain market share as rapidly as we have over the past few years 
we have also recently noted a decline in the total number of prescriptions being written for the branded versions of many of our generic oral contraceptives 
this decline is common for products that have generic equivalents available to consumers because demand for pharmaceutical products and the resulting prescriptions are significantly influenced by brand companies use of promotional activities  including the use of sales representatives to market products directly to physicians 
when a generic version of a product is launched  brand companies substantially reduce or eliminate sales and promotion programs and refocus those efforts on other products that are not subject to generic competition 
in the contraceptive market  the brand companies impacted by the launch of our generics have either stopped sales and promotional activities or have shifted their efforts to other contraceptive products which still enjoy patent protection  including low dose oral contraceptives and patch products 
in fiscal  we were able to offset the impact of these declining prescriptions with growth in our market share  but as we previously discussed  our rate of growth in the future will slow 

table of contents finally  over the past three years  the generic oral contraceptive market has included us and only one other generic competitor 
however  two additional competitors have entered during the second half of fiscal as a result  we anticipate some loss of market share and lower pricing on certain oral contraceptive products during fiscal despite these challenges  we believe our generic oral contraceptive sales will increase in fiscal compared to though at a much lower growth rate than we experienced during the past year 
our forecast for fiscal primarily reflects our expectations that sales of tri sprintec will increase year over year due to a full year contribution in fiscal  most of our products will continue to gain additional market share through increased generic substitution which will offset the negative effects of additional market competitors and declining prescriptions for some of these products  in fiscal  we will receive approval for and launch two new oral contraceptive products  and we will add new customers during the year 
generic products other sales of other generic products increased approximately in fiscal as compared to the prior year period  primarily due to sales of our mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablet the generic equivalent of akzo nobel and organon  inc s remeron soltab  which we launched in december  and sales of claravis a generic equivalent of roche pharmaceutical s accutane  which we launched in may these increases were partially offset by a significant decline in sales of our dextro salt combo product a generic equivalent of shire richwood  inc s adderall due to lower pricing and lower volumes resulting from the entry of two additional generic competitors 
proprietary products sales of our proprietary products more than doubled in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this increase relates primarily to sales from the four products we purchased from wyeth in june  the launch of seasonale  our extended cycle oral contraceptive  increased sales of cenestin  and sales of loestrin and loestrin fe  which we purchased from galen chemicals limited galen in march in september we received approval for our seasonale extended cycle oral contraceptive 
we began promoting seasonale directly to physicians in november and initiated our direct to consumer television and print advertising program during our fourth quarter 
since we launched seasonale  demand for the product as measured by prescription data obtained from ims america has risen from  per week for the week ended december  to  for the week ended july  the consistent increases in number of prescriptions drives our expectation that sales of seasonale will be significantly higher in fiscal than they were in fiscal sales of cenestin increased at a higher than expected rate of in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to year over year price increases of approximately  the launch of one additional strength and customer buying patterns  which more than offset a decline in cenestin prescriptions 
prescription declines began after the results of the women s health initiative whi study was published in july and continued through fiscal however  recent prescription data suggests this decline may be slowing or stopping 
since july  cenestin prescriptions have declined at a slower rate than those written for competing conjugated estrogen products  thus allowing us to increase our market share to as of june  compared to as of june  price increases are expected to continue in fiscal  though they are not expected to be as significant as they were in fiscal therefore  while we expect fiscal cenestin sales to be relatively consistent with fiscal levels  the change in cenestin sales in fiscal will depend on several factors including prescription trends  customer inventory levels and buying patterns and the extent of additional price increases 

table of contents cost of sales our cost of sales includes our acquisition cost for the distributed versions of products we purchase from third parties  our manufacturing and packaging costs for products we manufacture  profit sharing payments made to raw material suppliers and any changes to our inventory reserve 
product mix plays a significant role in our quarterly and annual overall gross margin percentage 
though this is true for many companies  our overall margins have been substantially impacted by the contribution from sales of our distributed versions of products such as tamoxifen and ciprofloxacin  which were manufactured for us by the innovator and distributed by us under the terms of patent challenge settlement agreements 
the following table sets forth cost of sales data in dollars as well as the resulting gross margins  for the two years ended june  and change in millions cost of sales generic products gross margin proprietary products gross margin total cost of sales gross margin includes cost of sales of distributed alternative brand products 
the increase in total cost of sales  on a dollar basis  for year ended june   as compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased product sales  principally relating to ciprofloxacin 
margins on our generic products declined slightly in fiscal due mainly to the higher percentage of ciprofloxacin sales in fiscal compared to fiscal as a distributed product that has a profit split paid to our partner  ciprofloxacin has a higher cost of sales and a lower margin than our other products 
margins on our proprietary products declined in fiscal compared to fiscal as increased sales of somewhat lower margin products  including the products acquired from wyeth in late fiscal  more than offset higher sales of cenestin and seasonale 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative expense data for the two years ended june  and change in millions selling  general and administrative charges included in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  included charges related to strategic acquisitions or other similar activities including a million valuation allowance we established in september for our loans to natural biologics  llc  the raw material supplier for our generic equine based conjugated estrogens product  as the result of an unfavorable court decision rendered in september  the 
table of contents february write off of million associated with the acquisition of certain emergency contraception assets from gynetics  inc  an arbitration panel s decision in june to award solvay pharmaceuticals  inc million in damages on a claim that we improperly terminated an agreement with solvay  and an million charge in june related to costs associated with our settlement of the estrostep and femhrt patent challenge litigation against galen 
included in the year ended june  is a million contingent attorney fee paid in connection with a litigation settlement with wyeth 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to increased marketing costs for seasonale  higher costs associated with the nearly doubling of our women s healthcare sales force  higher legal costs  primarily related to patent matters  the solvay arbitration and product liability matters  and increased information technology costs  including consulting costs related to the initial phases of designing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system 
research and development the following table sets forth research and development expenses for the two years ended june  and change in millions research and development charges included in research and development for the year ended june  our total research and development costs reflected charges relating to strategic acquisitions or similar activities including a write off of million in march resulting from our agreement to acquire schering s rights and obligations under a product development and license agreement that had been capitalized at the time of our acquisition of enhance pharmaceuticals  inc in june  a write off of million for in process research and development acquired in connection with our acquisition of women s capital corporation in february  and the write off of million of in process research and development costs in connection with our purchase of substantially all of the assets of endeavor pharmaceuticals  inc in november included in the year ended june  is a million write off of in process research and development associated with our june purchase from wyeth of four products and the product rights to an oral contraceptive in development 
the remaining increase in research and development for the year ended june  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher third party development costs  higher headcount costs  and higher raw material costs in support of internal development projects 
income taxes the following table sets forth income tax expense and the resulting effective tax rate stated as a percentage of pre tax income for the two years ended june  and change in millions income tax expense effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by the write off of in process research and development costs associated with our february acquisition of women s capital corporation  which was not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes 
offsetting the unfavorable impact of the in process research and development costs was a favorable impact of a tax benefit of million related to the completion of several tax audits and the internal revenue service s approval of a change in our method of computing certain tax credits 
comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  s in millions 
table of contents the following table sets forth revenue data for the fiscal years ended june  and change in millions generic products distributed alternative brands ciprofloxacin n a tamoxifen oral contraceptives other generic total generic products proprietary products total product sales development and other revenue total revenues reflects sales of tamoxifen product acquired from innovator 
includes sales of tamoxifen product manufactured by barr 
distributed alternative brands are distributed by us under terms of agreements entered into as part of patent challenge settlements 
therefore  for reporting purposes  they are classified under generic products 
revenues product sales product sales for fiscal declined from the prior year primarily due to significant decreases in sales of tamoxifen and fluoxetine 
fluoxetine sales  which are included in the other generic line in the table above  accounted for million of product sales in fiscal  down from million in fiscal  while our distributed version of tamoxifen accounted for million of product sales in fiscal  down from million in fiscal partially offsetting these declines were higher sales of our generic oral contraceptive products and sales from the june launch of our distributed version of ciprofloxacin 
generic products ciprofloxacin in june we began shipping ciprofloxacin hydrochloride pursuant to a license from bayer 
under a settlement of a patent challenge we initiated against bayer s cipro antibiotic  we purchased directly from bayer ciprofloxacin products that were manufactured under bayer s new drug application for cipro and marketed them under our label 
we had the non exclusive right to distribute the ciprofloxacin products until bayer s patent protecting cipro expired in december on june   we began distributing ciprofloxacin pursuant to the terms of the settlement and recorded sales of million for the period from june  to june  we share one half of our profits from the sale of ciprofloxacin  as defined  with aventis  the contractual successor to our joint venture partner in the cipro patent challenge case 
tamoxifen sales of our distributed version of tamoxifen decreased substantially in fiscal during the quarter ended december   we sold our remaining distributed tamoxifen inventory previously purchased from astrazeneca 
astrazeneca s pediatric exclusivity for its nolvadex brand version of tamoxifen ended on february  we were unable to supply distributed tamoxifen to our customers after the depletion of our inventory purchased from astrazeneca until we launched our manufactured tamoxifen product at the expiration of 
table of contents astrazeneca s pediatric exclusivity period 
at that time  several other generic competitors launched tamoxifen products  causing the price to decline and causing us to lose market share 
sales of our manufactured version of tamoxifen totaled less than million during fiscal oral contraceptives the following table sets forth oral contraceptive data for the fiscal years ended june  and change in millions oral contraceptive sales number of marketed products at end of period the increase in sales of oral contraceptives reflected increasing market shares for existing products  including our apri  aviane  kariva and nortrel products  and sales of seven new oral contraceptive products launched during fiscal generic products other in august  we launched our fluoxetine mg capsule with days of exclusivity as the only generic manufacturer 
sales of fluoxetine were million for fiscal  constituting approximately of product sales in that year 
on january   our day generic exclusivity period ended and  as expected  the fda approved several other competing fluoxetine products 
as a result  the selling price declined dramatically and we lost market share to competing products  causing our sales and profits from fluoxetine to be substantially lower than those earned during the exclusivity period 
somewhat offsetting the decline in fluoxetine sales were higher sales of our dextro salt combo product 
we launched our dextro salt combo product in february as the first generic manufacturer to enter the market 
sales of our dextro salt combo product in fiscal were higher than in fiscal due to the inclusion of a full year of sales in our fiscal results compared with approximately four months of sales in fiscal partially offsetting this full year contribution were lower prices in fiscal due to the entry of competitors into the market 
proprietary products lower proprietary product sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily the result of lower sales of cenestin 
sales of cenestin declined approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decline in cenestin sales was due to declining cenestin prescriptions  which more than offset higher prices for the product  and was consistent with reduced sales of several prominent hormone therapy products due to the july  release of the findings of the women s health initiative whi study 
the whi study involved the long term usage of estrogen and progestin in healthy post menopausal women 
a portion of the study  which evaluated the use of a combination of conjugated equine estrogens and the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate  was stopped early by the study s sponsor  because of increased health risks  which the study sponsor felt outweighed the specified long term benefits 
although cenestin is not a combination product and was not part of the whi study  the findings negatively impacted nearly all hormone therapy products 
though we experienced a decline in our cenestin prescriptions  our decline was not as significant as other larger products in the hormone therapy market and  as a result  our market share increased 
cost of sales 
table of contents the following table sets forth cost of sales data in dollars as well as the resulting gross margins for the two years ended june  and change in millions cost of sales generic products gross margin proprietary products gross margin total cost of sales gross margin includes cost of sales of distributed alternative brand products 
the decrease in cost of sales  on a dollar basis  was primarily due to lower sales of fluoxetine and tamoxifen 
cost of sales includes the profit split paid to apotex  inc  our partner in the fluoxetine patent challenge  and royalties on certain other products paid to certain of our raw material suppliers 
margins on our generic products increased in fiscal due mainly to the fact that higher margin products constituted a larger portion of total product sales in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  as a percentage of total product sales  fluoxetine  which is subject to a profit split with a partner  decreased from fiscal to fiscal margins on our proprietary products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to the reduction in profit splits paid on our viaspan organ preservation agent 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative expense data for the two years ended june  and change in millions selling  general and administrative charges included in selling  general and administrative n a the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to significant costs incurred for pre launch activities related to seasonale  which we launched in fiscal  and increased marketing and selling expenses for cenestin 
also contributing to the increase were the amortization of intangible assets and higher legal costs  including a charge of million relating to a contingent attorney fee paid in connection with a litigation settlement with wyeth 
partially offsetting these increases were somewhat lower marketing and administrative costs associated with synergies achieved as a result of the integration of duramed 
research and development expense the following table sets forth research and development expenses for the two years ended june  and 
table of contents change in millions research and development the increase in research and development expenses reflected higher headcount and development costs in our proprietary development program  including costs associated with our vaginal ring product  as well as increased expenditures associated with the development of the adenovirus vaccine for the us department of defense 
proceeds from patent challenge settlement under the terms of the contingent supply agreement we entered into with bayer to settle our cipro patent challenge litigation  bayer had the option to either supply us with ciprofloxacin at a predetermined discount for resale or make quarterly cash payments to us 
until june   bayer elected to make payments to us rather than supply us with ciprofloxacin 
accordingly  we recognized proceeds from patent challenge settlement of million for fiscal and million for fiscal fiscal was the last year we recognized proceeds from the cipro patent challenge 
income taxes the following table sets forth income tax expense and the resulting effective tax rate stated as a percentage of pre tax income for the two years ended june  and change in millions income tax expense effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was due primarily to the increase in certain tax credits  the recognition of a deferred tax asset resulting from the identification of additional deductible state operating losses incurred in prior years and the reversal of certain valuation allowances previously established by duramed 
liquidity and capital resources overview the following table highlights selected balance sheet and cash flow components as of june  and 
table of contents change s in millions cash cash equivalents marketable securities short term long term debt capital lease obligations short term long term cash flow from operations working capital our primary source of cash from operations is the collection of accounts receivable related to product sales and our primary uses of cash include funding our research and development programs  marketing and selling our proprietary and generic products  financing the production of inventories  funding capital projects and investing in business development activities 
our cash flows from operations have been more than sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures and business development activities 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalents balances have increased 
investment in marketable securities during fiscal  we increased our investments in short and long term marketable securities to provide a greater return on our cash balances 
our investments in marketable securities are governed by our investment policy which seeks to optimize our returns while preserving our capital  maintaining adequate liquidity and investing in tax advantaged securities  as appropriate 
our short term portfolio includes million in market auction debt securities that are readily convertible into cash at par value with maturity dates ranging from july to february while our long term portfolio includes million of municipal and corporate debt securities with maturity dates ranging from july to june operating activities our operating cash flows have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  though over the past couple of years  our operating cash flow levels have fluctuated and are subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties that impact our earnings 
our operating cash in fiscal was generated principally by our net earnings  adjusted for in process research and development charges totaling million and non cash charges including depreciation and amortization which more than offset increases in certain of our working capital components 
working capital working capital as of june  and consisted of the following 
table of contents change in millions cash cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories prepaid other current assets subtotal accounts payable accrued liabilities income taxes payable current portion of long term debt capital leases subtotal working capital working capital increased from june  to june  accounts receivable were lower at june  primarily due to the balance at june  being unusually high because we launched ciprofloxacin in mid june by june   we had not collected any of the receivables associated with the sales from our ciprofloxacin launch 
in contrast  additional competitors entered the generic ciprofloxacin market in early june  causing our sales of ciprofloxacin in the month of june and for the quarter ended june to decline significantly compared to last year s fourth quarter 
the decline in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to a reduction in accounts payable owed to bayer for ciprofloxacin purchases  partially offset by higher accrued liabilities resulting from current amounts due solvay under the arbitration award and current amounts of revenue deferred from a product licensing agreement we entered into in april  which we will recognize over a five year period 
prepaid and other current assets increased from june  to june   primarily reflecting a receivable of approximately million due from bayer as a price adjustment to reduce the cost of our june inventory of ciprofloxacin purchased from bayer during the second half of our fiscal year 
cash flows in fiscal were favorably impacted by approximately million in part due to a change in the method used to calculate the annual limitation under section of the internal revenue code 
as a result of this change  we have utilized all of the federal net operating losses incurred by duramed pharmaceuticals  inc prior to our merger with duramed in october in june  an arbitration panel ruled against the company in its arbitration with solvay pharmaceuticals and awarded solvay million in damages 
this award is required to be paid out in six installments 
the first payment of million was made on july  and five additional quarterly payments of million will be due over the five quarters ending october  we have filed a petition with the us district court in cincinnati seeking to vacate the award 
seasonale royalty our current royalty obligation to the seasonale patent holder is a perpetual royalty based on a percentage of net profits  as defined 
however  our license agreement gives us the option  at any time prior to september  to make a one time payment of approximately million to the patent holder in lieu of future royalty payments 
we expect to exercise this option 

table of contents investing activities capital expenditures during the three fiscal years ended june   we have invested approximately million in upgrades and expansions to our property  plant and equipment 
this investment has significantly expanded our production  laboratory  warehouse and distribution capacity in our facilities and was designed to help ensure that we have the facilities necessary to manufacture  test  package and distribute our current and future products 
during the twelve months ended june   we invested million in capital projects and expect that our capital investments will be between million and million over the next twelve months 
our estimate reflects lower spending on our facility expansion programs and higher investments in information technology projects including the purchase and implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
we believe we can continue funding our capital requirements using cash provided by operations 
however  we may consider obtaining long term debt to finance a portion of our projects 
we believe we have the capital structure and cash flow to complete any such financing 
strategic transactions our investment in strategic product and company acquisitions was million in fiscal and approximately million for the three years ended june  in fiscal  these transactions included the acquisition of women s capital corporation  certain assets of gynetics  inc  substantially all the assets of endeavor pharmaceuticals  inc 
and certain product rights from galen 
we continuously evaluate strategic transactions to further improve our business and long range prospects and expect to make additional investments over the next twelve months 
we are unable to predict the timing of potential transactions  though the cash required to complete them could equal or exceed the average amounts invested over the past three years 
these transactions typically range from product development and license agreements to asset or corporate acquisitions 
loans to natural biologics in fiscal  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with natural biologics  llc natural biologics  the raw material supplier for our generic equine based conjugated estrogens product for which we filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda in june in september  as a result of an adverse legal decision in a lawsuit brought by wyeth against natural biologics  we reserved million for all loans made to natural biologics since the inception of our loan agreement 
natural biologics is appealing the decision and  pending the outcome of the appeal  we agreed to provide natural biologics advances totaling million over four quarters beginning in may  to defray the costs of maintaining the existing conjugated estrogen raw material 
we are fully reserving these advances 
if natural biologics prevails on its appeal  we expect to resume making loans to natural biologics on the terms contained in our loan agreement 
in fiscal  the company also entered into a development  manufacturing and distribution agreement with natural biologics which could obligate the company to make milestone payments totaling an additional million to natural biologics based on achieving certain legal and product approval milestones  including the approval of a generic product 
investment in venture funds during the second quarter of fiscal  we made investments  as a limited partner  in two separate venture capital funds as part of our continuing efforts to identify new products  new technologies and new licensing opportunities 
we have committed up to a total of million for each of these funds over a five and year period  as defined by each fund 
as of august   we have contributed a total of million to these funds 

table of contents financing activities debt repayments and credit availability debt balances decreased by approximately million from june  to june  reflecting principal repayments of million  offset by our issuance of a million note to finance a portion of our acquisition of women s capital corporation 
scheduled principal repayments on existing debt will be million during the next twelve months 
we have a million revolving credit facility that expires on february  we currently have million available under this facility due to the issuance of a million letter of credit in support of our product liability self insurance program 
we expect to replace the existing revolving credit facility with a larger one before it expires in february proceeds from equity transactions over the three years ending june   we received proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of employee stock options and share purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
the timing and sustainability of such proceeds are very difficult to predict because they are highly dependent upon our stock price  which can be volatile 
during march  holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  consisting of  shares at per share and  shares at per share  exercised the warrants  in full  through a cashless exercise 
as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock 
we did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of the shares but we expect to realize a cash tax benefit of approximately million from this transaction 
share repurchase program in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  pursuant to terms we deem appropriate and at such times as we designate through the end of december the company will hold repurchased shares as treasury shares and may use them for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to acquisition related transactions and for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options 
funding of employee savings plan on september   we committed to make a minimum aggregate contribution of million to the barr pharmaceuticals  inc savings and retirement plan k plan for the fiscal year ending june  we fully funded the contribution commitment during the fiscal year 
we expect to make a similar minimum contribution commitment in september for fiscal sufficiency of cash resources we believe our current cash and investment balances  cash flows from operations and un drawn amounts under our revolving credit facility are adequate to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures and to capitalize on strategic opportunities as they arise 
we have and will continue to evaluate our capital structure as part of our goal to promote long term shareholder value 
to the extent that additional capital resources are required  we believe that such capital may be raised by additional bank borrowings or debt offerings or other means 

table of contents contractual obligations payments due by period for our contractual obligations at june  are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year to years to years thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations venture funds commitment annual interest on fixed rate debt other long term liabilities total purchase obligations consist mainly of commitments for raw materials used in our manufacturing and research and development operations 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying the accounting policies most critical to our financial statements have a significant impact on our reported results 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and or require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  our most critical policies are the following revenue recognition and related provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances  inventories and related inventory reserves  deferred taxes  contingencies  and the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time the estimates and assumptions were made 
we review the factors that influence our estimates and  if necessary  adjust them 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition and sales reserves and allowances we recognize revenue from product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to our customers and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
we simultaneously record estimates for price adjustments including shelf stock adjustments  product returns  chargebacks  rebates  including medicaid rebates  prompt payment discounts and other sales allowances 
accruals for these estimates reduce our reported product sales and accounts receivable and  in the case of medicaid rebates  are recorded in our accrued liabilities 
if we believe we have not met the requirements for recognizing revenue  we defer the recognition of product sales 
in november  we launched our extended cycle oral contraceptive product  seasonale  but did not recognize the revenue immediately 
we monitored seasonale s prescription data and other information during the months following our launch and recognized revenues once we concluded that the product had achieved market acceptance 
all of the revenues associated with the initial launch were recognized by the end of the year 
provisions for estimated discounts  rebates  promotional and other credits require a lower degree of subjectivity and are less complex in nature  yet combined  they represent a significant portion of the overall provisions 
other provisions  such as shelf stock adjustments  returns and chargebacks  require more subjective judgments 
these provisions are discussed in further detail below 
shelf stock adjustments shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products and are intended to reduce a customer s inventory cost to better reflect current market prices 
the determination to grant a shelf stock credit to a customer following a price decrease is usually at our discretion rather than contractually required 
we record allowances for shelf stock adjustments at the time we sell products that we 
table of contents determine will be subject to a price decrease or when market conditions indicate that a shelf stock adjustment is necessary to facilitate the sell through of our product 
when deciding whether to record a reserve for a shelf stock adjustment  we analyze several variables  including the estimated launch date of a competing product  the estimated decline in market price and estimated levels of inventory held by our customers at the time of the decrease in market price 
as a result  a shelf stock adjustment depends on a product s unique facts and circumstances 
returns consistent with industry practice  we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date 
our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns 
additionally  we consider factors including product dating and expiration period when we establish our provision for returns 
chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
we market and sell products directly to wholesalers  distributors  warehousing pharmacy chains  mail order pharmacies and other direct purchasing groups 
we also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies  non warehousing chains  managed care organizations  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
we enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products 
these indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices 
alternatively  we may pre authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers 
under either arrangement  we provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler s invoice price 
such credit is called a chargeback 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers  as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
accounts receivable are presented net of allowances related to the above provisions of million at june  and million at june  accrued liabilities include million and million at june  and  respectively  for estimated medicaid rebates 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis or market and consist of finished goods purchased from third party manufacturers and held for distribution  as well as raw materials  work in process and finished goods manufactured by us 
we also capitalize inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval and or resolution of patent infringement litigation  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
if final regulatory approval for such products is denied or delayed  or if patent litigation is not resolved in our favor  or if a patent litigation decision is delayed  we may be required to expense such previously capitalized costs 
we establish reserves for our inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we review our inventory for products close to expiration and therefore not expected to be sold  for products that have reached their expiration date and for products that are not expected to be saleable based on our quality assurance and control standards 
the reserve for these products is equal to all or a portion of the cost of the inventory based on the specific facts and circumstances 
in evaluating whether inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of product inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we record provisions for inventory reserves as part of cost of sales 
inventories are presented net of reserves of million at june  and million at june  deferred taxes income taxes are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets  which are more likely than not to be unrealized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our assessment of whether it is more likely 
table of contents than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
we review our internal sales forecasts and pre tax earnings estimates to make our assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event we determine that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance 
if that assessment changes  we would record a benefit on the consolidated statement of earnings 
deferred income taxes are presented net of a valuation allowance of million at june  and million at june  contingencies we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business  including patent  product liability and other litigation and contingencies 
legal fees and other costs related to such litigation and contingencies are expensed as incurred 
additionally  we assess  in consultation with counsel  the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies 
reserves are recorded when we determine that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable 
we are primarily self insured for potential product liability claims on products sold on or after september   and we maintain self insured retentions and deductibles on policies covering periods prior to september  we maintain a self insurance reserve  which provides an estimate of our potential product liability claims not covered by our insurance and an estimate of the future cost of incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
we develop these estimates in consultation with outside counsel  our insurance consultants and an independent actuary 
the self insurance reserve does not include estimated administrative or defense costs  which are expensed as incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquisitions  we determine the amounts assigned to goodwill and other intangibles based on purchase price allocations 
these allocations  including an assessment of the estimated useful lives of intangible assets  have been performed by qualified independent appraisers using generally accepted valuation methodologies 
the valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated future cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  which considers various characteristics of the asset  including projected cash flows 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
as a result of our acquisitions  we included goodwill of million on our balance sheet as of june  and million as of june  as a result of our acquisition of product rights and related intangibles and certain product licenses  we have included million and million as other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  on our balance sheet as of june  and june   respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  sfas clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in sfas no 
 clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to the language used in fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
we currently have no involvement with derivative financial 
table of contents instruments  and therefore the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas modifies the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position and affects an issuer s accounting for mandatorily redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets  instruments  other than outstanding shares  that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  or obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominately to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuer s shares 
in addition to its requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments within its scope  sfas also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling those instruments and the capital structure of entities  all of whose shares are mandatorily redeemable 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we may have obligations for environmental safety and clean up under various state  local and federal laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as superfund 
based on information currently available  environmental expenditures have not had  and are not anticipated to have  any material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation  seasonality inflation has had only a minimal impact on our operations in recent years 
similarly  our business is generally not affected by seasonality

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of approximately million and debt instruments of approximately million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents and market auction debt securities primarily classified as available for sale 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio in a variety of high credit quality debt securities  including us government  municipal and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
over of our portfolio matures in less than three months 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates the market value at june  and the value at maturity 
because our investments consist of cash equivalents and market auction debt securities  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
approximately of our debt instruments at june  are subject to fixed interest rates and principal payments 
the related note purchase agreements permit us to prepay these notes prior to their scheduled maturity  but may require us to pay a prepayment fee based on market rates at the time of prepayment 
the remaining of debt instruments are primarily subject to variable interest rates based on the prime rate or libor and have fixed principal payments 
the fair value of all debt instruments is approximately million at june  in addition  borrowings under our million unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on the 
table of contents prime rate  the federal funds rate or libor 
as of june   there was approximately million available under this facility due to the issuance of a million letter of credit in support of our finite risk insurance program 
we do not believe that any market risk inherent in our debt instruments is likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  as of june   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates  based on the june  balance  would reduce our annual net income by approximately thousand 
any future gains or losses may differ materially from this hypothetical amount based on the timing and amount of actual interest rate changes and the actual term loan balance
