item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  sell and support advanced thermal processing systems used primarily for semiconductor packaging  printed circuit boards pcb assembly and advanced materials processing 
in addition  we produce custom thermal systems for a variety of specialty applications for a wide range of temperatures 
we derive our net sales from customers around the world 
our customers include large multinational oem original equipment manufacturers and ems electronic manufacturing service providers requiring advanced thermal processing equipment solutions 
in  net sales to our five largest customers accounted for of our total net sales 
our net sales in were dispersed worldwide  with approximately to customers in the united states  to asia pacific customers  to european customers and to other americas 
over the past three years  the percentage of our net sales to international customers was in  in and in critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of those accounting policies that the company deems to be critical that is  they are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they reflect management s reliance on estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as updated by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
under these guidelines  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and payment is reasonably assured 
under these requirements  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer use  revenues are recognized upon acceptance 
furthermore  revenues for products that require installation for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon shipment with estimated installation and warranty costs accrued 
applying the requirements of sab no 
to future sales arrangements used in the company s thermal processing equipment sales may result in the deferral of the revenue for some equipment sales 
the company continues to evaluate the impact that sab no 
might have on its sales transactions 
however  there will be no impact on the company s cash flows from operations as a result of any change 
the company also has certain sales transactions for products  which are not completed within the normal operating cycle of the business 
it is the company s policy to account for these transactions using the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition purposes when all of the following criteria exist 
the company has received the customer s purchase order or entered into a legally binding contract 
the customer is credit worthy and collection is probable or customer prepayments are required at product completion milestones or specific dates 
the sales value of the product to be delivered is significant in amount when compared to the company s other products 
product costs can be reasonably estimated  there is no major technological uncertainty and the total engineering  material procurement  product assembly and test cycle time extend over a period of six months or longer 
under the percentage completion method  revenues and gross margins to date are recognized based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the latest estimate of total costs to complete the product as a percentage of the total contract revenue for the product 
revisions in costs and gross margin percentage estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts causing the revision become known 
provisions for total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  if any  are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
inventory valuation the company s inventories consist of material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company determines the cost of inventory based on the first in  first out method fifo 
the company regularly reviews the quantity of inventories on hand and compares these quantities to the expected usage of each applicable product or product line 
the company s inventories are adjusted in value to the lower of costs and or net realizable value 
since the value of the company s inventories depends in part on the company s estimates of each product s net realizable value  adjustments may be needed to reflect changes in valuation 
any adjustments the company is required to make to lower the value of the inventories are recorded as a charge to cost of revenue 
for more information on the company s inventory valuation  please see note to the financial statements included in this report
