management formally reviews the loan portfolio  the allowance for loan and lease losses and the components of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit risk on a monthly basis throughout the year 
such review takes into consideration the company s assessment of the financial condition of the borrowers  and the company s internal risk grading of the borrowers  fair value of the collateral  level of delinquencies  historical loss experience by loan category  industrial trends and the impact of local and national economic conditions 
management also evaluates the allowance for loan and lease losses  and the components of the allowance for loan and lease losses throughout the year  based on changes in external conditions and other factors  and makes changes to the allowance accordingly 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a monthly basis 
the methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following two criteria the establishment of allowance amounts for all specifically identified criticized loans  including those arising from business combinations  that have been designated as requiring attention by management s internal loan review program 
the establishment of allowances for pools of homogenous types of loans not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  consumer loans  and credit card accounts  based upon historical loss rates 
an allocation of the allowance for the non criticized loans in each portfolio is determined based upon the historical average loss experience of those portfolios 
consideration is also given to the changed risk profile brought about by the aforementioned business combinations  customer knowledge  the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending work out and collection staffs  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions and the concentration of real estate related loans located within the company s footprint

interest and liquidity rate sensitivity management the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for the safety of depositor and investor funds  assure adequate liquidity  maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest sensitive liabilities and enhance earnings 
interest rate sensitivity management ensures that the company maintains acceptable levels of net interest income throughout a range of interest rate environments 
the company seeks to maintain its interest rate risk within a range that it believes is both manageable and prudent  given its capital and income generating capacity 
liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital that would arise from a bank s inability to meet its obligations when they come due  without incurring unacceptable losses 
liquidity management is a planning process that ensures that the company has ample funds from operations  cash flow from interest  payments and principal repayment of loans and investment securities  proceeds from sales of assets  and cash flow from increases in deposits from customers to satisfy operational needs  potential deposit outflows  repayment of borrowings  loan commitments  and the projected credit needs of its customer base 
in addition  the company has a number of collateralized borrowing facilities with the federal home loan bank and federal reserve  primary broker dealers and other sources that are or can be used as sources of liquidity without having to sell assets to raise cash 
the company has an asset liability management committee  which manages the risks associated with the volatility of interest rates and the resulting impact on net interest income  net income and capital 
the management of interest rate risk at the company is performed by income simulation analysis which analyzes the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income  net income and capital over specific periods of time and captures the dynamic impact of interest rate changes on the company s mix of assets and liabilities 
the asset liability committee of the company believes that financial simulation modeling reasonably estimates the effects and exposure on net interest income to changes in interest rates 
it attempts to measure the degree to which the interest income and interest expense on certain assets and liabilities which are directly linked to market indices  such as fed funds or the prime rate or libor  may change as market interest rates change 
it also attempts to measure the degree to which interest expense on deposits  which are administered by the bank s management but which need to be generally competitive with the deposit rates of other banks  may change as market interest rates change  and the degree to which balances in deposit accounts may change due to changes in administered rates 
it additionally attempts to measure how changes in the composition of the investment portfolio may change the potential interest income and cash flow of the bank  and how hedging instruments such as interest rate derivatives may be used to change the interest sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities 
net interest income simulation is designed to address the likely results to net interest income as a result of interest rate changes and behavioral response of the components of the balance sheet to those changes 
the market value of portfolio equity represents the estimated fair values of the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items 
the estimated fair value of many loans and other assets  and of deposits and other liabilities  may not be based on public market prices if markets do not readily exist for trading and valuing such assets and liabilities 
financial modeling is performed under several scenarios including a regulatory interest rate shock scenario which measures changes in net interest income over the next twelve months and market value of portfolio equity given instantaneous and sustained changes in interest rates 
the company enters into interest rate derivative contracts interest rate swaps  interest rate floors  and interest rate caps from time to time for asset liability management purposes 
the purpose of these contracts is to limit the volatility in the company s net interest income and net interest margin in the event of changes in interest rates  in the context of the management of the company s overall asset liability risk 
management did not enter into these contracts for speculative purposes 
the company s derivative contracts include libor indexed interest rate swaps entered into in connection with certain fixed rate certificates of deposits and with a specified amount of the company s fixed rate borrowings  to effectively convert those fixed rate liabilities into libor indexed liabilities 
the notional amount of the derivative contracts totals million at december  the derivative contracts hedging the fixed rate certificates of deposit and the fixed rate borrowings are accounted for as fair value hedges using the short cut method under sfas no 
under the short cut method  any changes in value of the hedged item is assumed to be exactly as much as the change in the value of the derivative contract 
therefore  in a fair value hedge  the hedged item is adjusted by exactly the same amount as the derivative  with no impact on earnings 
the company s policies for the use of interest rate derivative contracts  its actual use of interest rate derivative contracts  and the effectiveness of the interest rate derivative contracts as hedges are reviewed throughout the year by the company s asset liability committee
