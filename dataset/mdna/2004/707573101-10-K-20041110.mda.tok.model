references to specific years preceded by fiscal eg fiscal refer to the company s fiscal year ended july overview the company has been principally engaged in the purchase  transportation and sale of lpg for distribution into northeast mexico 
in connection with the company s desire to reduce quantities of inventory  the company also sells lpg to us and canadian customers 
during fiscal  the company derived of its revenues from sales of lpg to pmi  its primary customer 
the company provides products and services through a combination of fixed margin and fixed price contracts 
costs included in cost of goods sold  other than the purchase price of lpg  may affect actual profits from sales  including costs relating to transportation  storage  leases and maintenance 
mismatches in volumes of lpg purchased from suppliers and volumes sold to pmi or others could result in gains during periods of rising lpg prices or losses during periods of declining lpg prices as a result of holding inventories or disposing of excess inventories 
during june  the company began the fuel sales business with the ability to access certain pipeline and terminal systems located in california  arizona  nevada and texas 
fuel sales approximated million for the year ended july  which represents approximately of total revenues 
on september   penn octane completed a series of transactions involving i the transfer of substantially all of its owned pipeline and terminal assets in brownsville and matamoros to rvop ii transferred its interest in rvop to rio vista and iii the spin off  resulting in rio vista becoming a separate public company 
the common units represented of rio vista s outstanding units 
the remaining of such units  which is the general partner interest  is owned and controlled by the general partner  and the general partner will be responsible for the management of rio vista 
accordingly the company will have control of rio vista by virtue of its ownership and related voting control of the general partner and rio vista will be consolidated with the company and the interests of the limited partners will be classified as minority interests in the company s consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to the spin off  rio vista will sell lpg directly to pmi and will purchase lpg from penn octane under a long term supply agreement 
the purchase price of the lpg from penn octane will be determined based on the proportionate share of the costs associated with lpg business of penn octane and rio vista 
the transfer of such assets and the distribution of the rio vista common units were conducted in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement  the omnibus agreement  the purchase agreement for lpg  the contribution  conveyance and assumption agreement and the conveyance agreement  copies of which are attached as exhibits to this report 
these agreements are described in penn octane s current report on form k filed by penn octane with the sec on september   and incorporated herein by reference 
penn octane corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries which includes rio vista and its consolidated subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as the company 
penn octane will continue to sell lpg to pmi through its supply contract with rio vista  and it will shift certain costs of operations related to the brownsville and matamoros terminals and pipelines  and certain administrative costs to rio vista 
in addition  it will continue to manage rio vista through the general partner and to explore opportunities to acquire and grow other lines of business such as the fuel sales business described below 
penn octane will benefit from the spin off indirectly based on the success of rio vista through penn octane s ownership of the general partner 
as a limited partnership  rio vista is expected to have the following benefits not available to penn octane 
tax efficiency 
as a limited partnership  rio vista will be able to operate in a more tax efficient manner by eliminating corporate federal income taxes on a portion of future taxable income which would have been fully subject to corporate federal income taxes 
raising capital 
as a limited partnership  rio vista will have an improved ability to raise capital for expansion 
acquisitions 
due to industry preference and familiarity with the limited partnership structure  rio vista will have a competitive advantage over a company taxed as a corporation in making acquisitions of assets that generate qualifying income  as this term is defined in section of the internal revenue code 
recognition 
as a limited partnership  penn octane anticipates that both penn octane and rio vista will receive increased analyst coverage and acceptance in the marketplace 
lpg sales the following table shows the company s volume sold in gallons and average sales price for fiscal years ended july   and volume sold lpg millions of gallons pmi lpg millions of gallons other average sales price lpg per gallon pmi lpg per gallon other recent trends 
since april  pmi has contracted with the company for volumes which are significantly lower than amounts purchased by pmi in similar periods during previous years 
see liquidity and capital resources sales to pmi below 
the company believes that the reduction of volume commitments is based on additional lpg production by pemex being generated from the burgos basin field in reynosa  mexico  an area within the proximity of the company s mexican terminal facilities 
although the company is not aware of the total amount of lpg actually being produced by pemex from the burgos basin  it is aware that pemex has constructed and is operating two new cryogenic facilities at the burgos basin which it believes may have a capacity of producing up to million gallons of lpg per month 
the company also believes that pemex is intending to install two additional cryogenic facilities  with similar capacity  to be operational in early the company is also not aware of the capacity at which the current cryogenic facilities are being operated 
furthermore  the company is not aware of the actual gas reserves of the burgos basin or the gas quality  each of which could significantly impact lpg production amounts 
the company still believes that its lpg supplies are competitive with the necessary us imports of lpg by pemex and that the lpg volumes which are actually produced from the burgos basin would not eliminate the need for us lpg imports by pemex and that lpg volumes produced from the burgos basin would be more economically suited for distribution to points further south in mexico rather than in the company s strategic zone 
during june  valero lp  a lp limited partnership valero began operation of a newly constructed lpg terminal facility in nuevo laredo  mexico and a newly constructed pipeline connecting the terminal facility in nuevo laredo  mexico to existing pipelines in juarez  texas which connect directly to valero energy corporation s corpus christi  texas and three rivers  texas refineries 
valero has contracted with pmi under a five year agreement to deliver approximately million gallons of which million gallons were previously delivered by truck from three rivers  texas of lpg per month 
valero has also indicated that it intends to increase capacity of its nuevo laredo terminal to million gallons per month 
the company believes that if valero intends to maximize capacity of these facilities  then it would be required to obtain additional lpg supplies from major lpg hubs located in corpus christi and mont belvieu  texas 
accordingly  the company believes that any additional supplies over amounts currently available to the mexican market through valero s system could be more expensive than the company s currently available supplies and delivery systems 
during  a pipeline operated by el paso energy between corpus christi  texas and hidalgo county  texas was closed 
historically these facilities had supplied approximately million gallons of lpg per month to the company s strategic zone 
the company is not aware of any future plans for these facilities 
during  pmi constructed and began operations of a refined products cross border pipeline connecting a pipeline running from pemex s cadereyta refinery in monterey  mexico to terminal facilities operated by transmontagne  inc  in brownsville  texas 
transmontagne is a us corporation 
the pipeline crosses the us mexico border near the proximity of the company s pipelines 
in connection with the construction of the pipeline  pmi was required to obtain an easement from the company for an approximate acre portion of the pipeline 
under the terms of the easement  pmi has warranted that it will not transport lpg through october  results of operations year ended july  compared with july  revenues 
revenues for the year ended july   were million compared with million for the year ended july   an increase of million or 
of this increase  million was attributable to increases in average sales prices of lpg sold to pmi during the year ended july   million was attributable to increased average sales prices of lpg sold to customers other than pmi during the year ended july  and million was attributable to new revenues generated for the company s fuel sales business which commenced during the fiscal  partially offset by million attributable to decreased volumes of lpg sold to pmi during the year ended july  and million attributable to decreased volumes of lpg sold to customers other than pmi during the year ended july  cost of goods sold

during fiscal  the company recorded a loss on the sale of cng assets of  and the company recorded an asset impairment charge of  other income expense 
other income expense was million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended july  the decrease in other expense was due primarily to reduced interest costs resulting from reduced debt  decreased amortization of iscounts on outstanding debt incurred  reduction in the settlement of litigation costs and  of other income related to the cancellation of a contract during the year ended july  income tax

the mexican subsidiaries file their income tax returns on a calendar year basis 
the company can receive a credit against any future tax payments due to the extent of any prior alternative minimum taxes paid  at july   
liquidity and capital resources general 
the company has had an accumulated deficit since its inception and has historically had a deficit in working capital 
in addition  substantially all of the company s assets are pledged or committed to be pledged as collateral on existing debt in connection with the restructured notes  the  notes and the rzb credit facility 
the rzb credit facility is an uncommitted facility which is authorized every ninety days and is reviewed annually at march the company may need to increase its credit facility for increases in quantities of lpg and fuel products purchased and or to finance future price increases of lpg and fuel products 
the company depends heavily on sales to one major customer  pmi 
since april  the company has been operating on month to month contracts with pmi see below 
the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been provided by sales of lpg  proceeds from the issuance of short term and long term debt  revolving credit facilities and credit arrangements  sale or issuance of preferred and common stock of the company and proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
penn octane has recently completed the transfer of a major portion of its assets to rio vista and the spin off of rio vista to its stockholders 
as a result of the spin off  the company s stockholders equity has been materially reduced by the amount of the spin off and a portion of penn octane s current cash flow from operations will be shifted to rio vista as of the date of the spin off 
therefore  penn octane s remaining cash flow may not be sufficient to allow penn octane to pay its liabilities and obligations when due 
rio vista will be liable as guarantor on penn octane s collateralized debt discussed in the preceding paragraph and will continue to pledge all of its assets as collateral 
penn octane does not believe that it has a federal income tax in connection with the spin off due to utilization of existing net operating loss carryforwards 
the company estimates alternative minimum tax and state franchise tax of approximately  however  the internal revenue service irs may review penn octane s federal income tax returns and challenge positions that penn octane may take when preparing those income tax returns  including positions that it may take with respect to the spin off 
if the irs challenges any of the company s positions  penn octane will vigorously defend the positions that it takes in preparing its federal income tax  including positions that it may take with respect to the spin off 
in addition  rio vista has agreed to indemnify penn octane for a period of three years from the fiscal year end that includes the date of the spin off for any federal income tax liabilities resulting from the spin off in excess of million see spin off below 
the volume of lpg sold to pmi has been materially reduced over historical levels resulting in a reduction of the company s cash flow see discussion below 
in addition  rio vista intends to make distributions on a quarterly basis to its unitholders beginning in february initially  those distributions are expected to be approximately  per quarter 
also  during the years ended july  and  professional fees and related costs associated with the spin off totaled approximately  and  respectively 
the company expects to eliminate these costs in future periods 
however  as a result of the spin off  the company estimates that consolidated operating expenses will increase by approximately  on an annual basis as a result of additional public company and income tax preparation costs related to rio vista 
as a result of the reduced cash flow and the intention of rio vista to make distributions  there may not be sufficient cash flow to make such distributions and to pay penn octane s obligations when due 
in the event penn octane is unable to pay its liabilities and obligations when due  rio vista s payment obligations may be triggered under its guarantees to penn octane and penn octane s creditors and rio vista may be required to pay such liabilities and obligations of penn octane to avoid foreclosure of its assets by penn octane s creditors 
although rio vista is not required to do so  if penn octane is unable to pay its obligations when they become due  rio vista may lend the necessary funds to penn octane 
conversely  if rio vista does not have the funds necessary to make its distributions  to the extent that penn octane has sufficient cash to do so  it intends to lend such amounts to rio vista 
if rio vista s revenues and other sources of liquidity after its quarterly distributions are not adequate to satisfy such payment obligations of penn octane and or penn octane does not have the necessary cash to loan to rio vista  rio vista may be required to reduce or eliminate the quarterly distributions to unitholders and or penn octane and or rio vista may be required to raise additional funds to avoid foreclosure 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to either penn octane or rio vista or available at all 
in the event penn octane is required to raise additional funds  management does not believe that it would be able to obtain such financing from traditional commercial lenders 
rather  penn octane would likely have to conduct sales of its equity and or debt securities through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
if additional amounts cannot be raised and penn octane is unable to restructure its obligations  material adverse consequences to its business  financial condition  results of operations would likely occur 
further  if penn octane is determined to have a federal income tax liability as a result of the spin off and if penn octane is unable to pay such liabilities  the internal revenue service may assert that the penn octane stockholders who receive common units in the spin off are liable for unpaid federal income taxes of penn octane  including interest and any penalties  up to the value of the rio vista common units received by each stockholder

sales to pmi 
on march   the company s sales agreement with pmi the contract expired 
during the months of april through october  the company and pmi have entered into monthly agreements for the sale of lpg the monthly contracts 
under the terms of the monthly contracts for april  may and june  the minimum amount of lpg to be purchased per month by pmi was million gallons 
under the terms of the monthly contracts for july  august and september  the minimum amount of lpg to be purchased per month by pmi was million gallons 
under the terms of the monthly contracts for october and november  the minimum amount of lpg to be purchased per month by pmi is million gallons 
during the months of april  may  june  july  august  september and october  the actual amount of lpg purchased by pmi was approximately million gallons  million gallons  million gallons  million gallons  million gallons  million gallons and million gallons  respectively 
the expiration of the contract has caused a reduction in the company s gross revenue due to the reduction in lpg volumes sold to pmi from approximately million gallons per month under the contract to approximately million gallons per month under the monthly contracts 
the change in volume from million gallons to an average of approximately million gallons for the months of april through september had the impact of reducing gross profit by approximately  per month on average 
the company was able to offset a portion of the reduction in gross profit by reducing its monthly variable costs by approximately  in addition  the company has also been able to offset further the reduction in gross profit by negotiating more favorable terms under its lpg supply contracts  resulting in savings of approximately  per month and will receive additional savings of approximately  per month beginning in october as a result of the company s cost reduction efforts  the net effect of the reduction in volumes from million gallons per month to million gallons per month is a monthly decrease in gross profit of approximately  to further reduce costs  the company terminated el paso and duke supply agreements totaling approximately million gallons per month  which terminations allowed the company to reduce losses from the disposal of excess inventory 
the company continues to negotiate for the extension and or renewal of the lpg contract with pmi 
there is no assurance that the lpg contract with pmi will be extended and or renewed  and if so  that the terms will be more or less favorable than those of the monthly contracts 
until the terms of a new long term contract are reached  the company expects to enter into additional monthly agreements similar to the monthly contracts 
the company s management believes that pmi s reduction of volume commitments for april through october is based on additional lpg production by pemex being generated from the burgos basin field in reynosa  mexico  an area within the proximity of the company s mexican terminal facilities 
in the event the volume of lpg purchased by pmi under the month to month agreements declines below the current level of approximately million gallons  assuming margins remain unchanged  the company would suffer material adverse consequences to its business  financial condition and results of operations to the extent that the company is unable to obtain additional favorable price and or volume concessions from lpg suppliers 
the company is attempting to obtain additional price and or volume concessions from its lpg suppliers to lower costs 
if the company is unsuccessful in lowering its costs to offset a decline in volumes below million gallons per month and or the company is forced to accept similar or lower prices for sales to pmi  the results of operations of the company may be adversely affected 
the company may not have sufficient cash flow or available credit to absorb such reductions in gross profit 
pmi has primarily used the matamoros terminal facility to load lpg purchased from the company for distribution by truck in mexico 
the company continues to use the brownsville terminal facility in connection with lpg delivered by railcar to other customers  storage and as an alternative terminal in the event the matamoros terminal facility cannot be used 
revenues from pmi totaled approximately million for the year ended july   representing approximately of total revenue for the period 
lpg supply agreements

the duke supply contract  which expired in march was not renewed 
the purchase price was indexed to variable posted prices 
the company is currently purchasing lpg from the above mentioned suppliers the suppliers 
the company s aggregate costs per gallon to purchase lpg less any applicable adjustments are below the aggregate sales prices per gallon of lpg sold to its customers 
the company s current long term supply agreements in effect as of july  supply contracts require the company to purchase minimum quantities of lpg totaling up to approximately million gallons per month although the monthly contracts require pmi to purchase lesser quantities 
the actual amounts supplied under supply contracts averaged approximately million gallons per month for the year ended july  in addition to the lpg costs charged by the suppliers  the company also incurs additional costs to deliver the lpg to the company s facilities 
furthermore  the company may incur significant additional costs associated with the storage  disposal and or changes in lpg prices resulting from the excess of the plant commitment or koch supply over actual sales volumes to pmi 
under the terms of the supply contracts  the company must provide letters of credit in amounts equal to the cost of the product to be purchased 
in addition  the cost of the product purchased is tied directly to overall market conditions 
as a result  the company s existing letter of credit facility may not be adequate to meet the letter of credit requirements under the agreements with the suppliers or other suppliers due to increases in quantities of lpg purchased and or to finance future price increases of lpg 
credit arrangements 
pursuant to an amendment see below  as of july  the company had a million credit facility with rzb finance llc rzb for demand loans and standby letters of credit the rzb credit facility to finance the company s purchases of lpg and fuel products in connection with the fuel sales business 
the rzb credit facility is an uncommitted facility under which the letters of credit have an expiration date of no more than days and the facility reviewed annually at march under the rzb credit facility  the company pays a fee with respect to each letter of credit thereunder in an amount equal to the greater of i  ii of the maximum face amount of such letter of credit  or iii such higher amount as may be agreed to between the company and rzb

effective april   the rzb credit facility was informally amended to provide for a credit limit of million through march   although the facility may be terminated any time 
in addition  rzb also approved the company s use of the rzb credit facility to purchase fuel products in addition to lpg  including a million limit for purchase of fuel products inventory for a maximum of days 
based on current minimum purchase commitments under the company s lpg supply agreements and current lpg prices  the amount available to finance fuel products and lpg purchases in excess of current minimum purchase commitments is limited to current volumes and therefore the ability of the company to grow the fuel sales business is dependent on future increases in its rzb credit facility or other sources of financing  the reduction of lpg supply commitments and or the reduction in lpg or fuel products prices 
in connection with the amendment  the company is required to pay rzb annual fees of  in addition to the fees described above

the company intends to upgrade its computer and information systems at a total estimated cost of approximately  acquisition of mexican subsidiaries 
effective april   the company completed the purchase of of the outstanding common stock of both termatsal and pennmex the mexican subsidiaries  previous affiliates of the company which were principally owned by a former officer and director see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
the company paid a nominal purchase price of approximately  for each mexican subsidiary 
as a result of the acquisition  the company has included the results of the mexican subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements at july   and since inception through the acquisition date  the operations of the mexican subsidiaries had been funded by the company and such amounts funded were included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
therefore there are no material differences between the amounts previously reported by the company and the amounts that would have been reported by the company had the mexican subsidiaries been consolidated since inception 
during july  the company acquired an option to purchase tergas  an affiliate owned by mr 
soriano and the remaining balance owned by mr 
abelardo mier  a consultant of the company  for a nominal price of approximately  since inception the operations of tergas have been funded by the company and the assets  liabilities and results of operations of tergas are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
mexican operations 
under current mexican law  foreign ownership of mexican entities involved in the distribution of lpg or the operation of lpg terminal facilities is prohibited 
foreign ownership is permitted in the transportation and storage of lpg 
mexican law also provides that a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage or distribution 
pennmex has a transportation permit and termatsal owns  leases  or is in the process of obtaining the land or rights of way used in the construction of the mexican portion of the us mexico pipelines  and owns the mexican portion of the assets comprising the us mexico pipelines and the matamoros terminal facility 
the company s consolidated mexican affiliate  tergas  sa de sa tergas  has been granted the permit to operate the matamoros terminal facility and the company relies on tergas permit to continue its delivery of lpg at the matamoros terminal facility 
the company pays tergas its actual cost for distribution services at the matamoros terminal facility plus a small profit 
the company had previously completed construction of an additional lpg terminal facility in saltillo  mexico the saltillo terminal 
the company was unable to receive all the necessary approvals to operate the facility at that location 
the terminal was subsequently dismantled 
the company has accounted for the saltillo terminal at cost 
the cost included in the balance sheet is comprised primarily of dismantled pipe  dismantled steel structures  steel storage tanks  pumps and compressors and capitalized engineering costs related to the design of the terminal 
the cost of dismantling the terminal at the saltillo location was expensed and on going storage fees have also been expensed 
as a result of the reduced volumes of lpg being sold to pmi and the short term nature of the agreements see sales to pmi above  the company has determined that construction of a new saltillo terminal is currently not feasible

deregulation of the lpg industry in mexico 
the mexican petroleum industry is governed by the ley reglarmentaria del art culo constitutional en el ramo del petr leo the regulatory law to article of the constitution of mexico concerning petroleum affairs the regulatory law  and ley org nica del petr leos mexicanos y organismos subsidiarios the organic law of petr leos mexicanos and subsidiary entities the organic law 
under mexican law and related regulations  pemex is entrusted with the central planning and the strategic management of mexico s petroleum industry  including importation  sales and transportation of lpg 
in carrying out this role  pemex controls pricing and distribution of various petrochemical products  including lpg 
beginning in  as part of a national privatization program  the regulatory law was amended to permit private entities to transport  store and distribute natural gas with the approval of the ministry of energy 
as part of this national privatization program  the mexican government is expected to deregulate the lpg market deregulation 
in june  the regulatory law for lpg was changed to permit foreign entities to participate without limitation in the defined lpg activities related to transportation and storage 
however  foreign entities are prohibited from participating in the distribution of lpg in mexico 
upon deregulation  mexican entities will be able to import lpg into mexico 
under mexican law  a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage and distribution 
the company or its consolidated affiliate expect to sell lpg directly to independent mexican distributors as well as pmi upon deregulation 
the company anticipates that the independent mexican distributors will be required to obtain authorization from the mexican government for the importation of lpg upon deregulation prior to entering into contracts with the company 
during july  the mexican government announced that it would begin to accept applications from mexican companies for permits to allow for the importation of lpg pursuant to provisions already provided for under existing mexican law 
in connection with the above  in august  tergas received a one year permit from the mexican government to import lpg 
during september  the mexican government decided to delay the implementation of deregulation and asked tergas to defer use of the permit and as a result  the company did not sell lpg to distributors other than pmi 
in march  the mexican government again announced its intention to issue permits for free importation of lpg into mexico by distributors and others beginning august  which was again delayed 
to date the mexican government has continued to delay implementation of deregulation 
tergas permit to import lpg expired during august tergas intends to obtain a new permit when the mexican government again begins to accept applications 
as a result of the foregoing  it is uncertain as to when  if ever  deregulation will actually occur and the effect  if any  it will have on the company 
however  should deregulation occur  it is the company s intention to sell lpg directly to distributors in mexico as well as to pmi 
the point of sale for lpg which flows through the us mexico pipelines for delivery to the matamoros terminal facility is the united states mexico border 
for lpg delivered into mexico  pmi is the importer of record

fuel sales business 
during june  the company began the fuel sales business 
the company sells fuel products through transactional  bulk and or rack transactions 
typical transactional and bulk sales are made based on a predetermined net spread between the purchase and sales price over posted monthly variable prices and or daily spot prices 
rack sales transactions are based on variable sale prices charged by the company which are tied to posted daily spot prices and purchase costs which are based on a monthly average or day average based on posted prices 
the company pays pipeline and terminal fees based on regulated rates 
the fuel sales business on the west coast of the united states is characterized by limited pipeline and terminal space to move sufficient fuel products to locations where demand for fuel products exists 
the company has the ability to access to certain pipeline and terminal systems located in california  arizona  nevada and texas  where it is able to deliver its fuel products 
the markets where the company has targeted its products are generally in areas where the fuel products are difficult to deliver due to the infrastructure limitations and accordingly  the company s access provides an advantage over other potential competitors who may not have access to these pipelines or terminals 
in addition  the company s supply contracts provide it with greater flexibility to manage changes in the prices of the fuel products 
the company believes it has an advantage over other competitors based on its favorable supply contracts and existing access to certain pipelines and terminals 
for bulk and transactional sales  the company enters into individual sales contracts for each sale 
rack sales are subject to credit limitations imposed on each individual buyer by the company 
the company has several supply contracts for each of the fuel products it sells 
the supply contracts are for annual periods with flexible volumes but they may be terminated sooner by the supplier if the company consistently fails to purchase minimum volumes of fuel products 
the ability of the company to participate in the fuel sales business is largely dependent on the company s ability to finance its supplies 
currently  the company utilizes the rzb credit facility to finance the purchases of fuel products 
based on the company s lpg purchase commitments  increases in the costs of lpg and or the increases in the costs of fuel products  the amount of financing available for the fuel sales business may be reduced 
federal and state agencies require the company to obtain the necessary regulatory and other approvals for its fuel sales business

holders of unexercised warrants of penn octane as of the date of the spin off received an adjustment to reduce the exercise price of their existing penn octane warrant and new warrants to purchase common units of rio vista to reflect the transfer of assets from penn octane into rio vista 
as of the date of the spin off  penn octane had  warrants to purchase common stock outstanding 
the adjustment to the exercise price of penn octane warrants was determined by multiplying the original exercise price of penn octane warrants by 
the number of rio vista warrants given to the holder of penn octane warrants as of the date of the spin off was determined by dividing the existing number of warrants of penn octane by eight 
the exercise price of the rio vista warrants was determined by multiplying the original exercise price of the existing penn octane warrants by 
the expiration date of the rio vista warrants is the same as the existing penn octane warrants 
under the terms of rio vista s partnership  the general partner is entitled to receive cash distributions from rio vista in accordance with a formula whereby the general partner will receive disproportionately more distributions per unit than the holders of the common units as annual cash distributions exceed certain milestones 
it is anticipated that mr 
richter and shore capital will exercise their general partner options in the near future 
the exercise price for each option will be the pro rata share 
of rio vista s tax basis capital immediately after the spin off 
penn octane will retain voting control of rio vista pursuant to a voting agreement 
in addition  shore capital received warrants to acquire  shares of the common stock of penn octane at per common share and  common units of rio vista at per common unit 
the warrants are exercisable beginning on october  and expire on july  rio vista is liable as guarantor for penn octane s collateralized debt and will continue to pledge all of its assets as collateral 
rio vista may also be prohibited from making any distributions to unit holders if it would cause an event of default  or if an event of default is existing  under penn octane s revolving credit facilities  or any other covenant which may exist under any other credit arrangement or other regulatory requirement at the time 
the spin off is a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under applicable state  local and foreign tax laws to both the company and its stockholders 
penn octane intends to treat the spin off as a partial liquidation for federal income tax purposes 
a partial liquidation is defined under section e of the internal revenue code as a distribution that i is not essentially equivalent to a dividend  as determined at the corporate level  which generally requires a genuine contraction of the business of the corporation  ii constitutes a redemption of stock and iii is made pursuant to a plan of partial liquidation and within the taxable year in which the plan is adopted or within the succeeding taxable year 
penn octane does not believe that it has a federal income tax in connection with the spin off due to utilization of existing net operating loss carryforwards 
the company estimates alternative minimum taxes and state franchise tax of approximately  however  the internal revenue service the irs may review penn octane s federal income tax returns and challenge positions that penn octane may take when preparing those income tax returns  including positions that it may take with respect to the spin off 
if the irs challenges any of the company s positions  penn octane will vigorously defend the positions that it takes in preparing its federal income tax  including positions that it may take with respect to the spin off 
if there is determined to be an income tax liability resulting from the spin off  to the extent such liability is greater than million  rio vista has agreed to indemnify penn octane for any tax liability resulting from the transaction which is in excess of that amount 
realization of assets 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern 
the company has had an accumulated deficit since inception and has historically had a deficit in working capital 
in addition  substantially all of the company s assets are pledged or committed to be pledged as collateral on existing debt in connection with the restructured notes  the  notes and the rzb credit facility and therefore  the company maybe unable to obtain additional financing collateralized by those assets 
the rzb credit facility may be insufficient to finance the company s lpg sales and or fuel products sales  assuming increases in product costs per gallon  or volumetric growth in product sales  and maybe terminated by rzb with days notice 
since april   the company has been operating under the monthly contracts with pmi see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
the monthly volumes of lpg sold to pmi since april  have been materially less than historical levels 
as discussed in note p to the consolidated financial statements  the company has lpg supply contracts which require it to purchase volumes of lpg materially in excess of monthly volumes under the monthly contracts the mismatched lpg 
the volume of the mismatched lpg was materially lower prior to april  than subsequent to april   and the company was able to dispose of the mismatched lpg prior to april  at acceptable margins 
the company may incur additional reductions of gross profits on sales of lpg in disposing of the mismatched lpg if i the volume of lpg sold under the monthly contracts declines below the current levels of approximately million gallons per month and or the margins are materially reduced and or ii the company cannot successfully reduce the minimum volumes and or purchase costs required under the lpg supply agreements 
the company may not have sufficient cash flow or available credit to absorb such reductions in gross profit 
the company s cash flow has been reduced as a result of lower volumes of sales to pmi 
additionally  the company will also incur the additional public company and income tax preparation costs for rio vista 
as a result  the company may not have sufficient cash flow to make distributions to rio vista s unitholders and to pay penn octane s obligations when due 
in the event penn octane does not pay its obligations when due  rio vista s guarantees to penn octane and penn octane s creditors may be triggered 
accordingly  rio vista may be required to pay such obligations of penn octane to avoid foreclosure of its assets by penn octane s creditors 
if the company s revenues and other sources of liquidity are not adequate to pay penn octane s obligations  rio vista may be required to reduce or eliminate the quarterly distributions to unitholders and or penn octane and or rio vista may be required to raise additional funds to avoid foreclosure 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to either penn octane or rio vista or available at all 
in view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs  recoverability of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon the ability of the company to generate sufficient cash flow through operations or additional debt or equity financing to pay its liabilities and obligations when due 
the ability for the company to generate sufficient cash flows is significantly dependent on the continued sale of lpg to pmi at acceptable monthly sales volumes and margins  the success of the fuel sales business and the adequacy of the rzb credit facility to finance such sales 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue in existence 
to provide the company with the ability it believes necessary to continue in existence  management is negotiating with pmi to increase lpg sales at acceptable monthly volumes and margins 
in addition  management is taking steps to i expand its fuel sales business  ii further diversify its operations to reduce dependency on sales of lpg  iii increase the amount of financing for its products and operations  and iv raise additional debt and or equity capital 
at july   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
if the net operating loss carryforwards are utilized in the future  the company will begin to pay federal income tax at the corporate income tax rate 
recently issued financial accounting standards during  the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable entities fin  which was amended by fin r 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires the beneficiary of a vie to consolidate in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie 
tergas  an affiliate of the company  is a vie and therefore  its assets  liabilities and results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
see note b to those consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
the company believes that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that affect the financial position and results of operations 
revenues recognition the company expects in the future to enter into sales agreements to sell lpg and fuel products for future delivery 
the company will not record sales until the lpg and fuel products are delivered to the customer 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to assets in future periods 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment loss recognized will be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value is less than the carrying value 
assessments of impairment are subject to management s judgments and based on estimates that management is required to make 
depreciation and amortization expenses property  plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization rates are based on management s estimate of the future utilization and useful lives of the assets 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation using the provisions of abp intrinsic value method  which is permitted by sfas the difference in net income  if any  between the intrinsic value method and the method provided for by sfas fair value method is required to be disclosed in the financial statements on an annual and interim basis as a result of the issuance of sfas allowance for doubtful accounts the carrying value of trade accounts receivable is based on estimated fair value 
the determination of fair value is subject to management s judgments and is based on estimates that management is required to make 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to the extent that the company maintains quantities of lpg inventory in excess of commitments for quantities of undelivered lpg and or has commitments for undelivered lpg in excess of inventory balances  the company is exposed to market risk related to the volatility of lpg prices 
in the event that inventory balances exceed commitments for undelivered lpg  during periods of falling lpg prices  the company may sell excess inventory to customers to reduce the risk of these price fluctuations 
in the event that commitments for undelivered lpg exceed inventory balances  the company may purchase contracts which protect the company against future price increases of lpg 
the company does not maintain quantities of lpg inventory in excess of quantities actually ordered by pmi 
therefore  the company has not currently entered into and does not currently expect to enter into any arrangements in the future to mitigate the impact of commodity price risk 
to the extent the company maintains quantities of fuel products inventory in excess of commitments for quantities of undelivered fuel products  the company is exposed to market risk related to the volatility of fuel product prices 
in the event that inventory balances exceed commitments for undelivered fuel products  during periods of falling fuel products prices  the company may sell excess inventory to customers to reduce the risk of these price fluctuations 
the company has historically borrowed only at fixed interest rates 
all current interest bearing debt is at a fixed rate 
trade accounts receivable from the company s limited number of customers and the company s trade and other accounts payable do not bear interest 
the company s credit facility with rzb does not bear interest since generally no cash advances are made to the company by rzb 
fees paid to rzb for letters of credit are based on a fixed schedule as provided in the company s agreement with rzb 
therefore  the company currently has limited  if any  interest rate risk 
the company routinely converts us dollars into mexican pesos to pay terminal operating costs and income taxes 
such costs have historically been less than million per year and the company expects such costs will remain at less than million in any year 
the company does not maintain mexican peso bank accounts with other than nominal balances 
therefore  the company has limited  if any  risk related to foreign currency exchange rates
