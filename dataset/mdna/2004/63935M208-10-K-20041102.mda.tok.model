all statements other than statements of historical information provided herein are forward looking statements and may contain information about financial results  economic conditions  trends and known uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  which include those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this report under the heading certain risk factors that may affect future results and the risks discussed in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis  judgment  belief or expectation only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
overview we provide our services to customers typically pursuant to agreements with a term of one to three years and monthly payment installments 
as a result  these agreements provide us with a base of recurring revenue 
our revenue increases by adding new customers or additional services to existing customers 
our overall base of recurring revenue is affected by new customers  renewals or terminations of agreements with existing customers 
a large portion of the costs to operate our data centers  such as rent  product development and general and administrative expenses  does not depend strictly on the number of customers or the amount of services we provide 
as we add new customers or new services to existing customers  we generally incur limited additional expenses relating to telecommunications  utilities  hardware and software costs  and payroll expenses 
we have substantial capacity to add customers to our data centers 
our relatively fixed cost base  sufficient capacity for expansion and limited incremental variable costs provide us with the opportunity to grow profitably 
however  these same fixed costs present us with the risk that we may incur losses if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue 
in recent years  we have grown through acquisitions of new businesses and have restructured our historical operations 
specifically  in december  we acquired clearblue technologies management  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of our majority stockholder at the time of the acquisition and therefore was accounted for as a common control merger  adding application management and development capabilities to our managed application services  in february  we acquired avasta  adding capabilities to our managed application services  in april  we acquired conxion  providing key services to our managed application services and managed infrastructure services  in may  we acquired assets of interliant  forming the core of our managed messaging services  and in august and april  we acquired assets of cbt which was our majority stockholder at that time and therefore was accounted for as a common control merger related to colocation  bandwidth  security and disaster recovery services  enhancing our managed infrastructure services 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of surebridge adding significant capabilities to our managed application and professional services 
prior to september  substantially all of our services were managed application services  and we have added managed infrastructure and managed messaging services and increased managed applications and professional services since that time 
this transformation in our business will result in our recent results being more relevant to an understanding of our business than our historical results 
we also expect to make additional acquisitions to take advantage of our available capacity  which will have significant effects on our financial results in the future 
our acquisitions of cbtm and assets of cbt were accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interest due to common control ownership 
the assets and the liabilities of cbt  cbtm and navisite were combined at their historical amounts beginning on september   the date on which cbt obtained a majority ownership of navisite 
our acquisitions of avasta and conxion and selected assets of interliant were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and as such  the results of operations and cash flows relating to these acquisitions were included in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated 
table of contents statement of cash flows from their respective dates of acquisition of february   april  and may  our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of surebridge was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations and cash flows relating to this acquisition have been included in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows from its acquisition date of june  the audit report on our fiscal year consolidated financial statements from kpmg llp  our independent auditors  contains kpmg s opinion that our recurring losses from operations since inception and accumulated deficit  as well as other factors  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
while we cannot assure you that we will continue as a going concern  we believe that we have developed and are implementing an operational plan that aligns our cost structure with our projected revenue growth 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended july  revenue revenue  related parties total revenue cost of revenue impairment  restructuring and other total cost of revenue gross profit loss operating expenses product development selling and marketing general and administrative impairment  restructuring and other total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense  net loss before income tax expense income tax expense net loss comparison of the years  and revenue we derive our revenue from outsourced managed hosting  colocation and application services comprised of a variety of service offerings  including providing related professional and consulting services  to mid sized enterprises  divisions of large multi national companies and government agencies 
total revenue for fiscal year increased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal year the overall growth in revenue was mainly due to the full year impact of the revenue resulting from our fiscal year acquisitions and revenue resulting from our fiscal year acquisitions which combined contributed approximately million in revenue during the year ended july  the increased revenue during fiscal year was partially offset by net lost customer revenue of approximately million 
revenue from related parties decreased during the year ended july  to approximately  from approximately million during the year ended july  total revenue for fiscal year increased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal year the overall growth in revenue was mainly due to revenue resulting from an increased number of customers gained pursuant to our acquisitions  which contributed approximately million in revenue during fiscal year  offset by net lost customer revenue of approximately million 
revenue from non related parties increased by to approximately million in fiscal year 
table of contents from approximately million in fiscal year but was offset by a decline in revenue from related parties 
revenue from related parties decreased by to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in revenue from related parties principally consisted of sales of services to cmgi and its affiliates until september when cmgi sold its equity and debt interests in us to cbt  and then this related party revenue was recorded as revenue 
the decrease in related party revenue for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to cmgi s affiliates terminating their relationships with us upon the completion of their contracts 
included in fiscal year revenue is approximately million in non recurring revenue from early contract termination settlements  primarily from related parties  including million from the termination of a web hosting agreement with engage  inc in fiscal year  one unrelated customer accounted for of our revenue 
in fiscal year  one unrelated customer accounted for of our revenue and in fiscal year one cmgi affiliate accounted for approximately of our revenue 
gross profit loss cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits for operations personnel  bandwidth fees and related internet connectivity charges  equipment costs and related depreciation and costs to run our data centers  such as rent and utilities 
gross profit of million for the year ended july  increased approximately million  or  from a gross profit of approximately million for the year ended july  gross profit for fiscal year represented of total revenue  as compared to of total revenue for fiscal year total cost of revenue decreased approximately to million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year the decrease in cost of revenue of million resulted primarily from cost reductions relating to the integration of our acquisitions  the scaling of our fixed infrastructure costs over a larger revenue customer base  and the reduction of depreciation expense due to lower levels of capital equipment purchases  partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to our fiscal and acquisitions 
included in total cost of revenue for fiscal year are impairment and restructuring charges totaling  gross profit of million for the year ended july  increased approximately million  from a gross loss of million for the year ended july  total cost of revenue decreased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year an impairment charge of million is included in total cost of revenue for fiscal year the increase in cost of revenue  net of the impairment charge  of million resulted primarily from the addition of approximately million in cost of revenue from the acquisitions of subsidiaries of cbt netted with a million reduction in our cost of revenue 
the million reduction in our cost of revenue consisted primarily of reductions in depreciation of million  equipment lease and related costs of million due to restructuring that took place in fiscal year partially offset by increases in labor costs of million  bandwidth costs of million and software licenses of million related to acquisitions made in fiscal year cost of revenue impairment  restructuring and other costs associated with impairment  restructuring and other were million in fiscal year  and relate to the abandonment of data center space at our vienna  virginia facility 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million impairment charge related to leased and owned equipment and long lived assets 
the components of this charge are as follows as a result of a physical inventory of our customer dedicated equipment  we recorded an impairment charge of million for obsolete equipment and for equipment no longer on hand and identified certain excess assets not in use 

table of contents we modified the payment amounts and terms of operating leases with three equipment vendors such that the modified leases qualify as capital leases 
one of the resulting capital leases is payable in equal monthly payments of  starting in december the second capital lease has total payments of million  of which million was paid in the second quarter of fiscal year and million was paid in fiscal year the third capital lease is payable in monthly payments of  for the first four months and  for the remaining months  starting in april the equipment under all resulting capital leases was capitalized at the fair market value of the equipment at the time of the modification  determined to be million  which was lower than the present value of the future minimum lease payments based on our estimated incremental borrowing rate of 
because the fair market value of the equipment was less than the consideration given  based on a third party appraisal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million 
in addition  we returned some equipment held under operating leases with one of the above lessors and incurred and paid a breakage fee of  we recorded a net million charge representing the future estimated remaining minimum lease payments related to certain idle equipment held under various operating leases 
the equipment had previously been rented to former customers under operating leases  and upon the loss of the customer  the equipment became idle 
based on our then forecasts  the equipment would not be utilized before the related operating leases expired and or the equipment became obsolete 
we evaluated the current and forecasted utilization of our purchased software licenses 
as a result of this evaluation  during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a  impairment for software licenses that would not be utilized before the licenses expired and or became obsolete 
we finalized agreements with various equipment lessors whereby we purchased equipment previously held under operating leases for approximately million 
the fair market value of the equipment at the time of purchase  based on third party appraisal  was approximately million 
as the aggregate fair market value of the equipment  based on third party appraisal  was less than the aggregate consideration given  we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million  as a separate component of cost of revenue  in fiscal year a number of factors occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal year impacted our long lived assets including both our expected future cash flow generation and our expected utilization of the assets within revised operating plans 
these factors included the further deterioration of market conditions within our industry  excess capacity in the industry and in our two data centers  our anticipated data center utilization and our revised business model 
based on these factors and their impact on current and future projected cash flows  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the conclusion of this assessment was that the decline in market conditions within our industry was significant and other than temporary 
in this assessment  we reviewed our long lived assets  which included property  equipment and goodwill 
the carrying amount of goodwill  which totaled  was considered unrecoverable and was written off as of july  and was included as a component of general and administrative expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the measurement of the impairment loss of property and equipment was based on the fair value of the asset  as determined by third party appraisal 
management determined that the best measure of fair value for the property and equipment was a combination of the market and cost approaches 
the cost approach was utilized to determine the fair value of certain computer hardware  leasehold improvements  office furniture and equipment and construction in progress 
the cost approach utilizes estimated replacement reproduction cost  with allowances for physical depreciation and functional obsolescence ie asset utilization 
for certain equipment and leasehold improvements  the market approach was used 
the market approach typically includes comparing recent sales of similar assets and adjusting these comparable transactions based on factors such as age  condition  and type of sale to determine fair value 

table of contents based on the appraised fair value of the property and equipment  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year operating expenses product development 
product development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs 
product development expense increased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately  in fiscal year and represented approximately of total revenue in both fiscal years 
the increase in product development expense of approximately  is primarily related to increased salary expense resulting from an increased headcount 
product development expense decreased to approximately  or of total revenue  in fiscal year from approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year the decrease in product development expenses is primarily related to reduced headcount and related costs resulting from the decrease in product development personnel in fiscal year from fiscal year  combined with a reduction in allocated depreciation and equipment rental expense 
selling and marketing

general and administrative expense increased to approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year from approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year the increase of approximately million was primarily the result of increased salary expense resulting from an increased headcount  as well as increases in legal expenses and bad debt expense partially offset by decreases in severance  consulting  insurance and accounting fees 
general and administrative expense increased to approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year from approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year the increase of approximately  was mainly the result of the addition of approximately million in cbt general and administrative expense  offset by a net decrease in expenses of approximately  the  is primarily comprised of a reduction in bad debt expense of million  partially offset by increases in headcount related expenses of million  increased accounting and legal fees of  and increased expense for amortization of intangibles related to the cbtm acquisition during the fiscal year 
operating expenses impairment  restructuring and other costs associated with impairment  restructuring and abandonment of leased facilities included in operating expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  as compared to costs associated with impairment  restructuring and abandonment of lease facilities of approximately million in fiscal year the costs incurred during fiscal year relate primarily to the abandonment of administrative space at our san jose  california  houston  texas  and syracuse  new york facilities 

table of contents costs associated with impairment  restructuring and other increased to approximately million in fiscal year compared to a reversal of a portion of a previous impairment and restructuring charge of approximately million in fiscal year the increase is due primarily to abandonment of administrative space at our minuteman road  andover  massachusetts facility and the abandonment of administrative space at our la jolla  california office and approximately million impairment of intangible assets by cbt 
we recorded a charge equal to the amount of rent and other direct costs for the period the space is expected to remain unoccupied plus the present value of the amount by which the rent paid by us to the landlord exceeds any rent paid to us by a subtenant under a sublease over the remainder of the lease term 
interest income interest income decreased to approximately  or of total revenue  in fiscal year from approximately  or of total revenue  in fiscal year the decrease is due primarily to the reduced levels of average cash on hand 
interest income decreased to approximately  or of total revenue  in fiscal year from approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year the decrease is due primarily to the reduced levels of average cash on hand 
interest expense interest expense decreased to approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year from approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year the decrease of million is due mainly to the non cash write off of the unamortized beneficial conversion feature related to the conversion of the million of convertible notes during fiscal year interest expense increased to approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year from approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year the increase of million is due mainly to the non cash write off of the unamortized beneficial conversion feature related to the conversion of the million of convertible notes during fiscal year other income expense  net other income was approximately  in fiscal year  as compared to other expense of approximately  in fiscal year the other income recorded during fiscal year includes a  settlement related to a sublease agreement 
other expense increased to an expense of approximately  in fiscal year from an expense of  in fiscal year this increase is mainly due to increased fees related to the accounts receivable financing agreement with silicon valley bank 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and our financing agreement with silicon valley bank 
we had a working capital deficit of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million at july   as compared to a working capital deficit of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  at july  the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended july  was a decrease of million 
the primary uses of cash during fiscal year included million of cash used for operating activities  million for purchases of property and equipment  and million in repayments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
our primary sources of cash during fiscal year were a million decrease in restricted cash  million in proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options under the employee stock option plans  million in net proceeds from our financing agreements and million in proceeds from sale leaseback and note payable transactions 
net cash used for operating activities of million during the fiscal year ended july   resulted primarily from our million net loss  partially offset by million in non cash charges  and million used by net changes in operating assets 
table of contents and liabilities 
at july   we had an accumulated deficit of million  and have reported losses from operations since incorporation 
at july   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
prior to may  our primary sources of cash to fund our operations were sales of equity and convertible debt securities 
since may  our primary source of cash to fund our operations and meet our contacted obligations and commitments has been our accounts receivable financing agreement with silicon valley bank 
on january   we amended this agreement to  among other things  allow for future borrowing to be based on monthly recurring revenue  increase the maximum borrowings level from million to million  and extend the term until january  on april   we amended this agreement  among other things  to increase the maximum borrowing level from million to million  and extend the term until april  under the amended agreement  borrowings are based on monthly recurring revenue 
we are required to prepare and deliver a written request for an advance of up to three times the value of total monthly recurring revenue  calculated to be monthly revenue including revenue from new york state department of labor less professional services revenue 
the bank may then provide an advance of of such value or such other percentage as the bank may determine 
the interest rate under the agreement is variable and is currently calculated at the bank s published prime rate plus four percent 
following completion of certain equity or debt financings  and provided we continue to meet certain ratios under the amended agreement  the interest rate shall be reduced to the bank s prime rate plus one percent 
in no event  however  will the prime rate be less than 
further  the amended agreement requires that we achieve ebitda of at least on a quarterly basis 
the agreement defines ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and excluding acquisition related costs and one time extraordinary charges 
a default under the agreement could result in  among other things  us not being able to borrow additional amounts from silicon valley bank and all or a portion of our outstanding amounts may become due and payable on an accelerated basis  which would adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to manage our business 
on july   we had an outstanding balance under the amended agreement of million 
at july   the company had million in outstanding standby letters of credit  issued in connection with facility and equipment lease agreements  which are cash collateralized 
cash subject to collateral requirements has been recorded as restricted cash and is classified as non current on our balance sheet at july  on june   in connection with our acquisition of the surebridge business  we issued two convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance of the notes at the annual rate of  provided that if an event of default shall occur and be continuing  the interest rate shall be 
notwithstanding the foregoing  no interest shall accrue or be payable on any principal amounts repaid on or prior to the nine month anniversary of the issuance date of the notes 
we must repay the outstanding principal of the notes with all interest accrued thereon  no later than june  in addition  if at any time during the first six months after the date of issuance of the notes we complete certain equity or debt financings  including our proposed public offering  we are obligated to use a significant portion of the proceeds to make payments on the notes  depending on the total net proceeds received by us in the financing 
if we receive net proceeds of less than million in a debt or equity financing  then we would be obligated to make a payment on the notes equal to of the net proceeds 
if we receive net proceeds of between million and million  then we would be obligated to make a payment on the notes equal to million 
if we receive net proceeds in excess of million  then we would be obligated to make a payment on the notes equal to of the net proceeds 
pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement  million of the primary note is callable at any time for a period of one year from june   the date of the surebridge acquisition closing 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the noteholder requested payment of million and the company expects to pay this amount during the second quarter of fiscal year in addition  if we realize net proceeds in excess of million from certain equity or debt financings or sales of assets at any time after six months from the date the notes were issued  we are obligated to use a significant portion of the proceeds to make payments on the notes  depending on the total payments  if any  made on the notes during the first six months after the notes were issued 
if the amount we paid on the notes 
table of contents during the first six months the notes were outstanding is less than million  we would be obligated to make a payment on the notes equal to of the net proceeds 
if the amount we paid on the notes during the first six months the notes were outstanding was greater than million  we would be obligated to make a payment on the notes equal to of the net proceeds 
if the amount we paid on the notes during the first six months the notes were outstanding is between million and million  we would be obligated to make a payment on the notes equal to a percentage between and of the net proceeds received in the financing calculated in accordance with a formula set forth in the notes 
it shall be deemed an event of default under the notes if  among other things  we fail to pay when due any amounts under the notes  if we fail to pay when due or experience an event of default with respect to any debts having an outstanding principal amount of  or more  if we are delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  or if we are acquired and the acquiring party does not expressly agree to assume the notes 
in addition  certain bankruptcy  reorganization  insolvency  dissolution and receivership actions would be deemed an event of default under the notes 
if an event of default under the notes occurs  the holder shall be entitled to declare the notes immediately due and payable in full 
the notes provide that we shall not incur any indebtedness in excess of million in the aggregate  unless such indebtedness is unsecured and expressly subordinated to the notes  is otherwise permitted under the notes  or the proceeds are used to make payments on the notes 
finally  the outstanding principal of and accrued interest on the notes are convertible into shares of navisite common stock at a conversion price of at the election of the holder at any time following the first anniversary of the closing if the aggregate principal outstanding under the notes at such time is greater than or equal to million  at any time following the month anniversary of the closing if the aggregate principal outstanding under the notes at such time is greater than or equal to million  at any time following the second anniversary of the closing  and at any time following an event of default thereunder 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in the future 
we have taken several actions we believe will allow us to continue as a going concern through july   including the closing and integration of strategic acquisitions  the changes to our senior management and bringing costs more in line with projected revenue 
we will need to find sources of financing in order to remain a going concern 
potential sources include our financing agreement with silicon valley bank and public or private sales of equity or debt securities 
we may also consider sales of assets to raise additional cash 
if we use a significant portion of the net proceeds from an offering to acquire a company  technology or product  we will need to raise additional debt or equity capital 
our operating forecast incorporates material trends  such as our acquisitions  reductions in workforce  loss of related party revenue and closings of facilities 
our forecast also incorporates the future cash flow benefits expected from our continued efforts to increase efficiencies and reduce redundancies 
nonetheless  our forecast includes the need to raise additional funds 
our cash flow estimates are based upon attaining certain levels of sales  maintaining budgeted levels of operating expenses  collections of accounts receivable and maintaining our current borrowing line with silicon valley bank among other assumptions  including the improvement in the overall macroeconomic environment 
however there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet such assumptions 
our sales estimate includes revenue from new and existing customers  which may not be realized  and we may be required to further reduce expenses if budgeted sales are not attained 
we may be unsuccessful in reducing expenses in proportion to any shortfall in projected sales and our estimate of collections of accounts receivable may be hindered by our customers ability to pay 
in addition  we are currently involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings 
while we believe that the allegations against us in each of these matters are without merit  and that we have a meritorious defense in each  we are not able to predict the final outcomes of any of these matters and the effect  if any  on our financial condition 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of these matters  we could be required to pay substantial amounts of cash and or shares of our common stock to the other parties 
the amount and timing of any such payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated under various capital and operating leases for facilities and equipment 
minimum annual rental commitments under operating leases and other commitments are as follows less than after description total year years years years in thousands short long term debt interest on debt a capital leases operating leases minimum bandwidth commitments maintenance for hardware software property leases b a amounts do not include interest on the accounts receivable financing line  as interest rate is variable 
b amounts exclude certain common area maintenance and other property charges that are not included within the lease payment 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews the estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
we believe these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue consists of monthly fees for web site and internet application management  hosting  colocations and professional services 
the company also derives revenue from the sale of software and related maintenance contracts 
reimbursable expenses charged to clients are included in revenue and cost of revenue 
application management  hosting and colocation revenue other than installation fees is billed and recognized over the term of the contract  generally one to three years  based on actual usage 
payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period such services are provided 
revenue from professional services  application management  hosting and colocation revenue is recognized on either a time and material basis as the services are performed or under the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts 
we generally sell our professional services under contracts with terms ranging from one to five years 
when current contract estimates indicate that a loss is probable  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated service costs of the contract exceed the estimated revenue that will be generated by the contract 
unbilled accounts receivable represents revenue for services performed that have not been billed 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue from the sale of software is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in instances where the company also provides application management and hosting services in conjunction with the sale of software  software revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the 
table of contents expected customer relationship period 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors 
if it is determined subsequent to our initial evaluation and at any time during the arrangement that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized as cash is received 
due to the nature of our service arrangements  we provide written notice of termination of services  typically days in advance of disconnecting a customer 
revenue for services rendered during this notification period is generally recognized on a cash basis as collectability is not considered probable at the time the services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally do not require collateral or other security against trade receivables 
we make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and consider historical bad debts  customer and industry concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for of the balance of customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
for all other customer accounts  we reserve for of the balance over days old and of all other customer balances 
changes in economic conditions or the financial viability of our customers may result in additional provisions for doubtful accounts in excess of our current estimate 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  subject to amortization and depreciation  including customer lists and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value less disposal costs 
property and equipment is primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  computer and office equipment and software licenses 
intangible assets consist of customer lists 
we review the valuation of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred  we review the valuation of goodwill on an interim basis 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
impairment losses are recognized in operations
