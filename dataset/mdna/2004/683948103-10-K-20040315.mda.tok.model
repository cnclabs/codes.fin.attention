item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide specialty pharmacy services and home infusion and other healthcare services to patients at home or at other alternate sites such as infusion suites and physician s offices 
we contract with managed care organizations and other third party payors who reimburse us for the services we provide to their subscribers 
our services are provided through our nationwide network of company owned and franchised pharmacies  which numbered as of december  we have three distinct service lines specialty pharmacy  infusion and related healthcare services and other 
summarized information about revenue for each service line is provided in the following table amounts in thousands years ended december  amounts of total amounts of total amounts of total revenue specialty pharmacy    infusion and related healthcare services   other    total revenue    the year was a year of growth for our company  with acquisitions as the primary driver of that growth 
we completed five acquisitions during the period from march through july of  continuing our acquisitions momentum from the prior year 
the two most significant acquisitions in were the purchase of a majority interest in a specialty pharmacy business in houston  texas and the purchase of a large  infusion pharmacy business in the minneapolis st 
paul area 
the texas specialty pharmacy increased our synagis business and allowed us to increase our hemophilia services  while the minneapolis st 
paul acquisition provided us with a significant presence in this previously untapped market 
beginning in august  we focused on completing the integration of the businesses acquired in and  and accordingly  completed no new acquisitions through the remainder of the year 
in  we also expanded our specialty pharmacy business  focusing dually on partnering with specialty pharmaceutical manufacturers to help launch their new products and expanding upon our relationships with managed care organizations to provide specialty pharmaceuticals to their members 
to increase our effectiveness and overall attractiveness as a partner to specialty pharmaceutical manufacturers  we opened a specialty drug distribution pharmacy in ann arbor  michigan late in in order to provide a central  coordinated delivery point for certain pharmaceuticals 
we also grew revenue by under our most significant managed care contract  with blue cross and blue shield of florida 
overall  the revenue growth from acquisitions and expansion of specialty pharmacy services resulted in record revenue of million and record net income of million 
while was a year of growth  the year was a year of transition for our company 
rick smith joined option care as our president and chief operating officer in may and under his leadership we completed an operational restructuring in the third and fourth quarters 
our focus during was on streamlining the organization  improving the effectiveness of our sales efforts  and improving the strength of our internal policies and practices to lay the groundwork for future growth 
accordingly  we chose not to pursue additional business acquisitions in but instead focus on improving the overall performance of our existing company owned pharmacies 
difficulties related to the integration of certain of our prior acquisitions in texas led to a million bad debt charge in the third quarter of  resulting in net income of million for the year compared to million in the prior year 
however  during our revenue and gross profit grew by and  respectively  from a combination of same store sales increases and from the impact of our acquisitions 
also  with the exception of our texas offices  cash collections were strong in due to our refocusing on billing and collections practices and performance  allowing us to pay off our outstanding credit facility balance which was million at the start of the year 
we believe that the overall restructuring and operational improvements completed in have prepared us to once again pursue strategic acquisition opportunities  and we anticipate growth in revenue and net income in most of our revenue is generated from managed care contracts and other agreements with commercial third party payors 
we have one managed care contract  with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc bc bs of florida  that represents a significant portion of our revenue 
in the years  and  respectively   and of our revenue was related to this contract 
as of december  and  of option care s accounts receivable was due from bc bs of florida 
our contract with bc bs of florida is terminable by either party on days notice and  unless terminated  renews annually each september for an additional one year term 
this contract renewed in september with no material changes 
we also generate revenue from governmental healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
for the years  and  respectively   and of our revenue came from these governmental healthcare programs 
for  of our revenue was from medicaid and was from state medicare programs 
as of december  and  respectively  and of total accounts receivable were due from these programs 
many of the pharmaceuticals we provide are reimbursed at some percentage of the average wholesale price awp of the pharmaceuticals 
awp for most pharmaceuticals is compiled and published by private companies  including first databank  inc however  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of is changing the way in which covered outpatient drugs are reimbursed by the medicare program 
starting in january  payment for most drugs covered by medicare will decrease to of the average wholesale price awp determined as of april  beginning in  reimbursement for non self administered drugs furnished to patients in conjunction with other medicare covered services will be set at either of the average sales price asp or through a competitive acquisition program to be phased in beginning in the eventual replacement of awp by asp as the standard measure for determining reimbursement by the medicare program could an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition  potentially reducing our revenue and narrowing our gross profit margins 
while our medicare exposure is relatively small  the adoption of asp by state medicaid programs or by managed care organization and other private payors could have a more material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions have been and will continue to be an integral part of our overall growth strategy 
we invested million in cash in to acquire the minority interest of one of our subsidiaries  complete one minor acquisition and pay additional consideration toward the purchase price of other prior years acquisitions 
effective april   we acquired the remaining equity interest in infusion specialties  inc the total purchase price was million 
we paid million in cash in may and have recorded million in additional future consideration subject to the resolution of certain contingencies related to the collection of accounts receivable 
during we also made two scheduled payments totaling million toward our asset purchase of a home infusion business in the minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan area 
in addition  we paid a total of  to settle our remaining obligations related to three prior acquisitions and paid  for a small acquisition 
early in  we completed two small acquisitions in markets where we already had a presence  and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions 
during  in response to passage of the sarbanes oxley act of  we created an internal audit department that reports to the audit committee of our board of directors 
the internal audit department s primary purpose is to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and provide feedback to management in order to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  the internal audit department has been involved in projects to improve corporate governance at the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and their related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the following should be read in conjunction with note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies and with the other notes to consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and contractual adjustments our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and the provision of related nursing services to patients outside the hospital at alternate site settings 
most of this revenue is billed under managed care or other contracts  with a smaller amount billed under government healthcare programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
we bill upon receipt of all required documentation from payors  physicians and our staff 
at the end of any period  a portion of our earned revenue remains unbilled awaiting completion of all documentation requirements 
billed and unbilled revenue is recorded net of contractual adjustments based on our interpretation of the terms of each managed care contract or government contract or pricing schedule  as loaded into our computerized billing and pharmacy management software systems 
in most cases  our contractual adjustments are calculated automatically by our billing system when the claim is billed  subject to review by the biller 
if our billing system cannot automatically generate the contractual adjustment for a given claim  we calculate the contractual adjustment manually and key the adjustment into our billing system when the claim is billed 
the contractual adjustments on unbilled amounts must be estimated manually through claim by claim analysis of the unbilled claims  by applying historical contractual adjustment percentages to the gross unbilled amounts  or a combination of the two methods 
the accuracy of our recorded net revenue is subject to the accuracy of payor information on file for each patient  and is also subject to our correct interpretation of each underlying contract with respect to reimbursement rates for the drugs and services we provided 
if changes or corrections to our estimates of net revenue prove to be necessary  we adjust net revenue in the period that such changes or corrections are identified 
such adjustments may have a positive or negative impact on the revenues and results of operations reported for those subsequent periods 
historically  such adjustments have not been significant to our statements of income 
accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are reported net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from private insurance carriers and government healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process  with each payor having its own claim requirements 
the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable is dependent upon complete and accurate patient intake  timely submission of clean claims to payors  and timely and effective follow up on outstanding claims 
our collection process involves multiple steps 
the first step is to bill each claim correctly  with proper coding  after having received all prerequisite authorizations from the patient s physician and insurance company  as applicable 
for claims submitted electronically  we receive electronic acceptance of the claim from the insurance company or governmental agency responsible for paying the claim 
this helps to assure collection of the account 
for mailed insurance claims or those for which electronic confirmation of acceptance is unavailable  the billing staff member responsible for that claim will contact the payor if payment is not received promptly 
the billing staff member will inquire as to the status of the claim  and will re bill the claim or provide additional information as requested by the payor 
upon rebilling  the billing staff member will contact the payor to confirm receipt of the re billed claim  and will follow up periodically until payment is received 
we write off accounts receivable as bad debts after all collection efforts have been exhausted  according to the following procedures 
our billing staff members review the status of their unpaid claims on a regular basis 
during that review  the billing staff member will identify the reason for non payment of a given claim 
should the reason relate to a correctable error with the claim itself  or incomplete or inadequate documentation provided to the payor  the billing staff member will attempt to address those issues and re submit a corrected claim or provide additional information to the payor  as appropriate 
in the event the claim error or documentation error cannot be corrected  the allowed time to correct and re submit the claim has expired  or the claim is not paid due to a payor related issue such as bankruptcy  the billing staff member will submit a formal request for write off 
the appropriate supervisor will review the request and authorize the claim to be written off if that supervisor agrees that the account is truly uncollectable 
the identity of the appropriate supervisor to authorize a write off is determined based on the reporting structure within each office and based on the dollar amount to be written off  with higher level authorization required for larger dollar write offs 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on several factors  including our past accounts receivable collection history  the aging of our accounts receivable at the end of each period as reported to us through our computerized billing systems  our mix of business  and the financial condition of our payors 
we evaluate historical write off percentages by aging category to help us determine the appropriate reserve needed at each balance sheet date based on the aging of our receivables at that date 
we also take into account certain internal factors  such as computer systems conversions  office acquisitions and consolidations  and operational changes within our billing and reimbursement function 
although we believe that our estimation of the net value of our accounts receivable is reasonable  we continually monitor our accounts receivable and our methods for calculating the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  and we adjust our allowances and calculation methods as needed 
if actual collections differ from our estimates  we may need to establish an additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets we record goodwill from our acquisitions equal to the excess of the total cost of the acquisitions over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  effective january  we no longer amortize goodwill but instead test our goodwill at least annually for impairment 
since we operate in one business segment  we test for goodwill impairment on a company wide basis 
therefore  our method of impairment testing consists of comparing the market value of our company to its book value 
the market value is equal to the current value per share of our common stock  times the total number of shares outstanding 
we test goodwill for impairment annually each october st  or whenever we identify events or conditions that could potentially result in impairment of our goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily consist of non compete agreements and managed care contracts 
these intangible assets are amortized straight line over periods ranging from two to five years 
their amortization period equals their estimated useful lives  or in the case of non compete agreements  the amortization period equals their contractual term 
computer software developed costs software developed for sale to external customers our subsidiary  mbi  has internally developed a computer software program  iemphsys  designed specifically for management of home infusion pharmacy businesses 
iemphsys has been designed both for external sale to independent home infusion businesses and for internal use by our company owned pharmacies 
we account for software designed for sale to external customers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
accordingly  the costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility for the software program have been capitalized 
these costs include coding and testing performed subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
capitalization of the software program costs ceased when the product became available for general release to customers 
the annual amortization expense for the software program is computed using the greater of a the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated life of the product  including the period being reported on 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized capitalized costs of the software program are compared to its net realizable value 
if the estimated net realizable value of the software program exceeds its unamortized capitalized costs  we will write off the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceeds the net realizable value 
software developed for internal use only we have developed and are developing various software products designed only for use by us in the operation of our business 
such software development projects are accounted for in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa 
we account for software development costs for internal use software accounting to the following criteria a computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed  b once the capitalization criteria under the sop have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software project  and interest costs incurred when developing computer software for internal use are capitalized and  c once the product is operative  internal and external training costs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
we amortize capitalized costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software 
we will recognize impairment on the capitalized computer software developed for internal use  if one of the following conditions is present a the internal use software is not expected to provide substantive service potential  b a significant change occurs in the extent or manner  in which the software is used or is expected to be used  c a significant change is made or will be made to the software program  and d costs of developing or modifying internal use computer software significantly exceed the amount originally expected to develop or modify the software

business acquisitions  net of disposals  accounted for another million of the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily due to a million same store sales increase in infusion therapy services  partially offset by declines in other healthcare services such as durable medical equipment sales 
overall  comparing to  our same store sales growth rate was for our core services of specialty pharmacy and infusion therapy 
for  option care s revenue was million  an increase of million  or  from the million in this growth in revenue was driven primarily by acquisitions  by increased penetration of existing managed care relationships  and by the establishment of new managed care and manufacturer relationships 
pharmacies acquired in and accounted for approximately million  or  of the revenue growth 
increases in same store sales accounted for the remaining million in revenue growth 
approximately half of this million was from increased sales of specialty pharmaceuticals by our florida pharmacies and was primarily derived from our managed care contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida 
the remaining increase was due to our efforts to increase market penetration of our specialty pharmacy services  and due to increased patient census for our core home infusion therapies 
specialty pharmacy revenue specialty pharmacy revenue consists of distribution of specialty pharmaceutical products to patient s home or other non hospital settings such as physician s offices on behalf of manufacturers  managed care companies or  to a lesser extent  government healthcare programs 
our specialty pharmacy revenue is derived only from sales by our company owned pharmacies 
overall  our specialty pharmacy revenue increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the prior year 
of this million increase  million was related to acquisitions completed in several factors contributed to the remaining million increase 
we continued to generate increased revenue from synagis  a seasonal drug for the prevention of respiratory synctial virus rsv in premature infants 
synagis revenue increased by million over the prior year  reaching million in the synagis season runs from approximately october through april of each year 
option care continues to be a preferred provider of this product on behalf of its manufacturer  medimmune  inc also  during the third and fourth quarters of  we began to generate revenue from xolair  a newly approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic asthma 
we have partnered with genentech and novartis pharmaceuticals corporation to participate in the launch of this product  and anticipate continued growth in xolair revenue in in addition to increased sales of synagis and xolair  we saw increases in sales of a variety of specialty drugs throughout our network of company owned pharmacies 
this was due to increased cross selling of our infusion and specialty pharmacy services and from expanded utilization under some of our specialty drug only contracts with managed care payors 
our principal managed care contract  with blue cross blue shield of florida  has reached the mature stage 
accordingly  the specialty pharmacy revenue generated from this contract remained consistent with the prior year 
we continue to seek additional managed care contracts to further expand our specialty pharmacy revenue 
in  specialty pharmacy revenue was million  an increase of million  or  over the large increase in specialty pharmacy revenue was divided in near equal proportion among three sources increases in same store sales  increased volume under our specialty pharmacy contracts  primarily our contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida  and incremental revenue from and acquisitions 
several factors contributed to the overall increase  including efforts to cross sell specialty pharmaceuticals to our existing infusion pharmacy managed care clients  and due to volume increases under our existing specialty pharmacy contracts 
we also expanded our specialty pharmacy product line through acquisitions and through partnering with specialty drug manufacturers  and increased market penetration for existing products  such as synagis 
infusion and related healthcare services revenue infusion and related healthcare services includes the provision of home infusion therapies  as well as respiratory therapy and durable medical equipment sales and rentals rt dme and home healthcare services 
infusion and related healthcare services revenue is derived only from sales by our company owned pharmacies 
in  revenue from infusion and related healthcare services increased by million  or  to million 
our core home infusion therapy revenue increased by approximately million  while other related healthcare services revenue declined by million as we scaled back our provision of rt dme and home healthcare services in certain markets 
of the million increase in infusion therapy revenue  approximately million was related to same store sales growth  while the remaining million was related to business acquisitions and disposals 
our same store sales growth rate for infusion therapy revenue was in in  our infusion and related healthcare services revenue was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in infusion and related healthcare services revenue was primarily from acquisitions 
current year same store infusion and related healthcare services revenues remained fairly consistent with the prior year 
other revenue other revenue consists of franchise related revenue and software revenue 
franchise related revenue consists of royalties and other fees generated from our franchise network  as well as vendor rebates earned from our franchises purchases under option care s contracts 
software revenue consists of mbi software license fees  support and training fees 
in  other revenue was million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to  in franchise termination fees and  in non compete fees recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the mutually agreed termination and sale of one of our franchises 
additional revenue amounts will be recorded in related to our covenant not to complete against  and to provide support to  the buyer of this business 
our franchise royalty revenue was million in compared to million in this increase was caused by higher cash collections within our existing franchise network  as well as from the franchising of our grand junction  colorado and bullhead city  arizona pharmacies during the first half of mbi software related revenue declined from million in to million in release of the new iemphsys software late in is expected to increase mbi s revenues in other revenue was million in  a decline of million  or  from the other revenue of million in other revenues for consisted of million in royalties and related fees from our franchises  million of mbi software sales and support  and  of other miscellaneous revenues 
royalty revenue declined  in due to a small reduction in the number of franchise locations during that year 
software sales declined slightly in as mbi began beta testing a new browser based software which was released in cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of the cost of goods sold and services provided to our patients 
cost of goods primarily consists of the cost of pharmaceutical products  durable medical equipment and ancillary medical supplies provided to our patients 
cost of service primarily includes the salaries and wages and related costs of the nursing and pharmacy services we provide  as well as the costs to delivery pharmaceutical products and durable medical equipment to our patients 
while we are able to separately identify our costs between goods and services  we cannot separate our revenue accordingly 
typically  we provide both pharmaceutical products and nursing and other services to our patients in one cohesive delivery of care  and a portion of our revenue consists of per diem payments that include reimbursement for both goods and services 
therefore  we do not separately report revenue from products versus revenue from services 
cost of goods for the year  cost of goods was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue in the dollar increase was due to our growth in revenue during  particularly from the sale of specialty pharmaceuticals  and from the effect of acquisitions completed during the basis point increase in cost of goods as a percentage of revenue was due to the proportionately greater increase in specialty pharmacy revenue versus infusion therapy revenue 
specialty pharmaceuticals are higher in cost and generate a lower margin than infusion drugs 
the shift towards specialty pharmaceutical outweighed the impact of negotiating lower drug pricing with our principal supplier  which lowered our overall costs 
we receive rebates from various drug and medical supply manufacturers based on the volume of purchases by our company owned pharmacies and our franchised pharmacies 
those rebates earned from purchases by our company owned pharmacies are recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
for the year  vendor rebates reduced our cost of goods sold by million compared to million in the prior year 
in addition to rebates  we also receive prompt payment discounts from a number of our drug and medical supply vendors 
in  we recorded approximately  in prompt payment discounts compared to  in the prior year 
the fluctuation in rebates and discounts is related to structural changes within our agreements with manufacturers and vendors 
cost of goods sold was million for the year  an increase of million  or  over the cost of goods sold of million in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to acquisitions as well as same store sales growth  particularly in the sale of specialty pharmacy products 
same store sales growth accounted for million  or of the increase  while acquisitions accounted for approximately million  or of the increase 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold increased from of revenue for the year ended december  to of revenue for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the larger rate of growth in the sale of specialty pharmacy products compared to the growth in sale of infusion and related healthcare products in compared to the prior year 
specialty pharmacy products have a higher unit cost and produce a lower margin than infusion and related healthcare products  so as our business shifted more toward specialty pharmacy sales  our cost of goods increased as a percentage of revenue 
cost of service our cost of service for the year was million compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  cost of service was equal to in each period 
slight increases in salaries and wages and related costs during the current year caused the overall cost of service percentage to remain steady in spite of the faster growth rate in specialty pharmacy services  which have a smaller cost of service component 
cost of service was million for the year  an increase of million  or  over the cost of service of million for the million increase in cost of service was primarily due to acquisitions  which accounted for million  or of the increase 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of service declined from in to in this decline in percentage is attributable to the faster growth in specialty pharmacy services revenue versus infusion and related healthcare services revenue during the period 
specialty pharmacy services generate higher revenue and require minimal services compared to infusion and related healthcare services 
gross profit the following table sets forth the gross profit margin for each of our service lines for the periods indicated years ended december  gross profit margin specialty pharmacy infusion and related healthcare services other total gross profit margin our gross profit was million  or of revenue in compared to million  or or revenue  in the prior year 
the growth in our gross profit and the small decline in gross profit margin are both due to our growth in specialty pharmacy revenue  which outpaced our growth in infusion and related healthcare services revenue in the gross profit margins of each of our service lines remained fairly stable 
within both specialty pharmacy and infusion and related healthcare services  the gross profit margin changes are primarily related to our mix of drugs and therapies 
our gross profit was  representing an increase of million  or  over our gross profit of million in the increase in gross profit was the result of our revenue increase of million 
as a percentage of revenue  our overall gross profit margin declined from in to in this decline is due to stronger sales of specialty pharmaceuticals  which typically have a higher cost and lower margin than home infusion drugs and services 
the gross profit margins of our two primary service lines  infusion and related healthcare services and specialty pharmacy  remained fairly stable year to year 
for infusion and related healthcare services  our gross profit margin increased from in to in this increase was due to changes in therapy mix 
our specialty pharmacy gross profit margin increased from in to for the increase is also due to changes in product mix  notably the increase in sales of blood factor products  which have a higher gross profit margin than most of our other specialty pharmacy products 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over the largest component in the increase was wages and related expenses  which increased by approximately million 
of this million increase in wages and related expenses  approximately million is attributable to acquisitions completed during within our ongoing operations  we expanded staffing to meet operating needs in certain areas such as billing and reimbursement and internal audit  and also experienced increases in employee health insurance costs 
we also incurred additional selling  general and administrative expenses related to our roll out of mbi s new software  iemphsys 
in addition  the operational restructuring undertaken in the second half of resulted in approximately million in severance and related expenses  and another  of other selling  general and administrative expenses 
other selling  general and administrative expenses that increased in the current year included business insurance costs due to an overall hardening of the insurance market  and depreciation and amortization expense due to a  write down for an internally developed software product that is being re engineered 
acquisitions accounted for approximately  of the total million increase in non wage related selling  general and administrative costs 
total selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
acquisitions accounted for approximately million  or  of this increase  through overhead expenses incurred directly by the acquired offices and through incremental increases in corporate staffing necessary to oversee the management of their operations 
of the remaining million increase in operating expenses  approximately million was related to a charge for the planned disposal of our company owned pharmacies in bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado 
provision for doubtful accounts in  our provision for doubtful accounts increased compared to the prior year as a result of a bad debt charge of million taken in the quarter ended september  overall  our provision for doubtful accounts was million in  an increase of million  or  over the prior year provision of million 
as a percentage of revenue  our provision for doubtful accounts equaled of revenue in compared to in the bad debt charge of million in the current year was related to the accounts receivable of our texas offices 
we completed multiple acquisitions in the dallas and houston markets during causing us to have multiple pharmacy locations in the same markets 
during  we began the process of consolidating our operations into one office in each market 
in the dallas area  in we consolidated the operations of four offices into one 
a variety of operational problems related to the consolidation of these offices created the need for additional bad debt reserves 
many of these problems affected the billing and reimbursement function 
the four predecessor offices were not all utilizing the same billing system 
as part of the consolidation process  we transferred all data from these four offices onto one data system 
during the data conversion  some of the accounts receivable data was lost and could not be recaptured  reducing our ability to collect the accounts and increasing the likelihood of bad debt write offs 
in addition  in the process of consolidating the billing and reimbursement function  staff reductions and employee turnover decreased the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
often those employees responsible for collecting our accounts receivable were unfamiliar with the accounts  having not billed them 
we also experienced difficulty in integrating staff from the four predecessor offices into one cohesive unit  evidenced by an increase in process errors  such as failure to obtain proper authorization before billing claims and loading incorrect contract fee schedules into our billing software 
while the long term effect of our consolidation efforts in texas will be to improve efficiency  the operational challenges caused by the consolidation weakened the effectiveness of our billing and collection process and led to an increase in bad debt write offs and reserve requirements 
after a detailed analysis of the collectability of the outstanding accounts  we determined in the third quarter of that a million additional provision for doubtful accounts was necessary to adequately reserve for potential write offs 
we have since made several personnel changes and implemented operational enhancements in these offices  designed to help us more closely monitor billing and collections performance to improve the collectability of current and future revenue 
in  our provision for doubtful accounts was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the primary reason for this increase was our increase in revenue in versus the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  the provision for doubtful accounts increased from in to in there were two main factors that caused this increase 
first of all  in the fourth quarter of we determined that additional bad debt reserves were necessary for the accounts receivable of our texas offices 
difficulties encountered in our process of consolidating and integrating the operations of multiple pharmacies from multiple acquisitions  particularly in the dallas area  hampered our ability to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in those offices 
the second factor that caused an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts was a fourth quarter charge equaling approximately  related to the planned disposal of our bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado offices 
this charge was based on our expectation that we would retain ownership of the accounts receivable upon disposal of the offices  but would no longer employ the billing and collections staff originally responsible for collecting those accounts 
we recorded a charge equal to our estimate of the additional amount of accounts receivable expected to be uncollectible absent staff familiar with those accounts 
the  charge represents an incremental reserve in addition to normal historical requirements 
we sold our grand junction  colorado office on march  and sold our bullhead city  arizona office on may  goodwill amortization we recorded no goodwill amortization expense in in keeping with the provision of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill but instead test our goodwill annually for impairment 
we completed our annual test for goodwill impairment on october  and identified no impairment of our goodwill at that date  or subsequently 
in the prior year  we recorded goodwill amortization expense of  related to the planned disposal of our pharmacies in grand junction  colorado and bullhead city  arizona 
these disposals were completed on march  and may   respectively 
goodwill amortization expense decreased from million in to  in in  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october  and identified no impairment at that time 
however  in the fourth quarter of we recognized a  impairment charge related to the planned disposal of our company owned pharmacies in bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado 
we adopted the non amortization provision of sfas no 
as of january  prior to adoption of this provision  in we recognized million in goodwill amortization expense  none of which was the result of impairment 
interest expense interest expense in was  representing an increase of  over the prior year 
the interest was primarily from borrowings against our revolving credit facility with jp morgan business credit corporation 
we entered the year with approximately million outstanding under this facility  but ended the year with a zero balance as a result of strong operational cash flow of million during interest expense for was  compared to million in this decline was due to lower debt levels resulting from the underwritten public offering of stock we completed in october prior to the completion of this stock offering  we had accumulated nearly million in debt due to funding the acquisitions we completed in the first half of the stock offering generated million in cash  a portion of which was used to pay off this debt balance in the fourth quarter of our interest expense was mostly incurred during the second half of the year  as we borrowed on our credit facility to finance the acquisition of allina health system s infusion pharmacy operations in july income tax provision our provision for income taxes was million in versus million in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of pre tax income  our income tax provision rate was nearly unchanged  at in compared to in in  our overall federal income tax rate was slightly lower due to our lower pretax income in that year 
however  we had increased business in states with higher state income tax rates and an increase in various non deductible expenses in  more than offsetting the decline in our federal income tax rate 
in  our income tax provision increased by million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase approximates our increase in income before income taxes in compared to as a percentage of income before income taxes  our provision increased from in to in this slight increase was due to an increase in business in states with higher state income tax rates 
net income and earnings per share our net income for the year was million compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  our net income was equal to of revenue in compared to of revenue in the decline in our net income was primarily due to the bad debt and restructuring charges totaling million pretax  taken in the quarter ended september  increases in various operational costs such as business insurance and administrative salaries and related costs also played a part in the net income decline 
our diluted earnings per share was equal to in compared to in the prior year 
diluted shares increased from approximately million in to million in  primarily due to new shares issued to employees who participated in our employee stock purchase plan and shares issued as a result of stock option exercises 
our net income was million  which represented an increase of million  or  over the million net income in this increase was primarily due to expansion of our business through acquisitions and emphasis on increasing market penetration for specialty pharmaceuticals 
net income equaled of revenue in compared to of revenue in this decline in net income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a million charge related to the decision to dispose of our bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado offices and to our increase in provision for doubtful accounts  particularly for our dallas  texas area operations 
these factors were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense 
the increase in net income resulted in a increase in earnings per diluted share  which climbed to in versus in diluted shares increased from million for to million for this million share increase was primarily due to the effect of our underwritten public offering of stock completed in october the full effect of this offering was reflected in our weighted average share counts  while only about of the effect was reflected in the prior year share counts 
other factors increasing our diluted shares outstanding included stock option exercises and the issuance of shares under option care s employee stock purchase plan 
all share and per share amounts presented in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to reflect the for stock split we completed in april cash flows cash provided by operations net cash flow provided by operations in was million 
our net income in the year and improved cash collection performance  which led to a reduction in our days sales outstanding  were the main reasons for the improvement 
overall collections of accounts receivable throughout the company were strong  despite difficulties in some of our texas locations 
we re focused on billing and collections in  reducing our gross accounts receivable from million as of december  to million at december  in addition to improvements in our overall billing and collection performance  the decline in accounts receivable and increase in operational cash flow was also due to the increase in specialty pharmacy services revenue as compared to infusion and related healthcare services revenue 
specialty pharmacy revenue tends to have a shorter collection cycle than infusion and related healthcare services revenue 
two line items on our consolidated statement of cash flows were impacted by a large inventory purchase at the end of in order to reach a purchase volume threshold that would allow us to receive a larger percentage rebate on certain specialty drugs  we acquired extra stock of these drugs in december this purchase increased both our inventory and our accounts payable as of december   and were the primary causes of the cash flow changes in these balance sheet items during net cash flow provided by operations in was million 
the positive cash flow from operations is primarily due to our net income of million during the year 
cash flow from operations was less than our net income due to an increase in accounts receivable during this increase was primarily due to the effect of acquisitions completed during and late in acquisitions used million of cash flow from operations  while existing operations provided million of cash flow from operations 
for acquisitions  growth in accounts receivable balances due to integration and consolidation issues  particularly in our dallas  texas offices  was the main cause of their negative operating cash flow 
for our existing business  the million cash flow from operations was due to our increased net income  combined with a reduction in our days sales outstanding as of december  compared to december  this reduction was partially due to the increase in specialty pharmacy revenue  which tends to have a shorter collection cycle than home infusion and other related services 
in  operations used million in cash flow 
accounts receivable growth spawned by acquisitions was the reason for our negative operating cash flow 
we completed nine separate acquisitions in for the majority of these acquisitions  we did not purchase accounts receivable from the sellers  causing those acquired offices to have initial negative operating cash flows until we started collecting on post acquisition revenue 
for most of our acquisitions  we did acquire accounts receivable  minimizing initial negative operating cash flows in that year 
cash used in investing activities we used million in cash in investing activities in the primary use of cash was for acquisition payments 
we used million in cash during the year  of which million was related to additional consideration for prior year acquisitions and  was for a small acquisition completed in march the largest cash outflow was million paid to acquire the remaining minority interest in infusion specialties  inc  a specialty pharmacy business that we acquired a majority interest in during in addition  we made scheduled payments totaling million to complete our purchase of a large home infusion business in the minneapolis st 
paul area 
we also made earnout payments of approximately  for various other prior acquisitions 
during  we spent million for the purchase of equipment and other long term assets 
of the total current year expenditures  million was spent on infrastructure improvements such as office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements  million for revenue producing rental equipment  million for computer hardware and software and  for software development projects  including mbi s development of iemphsys 
net cash flow used in investing activities for was million 
we used million in to fund our five new acquisitions and the additional consideration due on prior years acquisitions 
we also used million in cash during to acquire equipment and other fixed assets  including million for infusion pumps and other revenue producing medical equipment 
in  we purchased a large number of infusion pumps to replace rented pumps in order to save on overall cost 
of the equipment purchases  we also spent million on the development of software  primarily mbi s new iemphsys pharmacy management software system 
another million was spent on leasehold improvements related to the build out of our new corporate offices and on the relocation of several of our company owned pharmacies 
the remaining million was used to upgrade computer systems and for various other office furniture and equipment 
net cash flow used in investing activities in was million 
we used million to fund acquisition activities  as we completed nine business acquisitions in that year 
we also used a net million to acquire equipment and other fixed assets  consisting of million used to purchase new assets  less  received from the sale of existing assets 
of the million spent in the current year  million was spent on new software development projects  million was spent for infrastructure improvements such as computer and office equipment  and  was spent to purchase medical equipment for rental to patients 
cash used in financing activities in  we used million cash in financing activities 
the primary use of cash in was to pay off the outstanding balance on our credit facility with jp morgan business credit corporation  which was million as of december  we were able to pay off this balance due to our positive operating cash flow of million in in  in addition to the use of cash to pay down our credit facility balance  we also used approximately  at the end of the year to repurchase shares of our common stock 
offsetting these uses of cash  we generated million in cash in from the issuance of common stock to participants in our employee stock purchase plan and from our employees stock option exercises throughout the year 
in  financing activities provided million in cash 
we borrowed a net million under our credit and security agreement with jp morgan business credit corporation to fund acquisition activities during the year  primarily our july purchase of a large home infusion business in the minneapolis st 
paul area 
the credit and security agreement became effective on march   and we used  in cash to pay loan origination costs and related fees 
we also used  to pay scheduled installments on capital leases and notes and loans payable 
during  we generated million from issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and from employee stock option exercises 
in  financing activities provided million in cash 
in october of that year  we completed an underwritten public offering of stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
the proceeds generated from the stock offering allowed us to repay our outstanding credit facility balance and eliminate our cash overdraft 
our credit facility balance was million and our cash overdraft position was  as of december  in addition  during we generated million from our employee s exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan 
accounts receivable the following table sets forth our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding as of december for each year presented dollar amounts in thousands trade accounts receivable    less allowance for doubtful accounts    trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for doubtful accounts  as percentage of trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding days sales outstanding is based on trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  and is calculated using the exhaustion method  whereby the net accounts receivable balance is exhausted against each preceding month s or partial month s net revenue 
the days sales outstanding calculation excludes revenue not related to patient care  such as franchise related revenue and software license and support revenue 
the following tables set forth the percentage breakdown of our trade accounts receivable by aging category and by major payor type as of december for each year presented accounts receivable percentages by aging category aged days aged days aged days aged over days total accounts receivable percentages by major payor type managed care and other payors medicare and medicaid total our trade accounts receivable  net of bad debt reserves  was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the decline in trade accounts receivable in the current year is primarily due to a combination of improved cash collection performance in most of our pharmacies and the million bad debt charge taken in the quarter ended september  related to our texas accounts receivable 
we wrote off million of these accounts during the quarter ended december  for the year  our company wide bad debt write offs approximately doubled  increasing from million in to million in one of our primary objectives in is to reverse this trend 
operational changes in our texas offices have been put in place to allow us to more closely monitor the performance of these offices in terms of overall billing and collections practices  designed to help us avoid future write offs 
our accounts receivable balance  net of bad debt reserves  was million as of december  compared to million as of december  this increase is primarily due to higher revenue in the quarter ended december  compared to the corresponding quarter in resulting from acquisitions competed in and increases in synagis revenue in compared to the prior year 
our days sales outstanding dso  calculated using the exhaustion method for our accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  declined from as of december  to days as of december  since we calculate dso net of allowance for doubtful accounts  both cash collections performance and changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts affect the number 
improved cash collections performance by most of our pharmacies was part of the reason for our decline in dso in  combined with an increase in specialty pharmacy services  which has a faster collection cycle than infusion and related healthcare services 
the other major factor causing the decline in dso was the bad debt charge of million taken in the quarter ended september  our days sales outstanding dso improved from days as of december  to days at december  our dso was fairly high as of december  due to the large number of acquisitions completed late in that year 
following many of these acquisitions  we experienced initial delays in billing and collection of accounts receivable while waiting to receive the licensing necessary to allow submission of claims to our payors 
the decline in dso from as of december  to as of december  was due to the integration of our acquisitions  and also due to an increase in specialty pharmacy revenue  which typically has a faster collection cycle than infusion and related services revenue 
as of december   of our total accounts receivable is aged days or less compared to as of december  the decrease in age of our receivables is due to the same factors that caused our trade accounts receivable balance to decline improved overall billing and collection performance  increases in specialty pharmacy revenue  which has a faster collection cycle  and write offs of uncollectable accounts  particularly in our texas offices 
as of december  and  respectively  approximately and of our accounts receivable are related to government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
services provided under these programs represented and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a greater proportion of our infusion and related healthcare services revenue than our specialty pharmacy revenue is billable to government healthcare programs 
as previously mentioned infusion and related healthcare services revenue has a longer collection cycle than specialty pharmacy services 
this partially explains why government healthcare programs represent a higher percentage of our accounts receivable than our revenue 
in addition  state medicaid funding issues have lengthened the collection cycle on a portion of our government accounts receivable 
the majority of our accounts receivable is due from managed care companies and other commercial payors 
a very small percentage of our accounts are due from individual patients 
co payments are insignificant in our business  and we typically collect any co payments before or upon delivery of products and services to the patient 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more detail 
in thousands payments by period total operating leases      pharmaceutical purchase obligations   business acquisitions obligations   capital leases and other long term debt total contractual cash obligations     liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and acquisitions from operating cash flows  common stock offerings and borrowings 
our principal demands for liquidity are working capital  acquisition activities and debt service 
our total working capital as of december  was million  a decrease of million from the million in working capital as of december  the million decrease in working capital was primarily due to our use of available cash  generated from our strong cash collections in  to pay off our credit facility balance  which was million as of december  a contributing factor in the decline in working capital was our increase in reserves for the potentially uncollectable accounts receivable at our texas pharmacies 
although our working capital declined by million  this decline was more than offset by a million increase in our borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 
the improvement in collections of accounts receivable in allowed us to repay our outstanding credit facility balance  thereby increasing our borrowing availability from million as of december  to million as of december  we entered into a million revolving credit and security agreement on march  with jp morgan business credit corporation  jp morgan chase bank and lasalle bank  national association 
the credit facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants 
we paid a facility fee of approximately  upon signing the agreement 
the agreement provides for a commitment fee  calculated and paid quarterly on a sliding scale from to  based on the average daily unused portion of the facility 
for a fee  we may secure up to million in letters of credit 
depending on our level of borrowing under the agreement  we may select interest rates ranging from the eurodollar rate plus to  or the bank s reference rate plus to 
the agreement expires on march  availability under the facility is related to various percentages of our net outstanding accounts receivable and inventory balances  less certain capped and ineligible amounts  as defined in the agreement 
overall borrowings under the agreement will be limited to the lesser of the remaining availability under the agreement and the total allowable collateral borrowing base 
based on our accounts receivable and inventory balances as of december   we had borrowing availability of million 
as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the facility 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in addition to customary events of default  the facility provides that a change in control of the company would give rise to an event of default 
we are prohibited from declaring and paying cash dividends on our common stock under the credit facility 
on october   we entered into an amendment to the credit and security agreement to address the million special provision for doubtful accounts recorded in the quarter ended september  related to our texas accounts receivable 
the amendment allowed us to exclude the million charge when calculating our fixed charge coverage ratio in the current and subsequent quarters 
this change in calculation method allowed us to remain in compliance with our financial covenants for the quarters ended september  and december  we have one outstanding letter of credit at december  in the amount of million drawn in favor of arch specialty insurance company  our current provider of general and professional liability insurance coverage 
unless renewed  this letter of credit will expire on june  at december   we had million in cash and minimal debt 
we have been cash flow positive from operations in each of the last two years and anticipate remaining cash flow positive from continuing operations in as mentioned above  as of december   we have no outstanding balance under our million revolving credit and security agreement with jp morgan and we have borrowing availability of million 
the credit facility is asset backed  with our availability tied to various percentages of our accounts receivable and inventory balances 
this limits our ability to draw upon the entire million facility 
the credit facility is scheduled to expire on march  we intend to fund our future capital needs through operating cash flows and borrowings on our credit facility 
in the event that additional capital is required beyond the available balance under our current credit facility  we may not be able to obtain such capital from other sources on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our business strategy includes the selective acquisition of additional infusion pharmacies and other related healthcare businesses 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities  and view acquisitions as a key part of our growth strategy 
in the past  we have typically paid cash for our acquisitions  with the majority of the purchase price paid at closing 
for future acquisitions  we may utilize cash  common stock  or a combination of the two to pay the purchase price 
historically  we have used operating cash flows and  when necessary  borrowings on our credit facility to finance our past acquisitions 
we may require additional capital in excess of our current availability in order to complete future acquisitions 
it is impossible to predict the amount of capital that may be required for acquisitions  and there is no assurance that sufficient financing for these activities will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  which may limit our ability to complete desired acquisitions 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 which addresses the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
establishes an accounting model for costs associated with exit or disposal activities based on the fasb s conceptual framework for recognition and measurement of liabilities 
under this model  a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity should be initially recognized when it is incurred  that is  when the definition of a liability in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements  is met  and be measured at fair value  consistent with fasb concepts statement no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
costs covered by sfas no 
include one time termination benefits and certain contract termination costs  including operating lease termination costs that are associated with an exit or disposal activity 
the main effect of sfas no 
will be on the timing of recognition of such costs 
in many cases  those costs will be recognized as liabilities in periods following a commitment to a plan  not at the date of commitment 
sfas no 
also changes the recognition of one time termination benefits  such as severance pay or other termination indemnities  whenever the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period  as defined in the statement 
sfas no 
further addresses the accounting for other costs associated with an exit or disposal activity  such as costs to consolidate or close facilities and relocate employees 
a liability for such costs has to be recognized and measured at its fair value in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
requires that changes to the liability in subsequent periods resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of the estimated cash flows be recognized by increasing or decreasing the carrying amount of the liability using the credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to measure the liability initially 
the cumulative effect of such changes has to be reported in the income statement in the period of the change 
changes due solely to the passage of time should be recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as an expense in the income statement 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  earlier application of the statement was encouraged 
previously issued financial statements  including interim financial statements  cannot be restated 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to dispose of our company owned pharmacies in bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado 
we elected not to early apply the provisions of sfas no 
 but instead to account for these planned disposals under previous guidance provided by eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
accordingly  in the quarter ended december   upon commitment to a plan of disposal  we accrued a charge of million included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our statement of income for the year in  we subsequently reversed  of this accrual upon completion of the sales of these pharmacies 
fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on existing disclosure requirements for guarantees and clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin has had no effect on the accompanying financial statements 
fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
interpretation 
fin requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the adoption of fin has had no effect on the accompanying financial statements 
emerging issues task force eitf consideration received from a vendor by a customer or reseller 
eitf addresses how a customer or reseller should characterize and account for consideration received from a vendor  and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement 
the eitf reached consensus that consideration received by a customer from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be characterized as a reduction to cost of sales when recognized in the customer s income statement 
however  that presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as revenue or other income  as appropriate when recognized in the customer s income statement  or b a reimbursement of costs incurred by the customer to sell the vendor s products  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the customer s income statement 
the eitf further reached a consensus that cash consideration represents a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor and should be characterized as revenue or other income  as appropriate when recognized in the customer s income statement if the vendor receives  or will receive  an identifiable benefit goods or services in exchange for the consideration 
we receive consideration in the form of rebates and administration fees from vendors and from the manufacturers of the pharmaceuticals  medical supplies and equipment that we provide to patients 
a portion of these rebates is earned from our purchases  while a lesser portion is earned from purchases made by our franchisees 
in keeping with our current accounting policies  consideration received from manufacturers and vendors related to our purchases is accounted for as a reduction to cost of goods sold  and is recognized ratably over the period for which the rebate applies 
the portion of the consideration received from manufacturers and vendors that relates to purchases made by our franchisees is accounted for as revenue in our statements of income 
the rebates we receive related to our franchisees purchases represent consideration for services rendered by us to the vendors and manufacturers if the form of business referrals 
further  our cost of goods does not include the cost of goods purchased by our franchisees 
these factors  and our ability to reasonably estimate the benefit received from vendors and manufacturers from our franchisees purchases of their products  have led us to conclude that the portion of our rebates related to purchases made by our franchisees should be accounted for as revenue 
our current policies and practices related to accounting for consideration we receive from vendors is in compliance with the consensus reached in eitf therefore  adoption of eitf does not impact our accounting for consideration received from our vendors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we could be subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
we utilize a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in as of december   our fixed rate debt was  and we had no variable rate debt 
as of december   our fixed rate debt was  and our variable rate debt was million 
since we had no variable rate debt as of december   a one percent increase in interest rates would have no effect on our annual interest expense
