item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains certain statements that are forward looking statements as that term is defined under the act and releases issued by the securities and exchange commission 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate and other expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
the company s plans  described below  to launch a program in the fourth quarter of for an automotive supplier that could be as large as million is an example of a forward looking statement 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the million revenue value of the automotive contract is only an estimate  based on the automotive supplier s projected needs 
the company cannot guarantee that it will benefit at all from this contract  which is terminable by the automotive supplier for any reason  subject to a cancellation charge 
the company s revenues from this contract are directly dependent on the ability of the automotive supplier to develop  market  and sell its products in a timely  cost effective manner 
if the automotive supplier s needs decrease over the course of the contract  the company s estimated revenues from this contract may also decrease 
even if the company generates revenue from the project  the company cannot guarantee that the project will be profitable  particularly if revenues from the contract are less than expected 
although the company has met every milestone to date in advance of this program s launch  the company cannot guarantee the project s launch date 
other examples of these risks  uncertainties  and other factors include  without limitation  the following i economic conditions that affect sales of the products of the company s packaging customers  ii actions by the company s competitors and the ability of the company to respond to such actions  iii the ability of the company to obtain new customers and iv the ability of the company to execute and integrate favorable acquisitions 
in addition to the foregoing  the company s actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth elsewhere in this report and changes in general economic conditions  interest rates and the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
for example  in january  the company s largest customer in the component products segment informed the company that it no longer required the company s products because the customer could satisfy its need internally 
this customer accounted for approximately million in annual revenues in investment in and advances to affiliated partnership the company has a ownership interest in a realty limited partnership  united development company limited udt 
the company  as a result of adopting the provisions of fin  has consolidated the financial statements of udt as of december  prior to december   this investment was accounted for under the equity method at cost  plus the company s proportionate share of the limited partnership s income  less any distributions received from the limited partnership 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by the items as shown in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charge operating income loss total other expenses  net loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss overview ufp technologies is a leading designer and manufacturer of interior protective packaging solutions using molded fiber  vacuum formed plastics and molded and fabricated foam plastic products 
the company also designs and manufactures engineered component solutions using laminating  molding and fabricating technologies 
the company serves numerous markets including computer electronics  medical pharmaceutical  military  automotive  beauty  industrial and sports and leisure 
over the past several years  the company has downsized its operations in response to a general downturn in the economy as well as the loss of a large automotive program 
in particular  the company has consolidated its molded fiber packaging division into a single  large design and manufacturing facility in clinton  iowa  which it believes will create a far more efficient manufacturing structure 
it also consolidated three foam fabricating facilities in the southeast into two 
both of these downsizing efforts were in response to soft demand  primarily in the computer electronics industry 
management believes that the downturn in demand from this industry is at least partly permanent as a significant portion of computer electronics manufacturing has moved off shore 
while the company has been downsizing in the last three years  it has also been investing in growth opportunities for the future 
the company plans to launch a large  seven year  million automotive program in the fourth quarter of the company has been preparing for this program for almost two years  including investing in human resources  machinery and manufacturing space that have resulted in significant operating losses in that should continue for the first three quarters of the company has also invested in the sales and marketing area  creating a vice president of sales and marketing position and hiring several industry veterans to strengthen its sales team 
management believes that these investments leave the company poised for sales growth in and beyond

the amount of the net deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term  if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced

additionally  the company may consider the acquisition of companies  technologies or products in  which are complementary to its business

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the packaging industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company has reviewed these policies with its audit committee revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment which is typically when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of its obligation is complete  its price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and the company is reasonably assured of collecting 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
the company analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
long lived assets and intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
recoverability of long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then long lived assets are written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
recoverability of goodwill is determined under a two step process as described in sfas the fair value of reporting units determined under step one is also based on a discounted cash flow model 
at december   no impairment has been identified 
forecasted cash flows are based upon numerous assumptions used by management  such as revenue growth  margins and asset management 
for purposes of this analysis  the company reviews its internal forecasts and external data 
the external data consist of data available from customer and competitor commentary  as well as industry forecasts of future revenue growth 
the estimates of expected cash flows require the company to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of the company s control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or economic conditions were to further deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  with a resulting charge to results of operations 
inventory the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company fully reserves for inventories deemed obsolete 
the company performs periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through its planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required with a resulting charge to operations 
deferred income taxes the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and equity prices 
at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank accounts in us dollars  and their valuation would not be affected by market risk 
the company has four debt instruments where interest is based upon the prime rate and or libor and  therefore  future operations could be affected by interest rate changes  however  the company believes that the market risk of the debt is minimal
