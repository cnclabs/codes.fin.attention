we manufacture power products in a siliconix owned class six inch wafer fabrication facility in santa clara  california 
we subcontract wafer fabrication through an affiliate of vishay in itzehoe  germany 
a subcontractor in japan manufactures our power products 
the manufacturing of wafers for analog switches and multiplexers is done in santa clara and through an outsourcing arrangement with a foundry in dresden  germany 
a subcontractor in beijing  china manufactures small signal transistors 
we use additional fabrication subcontractors in taiwan and the united states for selected processes 
assembly and test facilities include a siliconix owned facility in kaohsiung  taiwan and a siliconix leased facility in shanghai  china 
additionally  we subcontract assembly and testing through an affiliate of vishay in israel  as well as independent subcontractors in the philippines  taiwan  china  thailand and korea 
vishay intertechnology  inc vishay owns an interest in siliconix 
vishay  a fortune  company listed on the new york stock exchange  is one of the world s largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors diodes  rectifiers  transistors  optoelectronics  and selected ics and passive electronic components resistors  capacitors  inductors  and transducers 
vishay s components can be found in products manufactured in a very broad range of industries worldwide 
vishay is headquartered in malvern  pennsylvania  and has plants in seventeen countries employing approximately  people 
we maintain various agreements  transactions and relationships with vishay 
our products are sold by the vishay worldwide sales organizations 
effective from january  vishay americas inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of vishay  assumed responsibility for collecting our accounts receivable for the north america region 
other relationships with vishay include administrative service sharing agreements  centralized payment services  a short term loan agreement  and management fees for services provided by the vishay corporate office 
all agreements and relationships with vishay are reviewed and approved by the siliconix board of directors 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share  a decrease of from the million  or per share  achieved in net sales in were million  a increase from net sales of million in business growth became more sustainable in the second half of  and we reached our maximum production level in the third quarter 
we have been expanding our in house manufacturing capacity and plan to more than double our capital expenditures in to satisfy the additional customer demand and the short lead time requests  we substantially increased our activities with subcontractors in the gross margin was impacted as a result of these short term actions as we positioned ourselves for continued growth in for  the gross margin was  compared to for  as cost reductions and materials savings in could not fully compensate for price declines and additional subcontracting expenses 
financial metrics we analyze several financial measures and metrics to evaluate the performance and predict the future direction of our business 
these key financial measures and metrics include sales  backlog  and book to bill ratio 
we also evaluate changes in average selling prices  as compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year and the sequentially preceding quarter 
end of period backlog is one indicator of future sales 
our backlog at december  was at its highest level since the fourth quarter of however  if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the following year 
another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book to bill ratio  which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period 
a book to bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our orders are building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods 
conversely  a book to bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining sales 
the quarter to quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business 
the following table shows sales  the end of period backlog and the book to bill ratio for our business during the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of and through the fourth quarter of th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter sales      end of period backlog      book to bill ratio management believes that these trends are an encouraging indication of broad based demand into  which encompasses all of our major markets and all geographic areas 
the increased product demand has created longer lead times for manufacturing  but customers continue to request short term delivery 
most of our product lines are at full capacity utilization 
we are taking the necessary steps to increase our capacity to accommodate the increased demand 
our manufacturing strategy is to be able to supply about of the customer demand from the internal capacity  and to rely on foundries and subcontractors to meet the other of the business 
this strategy enables us to deal effectively with the fluctuating cycles of the semiconductor industry 
pricing in our industry is volatile 
during  we realized significant price declines  particularly in the first half of the year 
prices stabilized in the second half of the year 
we expect relatively stable pricing trends to continue into critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
we have agreements with distributors that historically provided limited rights of product return 
beginning in  we modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products  which we term a scrap allowance 
consistent with industry practice  we also have a stock  ship and debit program whereby we consider  and grant in our discretion  requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory  to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing 
in addition  we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by us after product is sold by us to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor 
we record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period 
we make our estimates based upon sales levels to our distributors during the period  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the programs  open requests for credits under the programs and recent changes in program policies 
we determine reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments  but we believe they enable us to estimate reasonably future credits for returns and price adjustments 
accounts receivable our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
we also must estimate product returns  scrap allowances  stock  ship and debit credits and price protection credits which our distributors may claim 
as discussed above  we establish allowances against accounts receivable for amounts which we will credit to our distributors based on these incentive programs 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in first out method and market based upon our estimates of net realizable value 
our valuation of inventories also requires us to estimate the amounts of current inventory that will be sold 
these estimates are dependent on management s assessment of current and expected orders from our customers 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the projected cash flows from the asset discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets held for sale  other than goodwill  are determined in a similar manner  except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for were million compared to million for this increase is attributable to a volume improvement of versus  offset by decreases in prices 
pricing pressure was particularly prevalent in the first half of the year 
the outbreak of sars in asia was also a significant factor in the decrease of net sales for the first half of  as our sales into asia comprise approximately of our total sales 
we experienced a rebound in the second half of the year  with volumes strong across all product lines 
the business recovery came primarily from asia  and was particularly driven by demand for computer components and by distributors restocking inventories 
with the favorable shift in the economic and business environments  prices stabilized in the second half of the year 
we deduct  from the sales that we record to distributors  allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns  scrapped product and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors 
we make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made  although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods 
we estimate the deductions based on sales levels during the period  inventory at our distributors  general business  economic  competitive and pricing conditions  and the terms of and our experience with the various incentive programs 
we recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended december  and  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in incentive program activity since is attributable primarily to the adverse business climate that developed following and the resulting pricing pressures affecting our distributors and the semiconductor industry generally 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales in was compared to in the lower gross margin for reflected the effects of price declines and changing product mix as we secured incremental business in the lower gross margin commodity products 
additionally  to respond to the demand increase in and to protect customer satisfaction we substantially increased our engagement with subcontractors to satisfy the short lead time requests 
subcontractor fees paid to independent foundries in and were million and million  respectively 
subcontractor fees paid to independent subcontractors for assembly and testing in and were million and million  respectively 
subcontractor fees paid to vishay in and were approximately million and million  respectively 
we concurrently are investing in expanding our in house capabilities 
our successful cost reduction programs helped to mitigate the impact of these factors 
as demand has shown a sharp increase in the second half of the year  price degradation should be reduced and prices should remain relatively firm in the near future 
research and development research and development expenses were million in compared to million in we continued our funding for new technology developments and new product introductions 
during the  we introduced new products and secured  design wins worldwide 
we have not reduced our funding for new technology developments and new product introductions  though we have realized cost savings in other aspects of our research and development programs 
we have dedicated significant resources to our environmentally friendly lead free conversion program and now offer over  devices in this product line 
we believe that our focus on developing the best solutions for customers through innovation will continue to enhance our leadership in key markets 
selling  marketing  and administration selling  marketing  and administration expenses were million in compared to million in our selling  marketing  and administration expenses as a percentage of net sales in were compared to for the increase in selling  marketing  and administration expenses in was largely due to increases in spending for directors and officers liability insurance  and legal fees incurred in connection with our efforts to maximize the benefits from our patent portfolio 
interest income interest income in was million compared to million in the the decrease in interest income in was due to lower interest rates as compared to all excess cash not immediately needed to fund our operations is invested in money market funds 
other expense income other expense was million in compared to other income of million in other income in includes million received from the chinese government as an incentive for being a foreign partner in china 
income tax expense income tax expense in was million compared to million in our effective tax rate was in  the same as in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for were million compared to million in a significant factor in the increase of from the prior year was a shift from single function cellular phones to feature rich phones with multiple functions ie digital camera  internet  email  ie this trend works to our advantage  as more of our components are required for these more complex telephones 
the improvement in market conditions  which began in the fourth quarter of and continued into the second quarter of  slowed in the third and fourth quarter of during  increase in demand contributed to our sales growth  however  we continued to experience a reduction in the average selling price from caused by the slow economy 
the allowances for price adjustments  returned parts and distributor adjustments as a percentage of net sales were and in and  respectively 
distributors utilized their maximum scrap allowance during gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in an improved product mix  continuing cost reduction programs and more efficient capacity utilization mitigated ongoing pricing pressures 
during  our capacity utilization improved considerably compared to in an effort to improve our operating results  we have focused aggressively on the development of new products that tend to have higher margins 
the sales of products with above average margins increased by in compared to research and development research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in  a increase as a result of our effort and focus on developing new products and technologies 
our research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses in as a percentage of net sales reflected our continuing efforts to balance our plans for new product introductions against the need to reduce overhead in the current challenging business environment 
we believe that it is critical to continue making investments in research and development to ensure the availability of innovative technology that meets both current and future requirements of our customers 
new product introductions remain critical to our success 
we introduced new products in selling  marketing  and administration selling  marketing and administration expenses were million in compared to million in our selling  marketing and administration expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in and  respectively 
the decrease of selling  marketing and administration expenses in compared to was primarily due to our cost control programs 
amortization of goodwill amortization of goodwill in and was and  respectively 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in january accordingly  goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life is no longer amortized but subject to an annual impairment test 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over years 
as of december   accumulated goodwill amortization was million and the net book value of goodwill was million 
as a result of not amortizing goodwill in  operating income increased by  during  we performed an impairment test of the goodwill and determined no impairment related to goodwill 
interest income interest income for the year was million as compared to million in the decrease of interest income in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates 
the average interest rate earned by us declined to in as compared to in during december  we invested million of excess cash with vishay to provide us with short term interest income at a higher interest rate 
the investment with vishay had an interest rate of and was callable by us at any time 
this rate compared favorably to other investment vehicles that offered similar terms and conditions 
all other excess cash not immediately needed to fund our operations is invested in money market funds 
on january   vishay repaid the million to us 
other expense income other expense income was million of income for the year ended december  compared to million of expense in the increase in other income in as compared to was primarily due to foreign exchange gains on our assets denominated in european and asian currencies 
we received million and million in and  respectively  from the chinese government as an incentive for being a foreign partner in china through simconix  our owned subsidiary 
income tax expense income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in  primarily due to the increase in earnings before tax 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the reduced tax rate for was primarily due to a reduction in interest income that was subject to tax at a higher rate 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term note receivable from affiliate as of december  the increase was primarily due to cash generated from operations and an increase in the payable balance to affiliates 
approximately million of the cash balance as of december  was mostly invested in foreign money market accounts 
our cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
any repatriation of earnings and cash back to the united states would be deemed to be a dividend and would be subject to us income taxes  state income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes 
our financial condition at december   continues to be strong  with a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of to  compared with a ratio of to at december  the current ratio has declined since the prior year due primarily to timing related increases in accounts payable both to third parties and to affiliates 
our ratio of liabilities to total assets was to at december   compared to a ratio of to at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in was due primarily to timing related increases in accounts payable both to third parties and to affiliates 
net affiliate payables as of december  increased million from december   mainly due to the timing of cash payments made to unconsolidated affiliates 
accounts payable as of december  increased million from december   which includes approximately million related to capital expenditures  mainly due to the timing of payments to vendors 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to cash used in investing activities of million in cash flows related to investing activities are impacted by our short term loan agreement with vishay under which  we may  from time to time  advance money to vishay 
all notes under this loan agreement are callable by us at any time 
interest income related to these loans is included in cash flows from operating activities 
for the year ended december   we had a net outflow of million for short term investments pursuant to this agreement 
for the year ended december   we had a net inflow of million for short term investments pursuant to this agreement 
since july   there have been no amounts outstanding related to this agreement 
purchases of property  plant  and equipment were approximately million in  of which million is included in accounts payable at december  and is thus excluded from the statement of cash flows 
we continue to invest in expanding our in house manufacturing capabilities to meet increasing demand 
for the next twelve months  management expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements and to fund our research and development and capital expenditure plans 
contractual commitments as of december   we had contractual obligations in the form of non cancelable operating leases 
these are described in further detail in note leases and commitments 
payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands operating leases    total contractual cash obligations    in  in order to secure additional manufacturing capacity  we  through an affiliate  entered into an agreement with fraunhofer gesellschaft fhg  an institute partially owned by the german government  for the use of the fhg wafer fabrication facility in itzehoe  germany until december  this affiliate was acquired by vishay concurrent with vishay s acquisition of its interest in siliconix in under this agreement  we are committed to pay for certain operating costs at the itzehoe facility  regardless of the extent of actual manufacturing output  through the expiration of the agreement 
in  operating expenses at this location for which we were responsible under the agreement were approximately million 
subsequently  through december   we have not been required to make any additional payment to support fhg s operating expenses 
on december   we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with tower semiconductor for a long term manufacturing and supply arrangement between the parties 
pursuant to the terms of the memorandum of understanding  we plan to place with tower orders valued at approximately million for the purchase of semiconductor wafers to be manufactured in tower s fab over a seven to ten year period  of which approximately million would be guaranteed and would be delivered over the three year period starting at the first anniversary of the definitive agreement 
we plan to advance to tower million to be used for the purchase of additional equipment required to satisfy siliconix s orders  which would be credited towards the purchase price of the wafers 
the transaction is subject to the approval of both companies boards of directors  tower s lending bank and the israeli investment center and to the negotiation of definitive documentation 
while there can be no assurances that a definitive agreement will be reached  we expect a definitive agreement to be signed during the first half of if a definitive agreement is not reached  we will have no commitments related to this memorandum of understanding 
we do not have any long term debt  nor do we guarantee any of vishay s debt 
through december   we have not been a party to any of vishay s debt 
foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december  and  there were no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
related party transactions we maintain various agreements  transactions and relationships with vishay 
all agreements and relationships with vishay are reviewed and approved by the siliconix board of directors 
sales organizations our products are sold by the vishay worldwide sales organizations that operate as three regionally based legal entities 
the three regions consist of north america  europe  and asia 
the aim of the vishay sales structure is to unify the activities of the member companies  provide efficiencies by eliminating the duplications of many functions  and bring greater value to end customers by allowing them to deal with one entity for their active and passive electronic component purchasing needs 
vishay sales organizations function as our undisclosed agents  through commission arrangements at a fixed percentage of sales made in each region for all sales related functions  however  the ownership of all sales  receivable  inventory  and risk of loss remains with siliconix  with the exception of the north america region 
effective from january  vishay americas inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of vishay  assumed responsibility for collecting our accounts receivable for the north america region 
accounts receivable ownership for the north america region sales is transferred to vishay americas inc at the gross amount as soon as sales invoices are generated 
vishay americas inc is compensated for accounts receivable collection  credit risk analysis  bad debt exposure  and selling expenses through a commission arrangement at a fixed percentage of sales 
accounts receivable transferred to vishay americas inc were million and million in and  respectively 
commissions paid to vishay affiliates for north america  europe  and asia pacific sales and related activities were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
these commission amounts  averaging less than of sales  are included in selling  marketing  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
increases in commissions paid to vishay are attributable to increased sales  and in  an increase of in the rate paid related to sales and related activities for the north america region 
subcontract manufacturing in  in order to secure additional manufacturing capacity  we  through an affiliate  entered into an agreement with fraunhofer gesellschaft fhg  an institute partially owned by the german government  for the use of the fhg wafer fabrication facility in itzehoe  germany until december  this affiliate was acquired by vishay concurrent with vishay s acquisition of its interest in siliconix in during   and  fhg provided wafer fabrication subcontract services to us 
subcontractor fees were million  million  and million  respectively 
subcontractor fees are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income 
the increase in these subcontractor fees between and is attributable to costs incurred to meet the high demand experienced for our products  particularly in the second half of the year 
according to the agreement entered into in by us  through an affiliate  we agreed to pay for certain operating costs at the fhg facility  regardless of the extent of actual manufacturing output  until december  for the years ended december    and  we have not been required to make and have not made any payment to support fhg s operating expenses 
beginning in  a wholly owned subsidiary of vishay in israel was engaged to provide assembly and testing subcontract services for us 
subcontractor fees paid were million in  million in  and million in subcontractor fees are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income 
the increase in these subcontractor fees between and is attributable to costs incurred to meet the high demand experienced for our products  particularly in the second half of the year 
administrative service sharing agreements we have certain service sharing agreements with vishay and certain of its affiliates 
administrative expenses primarily relate to personnel  insurance  logistics  other overhead functions  corporate it support  and network communications support are shared and then allocated to the appropriate party on a periodic basis 
during   and related parties reimbursed siliconix million  million  and million  respectively  for administrative expenses incurred by siliconix on their behalf 
during the same periods  siliconix reimbursed related parties million  million  and million  respectively  for administrative expenses incurred by related parties on our behalf 
these administrative reimbursements and payments are included in selling  marketing  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
these reimbursements in include increases in various costs  particularly insurance  and  to a lesser extent  procurement and marketing 
centralized payment services vishay maintains a centralized payment system for asian accounts payable 
in  vishay created a centralized payment system for us accounts payable and us payroll 
we reimburse actual amounts paid by vishay 
amounts reimbursed by siliconix were million and million for asian accounts payable in and amounts reimbursed by siliconix were million for us accounts payable and million for us payroll in additionally  in  siliconix reimbursed million of third party warehouse costs paid by vishay on our behalf 
in prior years  these amounts were billed directly to siliconix by the third party warehouse 
management fees we pay management fees to vishay  primarily related to services provided by the vishay corporate office  including accounting matters for all sec filings  investor relations  tax services  cash management  legal services  and the handling of insurance coverage on a global basis 
management fees paid by siliconix to vishay were million  million  and million during   and respectively 
sales to affiliates of vishay product sales to vishay and its affiliates were million  million and million during   and  respectively 
these amounts are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income

as of december   the entire related party promissory note was outstanding 
this promissory note was fully repaid on january  in march  we received a related party promissory note under the loan agreement for million  which was callable by us at any time and bore an interest rate of 
this promissory note was fully repaid on april  in june  we received a related party promissory note under the loan agreement for million  which was callable by us at any time and bore an interest rate of 
this promissory note was fully repaid on july  there have been no related party promissory notes outstanding since july  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
were adopted for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  there were no such activities initiated during the year ended december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no

  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
the interpretation requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that obligation 
this interpretation is intended to improve the comparability of financial reporting by requiring identical accounting for guarantees issued with separately identified consideration and guarantees issued without separately identified consideration 
the recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  the future impact will depend upon whether siliconix enters into or modifies any material guarantee arrangements 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb the primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise the primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either i the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the effective dates and impact of fin and fin r are as follows i special purpose entities spes created prior to february  we must apply either the provisions of fin or early adopt the provisions of fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  ii non spes created prior to february  we are required to adopt fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  iii all entities  regardless of whether an spe  that were created subsequent to january  the provisions of fin were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after january  the adoption of the provisions applicable to spes and all other variable interests obtained after january  did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity

majority shareholder vishay owns an interest in siliconix 
we maintain various agreements  transactions and relationships with vishay 
while management believes that these agreements  transactions and relationships provide administrative and operating efficiencies  the existence of these arrangements limits our autonomy 
technological change and competition the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions  and declining average selling prices over product life cycles 
our future success is highly dependent upon the timely completion and introduction of new products and technologies at competitive prices and performance levels  and upon having those products selected for design into products of leading manufacturers 
in addition  we must respond to competitors in our markets 
if we are not able to make timely introduction of new products and technologies  or to respond effectively to competition  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
variable demand the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has been subject to significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand 
a material portion of our revenues has recently been derived from the worldwide communication and computer markets 
these markets have historically been somewhat volatile  as demand for the end products in these markets has varied widely from time to time 
if demand for these end products should decrease significantly  the producers thereof could reduce their purchase of our products that in turn could have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
conversely  during periods of a rising economy  we may experience intense demand for our products 
during such periods  we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand 
factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment  shortages of skilled personnel and capacity constraints at our facilities 
if we are unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production  we could lose customers and or market share 
this loss could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
political and economic considerations in recent years  a large and increasing portion of our net sales  operating profits  manufacturing production  and growth has come from our international operations 
as a result  our business activities and financial results could be significantly affected by the policies of foreign governments and prevailing political  social  and economic conditions 
dependence on key suppliers we use numerous suppliers to supply raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that materials are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always possible 
accordingly  certain key materials are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these suppliers are  in some cases  thinly capitalized  independent companies that generate significant portions of their business from us and or a small group of other companies in the semiconductor industry 
we have sought and will continue to seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and or shortages of key materials by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key materials  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers  and maintaining appropriate inventories of key materials 
there can be no assurance that our results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if  in the future  we do not receive sufficient materials to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
intellectual property matters the semiconductor industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing patent and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others 
further  we have observed that in the current semiconductor industry business environment  companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors 
while we continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement  or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
interest and currency rate exposure in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risks associated with interest rate movements  currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  and collectibility of accounts receivable

earthquakes our principal manufacturing facility and executive offices are located in santa clara  california 
a number of earthquakes have occurred in this region  some of them severe 
no material retrofitting is required to bring the buildings comprising the santa clara facility into compliance with current applicable seismic codes 
no assurance can be given  however  that in the event of a major earthquake  the resulting damage would not materially impact or even interrupt our production  either of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
severe acute respiratory syndrome the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  that began in the people s republic of china adversely affected our business during the first six months of  particularly in asia where we derived approximately of our revenue in and this impact included disruptions in the operations of our customers  a slowdown in customer orders and reduced sales in certain end markets
