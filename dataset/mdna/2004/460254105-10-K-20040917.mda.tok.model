item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal impairment of assets  restructuring and severance charges 
in july subsequent to fiscal year end  we completed the acquisition of the specialty silicon epitaxial services assets from advanced technology materials  inc for approximately million in cash  which may be reduced by million  pending the qualification of certain processes as part of the transaction 
we expect this acquisition to lower our production costs and provide certain key intellectual property for epitaxial silicon substrates manufacturing see note  acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements 
products and applications our products process electrical power into a form that is more readily usable by electric products 
we believe that our full complement of power management technology represents a competitive advantage  enabling us to provide customers with solutions that shorten their overall product development cycle time 
our products are broadly divided among three product categories analog ics and advanced circuit devices  power systems and power components 
analog ics and advanced circuit devices an analog ic is a semiconductor that integrates logic and power management functions on the same chip 
these devices optimize the performance of circuits that often include power mosfets and igbts and allow our customers to simplify circuit design and assembly  improve reliability  and reduce overall system size and cost 
the ability of an analog ic to sense and respond to circuit conditions makes its performance superior to discrete components 
our ics often use our proprietary power mosfet technology 
we have obtained substantial patent protection for our ics and have additional patent applications pending 
advanced circuit devices are chipsets  multichip modules and other advanced performance devices that address power management requirements in demanding applications 
these products are value added or are provided under reduced competition due to their technological content or our customer relationship 
increased complexity in computers  routers  servers and other devices require increased levels of power and more effective heat dissipation  making power management one of the most critical tasks 
it applications are trending to lower voltages and higher current levels  which require greater efficiency and more complex power management to meet speed and performance demands 
advanced consumer electronics such as pdp televisions and game consoles also require more efficient and complex power management 
we continue to invest aggressively in analog ic technology and key trench  planar and other process technologies 
these investments have resulted in what we believe are the most efficient analog ics and advance circuit devices 
among other attributes  we believe these product offerings set the industry standard for performance and cost efficiency in high volume consumer electronics applications 
power systems power systems combine power semiconductors with other power management components in specialized modules that improve power efficiency and simplify circuit design 
we focus our power systems on automotive electronics and motor control 
our products provide a cost effective alternative to custom analog designs 
the proliferation of power features in automobiles and tougher standards for safety  fuel economy and emissions  are driving the adoption of more complex power electronics 
our power systems can help reconcile conflicting demands for more power features and better fuel mileage by replacing traditional hydraulic and belt driven applications with electronic systems 
in addition  electrically operated automotive systems improve reliability and maintenance 
our power systems are designed into integrated starter alternator motors  electronic power steering systems  fuel and water pumps and fan controls 
motors consume approximately half of the world s electricity 
new variable speed motors equipped with power systems increase energy efficiency and performance in a wide range of household  commercial and industrial applications 
for example  most refrigerator motors can operate only at full speed  but a variable speed motor can run at the lowest speed needed to maintain the required temperature 
our power systems designed for variable speed motors reduce electricity consumption  simplify product design  improve product performance and reduce overall costs 
also  we have achieved multiple sole source design wins from leading worldwide manufacturers in high end washers  refrigerators and other energy efficient appliances 
in fiscal  we entered into a joint venture agreement with the semiconductor division of sanyo electric company 
the joint venture  named ir sa integrated technologies co  is focused on electronic motion control solutions in the appliance and light industrial markets 
the joint venture brings together our mixed signal ic and discrete expertise and sanyo s packaging expertise to pursue those markets 
power components switching products 
power mosfets and igbts rapidly and efficiently switch electricity on and off in order to supply power in a form that can be formatted to the specific requirements of a circuit 
through our hexfet product line  we believe that we are the market leader in power mosfets 
our emphasis on quality control and reliability has helped us maintain market acceptance and brand recognition of our hexfet line of products 
we pioneered the fundamental planar technology that set the industry standard for power mosfets 
mosfets are critical in a wide variety of electric products 
communications applications include cellular phones  telephone networks and modems 
computer and peripheral applications include power supplies  disk drives and printers 
office equipment applications include copiers and facsimile machines 
consumer electronics applications include home entertainment  video cameras  household appliances and power tools 
automobile applications include anti lock braking systems  fuel injection systems  power accessories and air bags 
industrial applications include automated production equipment  instrumentation and test equipment 
defense aerospace applications include communications satellites and satellite command and control systems 
igbts typically perform the switch function in industrial applications that require higher current and voltage than power mosfets can handle efficiently 
the performance and ruggedness of these devices enable them to replace bipolar transistors and thyristors in many high voltage  high current motor control and power conditioning applications 
energy efficient  variable speed motor controls are an emerging application  and we believe hybrid and electric vehicles may require large quantities of igbts for each vehicle 
our igbt technology is closely related to our power mosfet technology 
we believe that our patents on fundamental power mosfet technology also apply to igbts 
rectifiers  diodes and thyristors 
we manufacture a broad line of rectifiers  diodes and thyristors 
these products  which also condition electrical power to make it more efficient and usable  are used in industrial end products that require power handling capability from one amp to  amps and from volts to  volts 
applications include motor and lighting controls  welding equipment  forklifts  machine tools  induction heating  locomotives  motor driven production lines  smelting equipment and power supplies 
our schottky diodes and fast recovery diodes serve the output rectification function of power conversion 
a diode is a discrete device that conducts current in one direction 
a schottky diode is an ultra fast diode used in high frequency  low voltage circuits 
a fast recovery diode is a diode suited to applications above volts where high switching speed is desirable 
schottky diodes are used with power mosfets in high frequency applications such as computers and peripherals 
our hexfred fast recovery diodes are used with igbts in higher current  lower frequency applications such as motor controls 
manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing involves two phases of production wafer fabrication and assembly 
wafer fabrication requires a sequence of process steps that expose silicon wafers to chemicals that change their electrical properties 
the chemicals are applied in patterns that define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices  termed die or chips  on each wafer 
assembly is the sequence of production steps that divide the wafer into individual chips and enclose the chips in structures  termed packages  that make them usable in a circuit 
power semiconductors generally use process technology and equipment already proven in the manufacturing of integrated circuits 
we have manufacturing and or assembly facilities in california  massachusetts  mexico  the united kingdom  germany  italy  india and china 
in addition  we have equipment at  or manufacturing supply agreements with  subcontractors located in the philippines  thailand  taiwan  malaysia  the czech republic  germany and the united states 
our most advanced wafer fabrication facility  located in newport  wales  provides wafer fabrication capacity for mixed signal and analog processes 
we have a mosfet wafer fabrication facility in temecula  california  and a high voltage analog ic wafer fabrication facility in el segundo  california 
assembly operations for products used in defense aerospace applications are located in leominster  massachusetts and santa clara  california 
we are transitioning certain assembly of government and space products to tijuana  mexico as part of our restructuring activities see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we manufacture substantially all of our schottky diodes  high power rectifiers and thyristors at our turin  italy facility 
plants that assemble power mosfets and other products are located overseas in facilities we own or in subcontracted facilities 
our high volume assembly lines for power mosfets  igbts and diodes are located in our facility in tijuana  mexico 
we use production facilities in swansea  wales and krefeld  germany to manufacture and assemble automotive power systems 
also as part of our restructuring activities  we are moving most manufacturing activities at krefeld  germany to swansea  wales and tijuana  mexico facilities  and expect the move to be completed by fiscal second quarter see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in a duty free zone in india  we have an assembly facility for rectifiers and thyristors 
in july  subsequent to fiscal  we acquired the specialty silicon epitaxial services assets from advanced technology materials  inc this new manufacturing facility is located in mesa  arizona 
marketing  sales and distribution we market our products through direct sales staff  representatives and distributors 
in line with this strategy  we are adding a complement of field application engineers and technical sales support staff to better serve the needs of our customers for ir s proprietary products 
for the fiscal year ended june   direct sales to original equipment manufacturers oem s and our distributors accounted for percent and percent  respectively  of product sales 
for the fiscal year ended june   direct sales to oems and our distributors accounted for percent and percent  respectively  of product sales 
for the fiscal year ended june   direct sales to oems and our distributors accounted for percent and percent  respectively  of product sales 
in fiscal  our product sales by region  based on the location of the customer  were approximately percent from north america  percent from europe and percent from asia  which includes japan and asia pacific 
our domestic direct sales force is organized into five regional sales zones 
in europe  our products are sold through our own sales force as well as through independent sales agents and distributors 
our european sales and representative offices are in the united kingdom  sweden  finland  denmark  spain  france  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  russia  the czech republic and hungary 
in asia  we have sales representative or liaison offices in india  japan  singapore  china  hong kong  south korea  taiwan and the philippines 
we also have sales representative or liaison offices in mexico  australia and new zealand 
for financial information about the results for our geographic areas for each of the last three fiscal years  refer to notes to the consolidated financial statements note  geographic information and foreign operations 
because many applications require products from several product groups  we have organized our product development and marketing efforts by sector and application  rather than product type 
in addition  our staff of application engineers provides customers with technical advice and support regarding the use of our products 
we have increased the number of engineering offices to help support our proprietary products 
we believe the depth of our power management product line enhances our competitive position in the overall power semiconductor market 
customers our devices are incorporated in subsystems and end products manufactured by other companies 
no single oem customer  distributor or contract manufacturers accounted for more than ten percent of our revenue for the fiscal year ended june  the following table lists some of our major customers by end market for fiscal customers end markets information technology communications alcatel  astec  artesyn technologies  cisco  delta  lucent  motorola  nortel and power one information technology computing apple  dell  fujitsu  hpq  ibm  intel  nec and sony automotive bosch  daimler chrysler  delphi  nagares  siemensvdo  temic  trw  valeo and visteon consumer electronics fujitsu  matsushita  maytag  miele  philips  samsung  sanyo and sony defense aerospace bae  boeing  honeywell  lockheed martin  northrop grumman  raytheon and tyco industrial advanced energy  american power conversion  danfoss  ela medical  emerson  itw  lincoln  schneider and zapi distributors and contract manufacturers based on revenues for fiscal distributors arrow electronics  avnet  future electronics  lintek  weikeng and zenitron contract manufacturers celestica  flextronics  jabil  sanmina sci and solectron backlog as of june   our backlog of orders was million compared to million as of june  backlog is comprised of purchase orders and customer forecast commitments scheduled to be shipped within the following twelve months 
increasingly  major customers are operating their businesses with shorter lead times and are placing their orders at shorter intervals  which tend to reduce backlog relative to future revenue 
the increase in backlog at june  is largely attributable to the success with our proprietary products and the upturn in the semiconductor industry 
given adequate notice  we usually allow customers to cancel purchase orders without penalty 
the amount of backlog to be shipped during any period is dependent on various factors and can vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
research and development we conduct research and development activities to improve the performance and cost effectiveness of our product offerings in target applications 
our research and development program focuses on analog ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems and the advancement and diversification of our hexfet power mosfet and igbt product lines 
we also direct our research and development toward reducing our customers time to market and reducing the cost of their products 
our program places increasing emphasis on the development of chipsets and system level solutions that improve overall system performance and cost  and helps customers to accelerate market introduction of their products 
in fiscal  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
our design centers are located throughout the world  including the united states  canada  the united kingdom  denmark  italy  france  germany and singapore 
during fiscal  we achieved performance enhancements and cost reductions across our product line 
a few of the more notable product introductions for fiscal included a new additions to the ipowir family of products that provide the industry s first dual output  two phase power building blocks for dc dc converters inside advanced telecom  networking and server systems b a broad expansion of our family of directfet power mosfets which tackle the thermal limitations associated with high end microprocessors c new lighting ics that set new standards in innovation in energy efficient lighting applications d a growing complement of imotion motor control products that now include a collection of driver ics and power stage modules  aimed at improving energy efficiency in appliance and industrial applications  e a new driver ic for class d audio amplifiers  and f a new integrated motor control ic for automotive applications 
intellectual property we continue to make significant investments in developing and protecting our intellectual property 
we have increased our research and development spending percent over the last five years  a period that included the steepest downturn in the history of the semiconductor industry 
we have issued unexpired us patents and us patent applications pending including provisional applications 
our power mosfet patents expire between and  with the broadest remaining in effect until and in addition  we have issued foreign patents and foreign patent applications pending in a number of countries including applications filed under treaty 
we are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others 
we have several registered trademarks in the united states and abroad  including the trademark hexfet 
we believe that our intellectual property contributes to our competitive advantage 
we are committed to enforcing our patent rights  including through litigation  if necessary 
through successful enforcement of our patents  we have entered into more than license agreements  generated royalty income  and received substantial payments in settlement of litigation 
consistent with this policy  we have settled patent infringement suits against hitachi ltd 
and affiliated companies in march  see note  litigation 
our broadest power mosfet patents were subject to  and have successfully emerged from  reexamination by the united states patent and trademark office 
we currently have license agreements with the majority of power mosfet manufacturers in the united states and abroad 
in fiscal  and  we derived million  million and million of royalty revenues from license agreements  respectively 
our royalty income stream is dependent on the continued enforceability and validity of our patents  the ability of our competitors to design around our mosfet technology or develop competing technologies  and general market conditions 
the continuation of such royalties is subject to a number of risks see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition factors that may affect future results our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to risks 
competition we encounter differing degrees of competition for our various products  depending upon the nature of the product and the particular market served 
generally  the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid price changes and product design changes 
several of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources 
we believe that we are distinguished from our competitors by our comprehensive line of power management products and ability to combine these products into compact  cost effective packages and system level solutions 
our products compete with products manufactured by others on the basis of enabling capability  performance  reliability  quality  price  delivery time to customer and service including technical advice and support 
our major competitors in analog ics and advanced circuit devices include analog devices  intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  semtech and texas instruments 
our major competitors in power components include fairchild semiconductor  hitachi  infineon technologies  mitsubishi  nec  on semiconductor  phillips  stmicroelectronics  toshiba and vishay siliconix 
aside from typical industry competitors  our power systems products often offer our customers an improved alternative to manufacturing systems internally 
environmental matters federal  state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the storage  use and discharge of certain materials  chemicals  and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes 
we do not believe that compliance with such laws and regulations as now in effect will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  under some of these laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if properties are contaminated or if waste is sent to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
we cannot make assurances that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment and the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as could any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
ir and rachelle laboratories  inc rachelle  a former operating subsidiary of ours that discontinued operations in  were each named a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the investigation by the united states environmental protection agency epa of the disposal of allegedly hazardous substances at a major superfund site in monterey park  california oii site 
certain prps who settled certain claims with the epa under consent decrees filed suit in federal court in may against a number of other prps  including us  for cost recovery and contribution under the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
ir has settled all outstanding claims that have arisen against it out of the oii site 
no claims against rachelle have been settled 
the company has taken the position that none of the wastes generated by rachelle were hazardous 
counsel for rachelle received another letter  dated august  from the us department of justice  directed to all or substantially all prps for the oii site  offering to settle claims against such parties for all work performed through and including the final remedy for the oii site 
the offer required a payment from rachelle in the amount of approximately million in order to take advantage of the settlement 
rachelle did not accept the offer 
in as much as rachelle has not accepted the settlement  we cannot predict whether the epa or others would attempt to assert an action for contribution or reimbursement for monies expended to perform remedial actions at the oii site 
we cannot predict the likelihood that the epa or such others would prevail against rachelle in any such action 
we maintain the position of rachelle that its wastes were not hazardous 
our insurer has not accepted liability  although it has made payments for defense costs for the lawsuit against us 
we have made no accrual for potential loss  if any  however  an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our cash flows 
we received a letter in june from a law firm representing udt sensors  inc relating to environmental contamination chlorinated solvents such as trichlorethene assertedly found in udt s properties in hawthorne  california 
the letter alleges that we operated a manufacturing business at that location in the s and or s and that we may have liability in connection with the claimed contamination 
we have made no accrual for any potential losses since there has been no assertion of specific facts on which to form the basis for determination of liability 
employees as of june   we employed approximately  people  of whom approximately  were employed in north america   in europe and in asia pacific and japan

item legal proceedings in june  we filed suit in federal district court in los angeles  california  against ixys corporation  alleging infringement of our key us patents   and  the suit sought damages and other relief customary in such matters 
in august  ixys filed an answer and counterclaim  and in february  amended its answer and counterclaim  denying infringement and alleging patent invalidity and unenforceability 
the federal district court entered a permanent injunction  effective on june   barring ixys and all persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the injunction from making  using  offering to sell or selling in  or importing into  the united states  mosfets including igbts covered by ir s us patents   and or  in august  the court of appeals for the federal circuit stayed that injunction  pending appeal on the merits 
in the federal district court  in august  following trial on damages issues  the jury awarded us million in compensatory damages 
the federal district court subsequently trebled the damages  increasing the award from million to approximately million  and ruled that the company is entitled to an additional award of reasonable attorney s fees for a total monetary judgment of million 
in march  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the summary judgment granted us by the federal district court in los angeles of infringement by ixys of the company s us patents   and  the case was remanded for further proceedings and reexamination of a number of issues before the los angeles district court where it originated 
the federal circuit reversed in part and vacated in part infringement findings of the district court  granted ixys the right to present certain affirmative defenses  and vacated the injunction against ixys entered by the district court 
the ruling by the federal circuit will also have the effect of vacating the damages judgment obtained against ixys 
the federal circuit affirmed the district court s rulings in the company s favor regarding the validity and enforceability of the three company patents 
upon remand  the company plans to continue to vigorously pursue its claims for damages and other relief based on ixys infringement of the asserted patents 
additionally in a related case  in july  the district court awarded the company sanctions against samsung semiconductor  inc  in an amount including attorney s fees of about million  subject to certain credits of up to million 
in march  the court of appeals for the federal circuit determined that samsung did not violate the injunction  vacating the previous sanctions award 
in january  we filed suit in the federal district court in los angeles  california  against hitachi  ltd 
and affiliated companies alleging infringement of certain of ir s us patents 
we later brought additional claims alleging infringement of certain other of our patents 
hitachi denied infringement and validity of the patents and entered a counterclaim of patent misuse 
during fiscal  we added renesas technology corp renesas and its us affiliate to such suit as additional parties defendant 
renesas is a joint venture comprised of hitachi percent and mitsubishi electric corporation percent 
in january  we entered into a patent cross license agreement with hitachi and renesas 
the agreement also settled the previously pending litigation among the parties 
in the march quarter  we reported a one time pretax gain  net of legal expenses and related costs  of approximately million related to this matter 
the agreement also provides for hitachi and renesas paying an on going royalty on worldwide sales covered by certain of our power mosfet igbt patents 
we will pay an on going royalty to hitachi on our sales in japan of certain power mosfets and to renesas on our sales in japan of certain other products 
the agreement takes effect for payment of ongoing royalties on april  and will continue through the expiration of the applicable licensed patents

company and industry overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of power management products and the leading worldwide supplier of a type of power semiconductor called a mosfet a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor 
power semiconductors process electricity into a form more usable by electrical products 
power semiconductors increase system efficiency  allow more compact end products  improve features and functionality and extend battery life 
our products are used in a range of end markets  including information technology  automotive  consumer electronics  aerospace defense and industrial 
historically  demand for power semiconductors has displayed cyclical characteristics 
within the power semiconductor market  mosfets and other related products known as igbts are important components in power management 
based on statistics published by the semiconductor industry association  a leading semiconductor industry group  industry wide revenues from sales of power mosfets and igbts were billion in calendar and are forecasted to total approximately billion in calendar based on this information and other publicly available surveys  the semiconductor industry appears to be demonstrating signs of recovery from a significant downturn in recent years 
overall economic conditions continue to be somewhat uncertain and difficult to predict 
we believe current demand for our products is driven largely by the following increased speed and functionality in information technology

applications in automotive electronics and motor controls 
in the automotive market  the proliferation of power features and high end electronics and a desire for increased fuel efficiency 
defense aerospace demand for advanced power management technology 
in the defense aerospace industry  power management technology is used to meet rigorous space  weight and reliability requirements 
aerospace systems designers are constantly striving for higher efficiency power conversion solutions and there is a trend in aircraft designs of converting from hydraulic control systems to electronic control systems 
company products strategy our products are broadly divided among three general product categories analog ics and advanced circuit devices  power systems and power components 
see business for a more detailed description of our products 
our products serve a wide range of applications in the information technology  consumer electronics  automotive  defense aerospace and industrial markets 
however  we emphasize targeted applications where we can apply our more advanced and more competitive products 
in doing so  we focus on what we call our proprietary products 
our proprietary products refer to our analog ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems 
we include in our reference to proprietary products those products that are value added or are provided under reduced competition due to their technological content or our customer relationship 
we periodically review products to determine their inclusion as proprietary products so as to help focus our efforts 
in the fiscal year ended june   our proprietary products revenues grew percent over the previous fiscal year s revenues 
we implement our strategy through initiatives that leverage our technology  develop products to meet application specific needs and lower costs 
leverage our leading edge technology and extend our leadership in power components 
our research and development program focuses on our proprietary products and the advancement and diversification of certain of our power mosfet and igbt product lines 
over the three years ended june   we spent million on research and development 
our worldwide patent portfolio consists of issued patents and patent applications pending  of which are provisional applications see business intellectual property 
in fiscal  and  licenses under our patents  primarily our power mosfet patents  generated million  million and million  respectively  in royalties 
our royalty income stream is currently dependent on the continued enforceability and validity of our patents  the ability of our competitors to design around our licensed mosfet technology or develop competing technologies  and general market conditions 
the continuation of such royalties is subject to a number of risks see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition factors that may affect future results our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to risks 
our licensed mosfet patents expire between and  with the broadest remaining in effect until and for technologies other than our licensed mosfet technologies  we are concentrating on incorporating our technologies into proprietary products and exploring licensing opportunities we believe meet our overall business strategies 
capitalize on relationships with market leaders 
many industry leaders look to us for products and programs that address their most challenging power management needs 
these relationships put us at the forefront of developing products for new trends in the marketplace 
we have increased the number of proprietary product sales professionals and field application engineers worldwide  to offer technological design expertise and high quality customer service 
this comprehensive sales and engineering support includes internet service applications  electronic order entry and just in time delivery 
capitalize on low cost manufacturing 
we fabricate most of our chips in facilities designed to address the specific requirements of power semiconductors 
we believe that our wafer fabrication costs are among the lowest in the industry 
we have wafer fabrication and or assembly production facilities in california  massachusetts  mexico  the united kingdom  germany  italy  india and china 
we also use third party foundries and assemblers to supplement our internal manufacturing in a manner to provide capacity flexibility and efficiency 
we purchased the newport  wales facility in fiscal near the bottom of the last market cycle 
one of the two fabrication lines there was idle at the time of acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began recommissioning the idled line and expect first production wafers by july this facility provides our most cost effective and advanced manufacturing capabilities and offers us significant capacity to support our growth over the next several years 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced certain restructuring initiatives 
our goal was to position the company to better fit market conditions  de emphasize our commodity business and accelerate the move to our proprietary products 
the restructuring plan included consolidating and closing several older facilities and legacy operations 
we also plan to lower overhead costs across our support organizations 
we expect these initiatives to be significantly completed by calendar year end december we expect to realize annualized savings of over million by calendar year end from our restructuring activities 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began executing our plan to discontinue and divest business totaling million in annual revenues from certain slow growth  low margin commodity products 
we plan to reallocate certain manufacturing resources to the production of our fast growing  high margin proprietary products 
in july subsequent to year end  we completed the acquisition of the specialty silicon epitaxial services assets from advanced technology materials  inc for approximately million in cash  which may be reduced by million  pending the qualification of certain processes as part of the transaction 
we expect this acquisition to lower our production costs and provide certain key intellectual property for epitaxial silicon substrate manufacturing 
we believe our strategies as outlined above have contributed to our overall margin growth 
our gross margins increased to percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal  from percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal we generated million in cash flow from operations in fiscal compared to million in the prior year period 
our cash  cash equivalents  cash investments in marketable debt securities and unused credit facilities of million  totaled million 
our financial position  in addition to our available credit facilities described below  enables ir to continue to invest for the future 
we continue to invest in both personnel and facilities to support our growth  among other areas  in asia pacific  our largest and fastest growing region  including breaking ground on a new assembly and test facility in x ian  china 
we invested million in capital expenditures primarily related to upgrading wafer manufacturing capabilities and increasing assembly capacity 
additionally at june   we had purchase commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million primarily at our newport  wales facility 
we believe that our current cash and cash investment balances  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity  including unused amounts under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our currently foreseeable operating cash requirements and to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they occur in the next twelve months 
although we believe that our current financial resources will be sufficient for normal operating activities  we may also consider the use of funds from other external sources  including  but not limited to  public or private offerings of debt or equity 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items included in selected financial data as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal years ended june  revenues cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expense research and development expense amortization of acquisition related intangible assets impairment of assets  restructuring  severance and other charges other income expense  net interest income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss fiscal compared with fiscal revenues revenues for fiscal were billion compared to million in fiscal fiscal revenues reflected the growth in sales of what we categorize as our proprietary products and the upturn in the semiconductor industry

royalties contributed million to revenues  compared to million in fiscal revenues from our proprietary products increased by percent compared to the prior fiscal year 
these revenues comprised percent of product revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to percent in the comparable prior year period 
our proprietary products refer to our analog ics  power systems and advanced circuit devices 
in designating proprietary products  we periodically review products to characterize them as value added or as provided under reduced competition due to their technological content or due to customer requirements 
revenues as a percentage of total product revenues were percent  percent and percent for north america  asia and europe  respectively  for the fiscal year ended june  revenues as a percentage of total product revenues were percent  percent and percent for north america  asia and europe  respectively  for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal revenues from sales to original equipment manufacturers oems grew by percent from fiscal  accounting for percent of fiscal product revenues  compared to percent for fiscal we also classify revenues from sales to oems by end market applications 
compared to the prior year  revenues from all end market applications grew 
fiscal performance in end market applications is as follows the information technology sector comprised approximately percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector grew percent from fiscal this increase primarily reflected greater content and market share of our proprietary products for the latest desktops  notebooks and servers and a general upturn in the information technology market 
the automotive sector comprised approximately percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector grew by one percent from fiscal in the december quarter  we were awarded a significant automotive contract for which production on this program is expected to commence in calendar year the consumer sector comprised approximately percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector increased by percent from fiscal  reflecting growth in plasma display panels pdps  liquid crystal displays lcds  digital televisions  recordable digital video discs dvds  digital music players and smart appliances 
the defense aerospace sector comprised approximately percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector grew percent from fiscal  primarily as a result of increase in market share and new programs including advanced aircraft  global positioning satellites and smart weaponry 
the industrial sector comprised approximately seven percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector grew percent from fiscal  reflecting conservative capital equipment spending patterns 
our sales to distributors grew percent from fiscal  and our top fifteen distributors sales of our products to the end customers increased percent over the same period 
gross profit margin for the twelve months ended june  and  gross profit was million and million percent and percent of revenues  respectively 
the gross profit margin improvement reflected the sale of a higher margin mix of proprietary products and manufacturing cost savings  including reduced material costs  increased yield and labor and overhead efficiencies 
gross margin in the prior year ended june   included a million inventory charge to write down raw material and work in process inventories impaired as a result of planned plant closures  which negatively impacted gross margin by percent for that period 
selling and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june   selling and administrative expense was million percent of revenues  compared to million percent of revenues in the twelve months ended june  the decline in the selling and administrative expense ratio primarily reflected a higher revenue base in the current year compared to the prior year and our cost containment efforts 
the absolute selling and administrative expense increase primarily reflected sales commissions and other variable costs paid on a higher revenue base 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended june  and  research and development expense was million and million percent and percent of revenues  respectively 
research and development expenditures increased reflecting continued development focus on our proprietary products 
impairment of assets  restructuring and severance charges during fiscal second quarter ended december   we announced our restructuring initiatives 
under our restructuring initiatives  our goal was to reposition the company to better fit the market conditions  de emphasize the commodity business and accelerate the move to what we categorize as our proprietary products 
our restructuring plan included consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advanced technology platforms or products 
we also planned to lower overhead costs across our support organizations 
during fiscal second quarter ended december   we announced the divestiture or discontinuation of certain of our commodity products totaling approximately million of annual revenues  to further focus our resources on value added opportunities 
we estimate that charges associated with the restructuring will be approximately million 
these charges will consist of approximately million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million of raw material and work in process inventory  and approximately million for severance 
of the million in total charges  we expect cash charges to be approximately million 
as of june   we have achieved approximately million in annualized savings from the restructuring activities and expect to realize annualized savings of over million by calendar year end  with approximately percent of that savings affecting cost of goods sold 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded million in total charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges and million for severance related costs 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded million in total restructuring related charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million for raw material and work in process inventory charges  and million for severance related costs 
restructuring related costs were charged in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
asset impairments were calculated in accordance with sfas no 
in determining the asset groups  we grouped assets at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows information was available 
in determining whether an asset was impaired we evaluated undiscounted future cash flows and other factors such as changes in strategy and technology 
the undiscounted cash flows from our initial analyses were less than the carrying amount for certain of the asset groups  indicating impairment losses 
based on this  we determined the fair value of these asset groups using the present value technique  by applying a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows that is consistent with the rate used when analyzing potential acquisitions 
as of june   we had recorded million in total charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million for raw material and work in process inventory charges  and million for severance related costs 
components of the million asset impairment  plant closure and other charges included the following items as we emphasize more advanced generation planar products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facilities in temecula  california to decrease significantly 
these facilities had a net book value of million and were written down by million 
it is expected that these facilities will continue in use until approximately december and the remaining basis is being depreciated over units of production during this period 
it is assumed that salvage value will equal disposition costs 
as we emphasize more advanced generation trench products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facility in el segundo  california to decrease significantly 
this facility had a net book value of million and was written down by million 
this facility had significantly reduced production as of fiscal year end and  and is being used primarily for research and development activities 
as we emphasize more advanced generation schottky products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facility in borgaro  italy to decrease significantly 
this facility had a net book value of million and was written down by million 
it is expected that this facility will continue in use until approximately december and the remaining basis is being depreciated over units of production during this period 
it is assumed that salvage value will equal disposition costs 
we are in the process of restructuring our manufacturing activities in europe  which included a review of our swansea  wales facility  a general purpose module facility 
based on a review  we determined that this facility would be better suited to focus only on automotive applications 
the general purpose assembly assets in this facility  with a net book value of million  were written down by million 
in addition  we are moving most manufacturing activities at our recently acquired automotive facility in krefeld  germany to our swansea  wales and tijuana  mexico facilities 
we expect the move to be completed by fiscal second quarter we have also moved the majority of the production from our veneria  italy facility to our mumbai  india facility  which was completed as of december  we stopped manufacturing activities in our oxted  england facility as of september   and the remaining inventory was transferred to our tijuana  mexico assembly facility 
we have eliminated the manufacturing of our non space products in our santa clara  california facility as of july  going forward  subcontractors will handle our non space qualified products formerly manufactured in this facility 
we are also transitioning certain assembly of government and space products from our leominster  massachusetts facility to our tijuana  mexico facility 
associated with this reduction in manufacturing activities  certain assets with a net book value of million were written down by million 
million in other miscellaneous items were charged  including million in relocation costs and other impaired asset charges and million in contract termination and settlement costs 
as a result of the restructuring initiatives  certain raw material and work in process inventories were impaired  including products that could not be completed in other facilities  materials that were not compatible with the processes used in the alternative facilities  and materials such as gases and chemicals that could not readily be transferred 
based on these factors we wrote down these inventories  with a carrying value of million  by million 
as of june  and  we had disposed of million and million  respectively  of these inventories  which did not have a material impact on gross margin for the fiscal years then ended 
our restructuring activities are expected to result in severance charges of approximately million through december below is a table of approximate severance charges by major activity and location location activity amount el segundo  california close manufacturing facility million santa clara  california eliminate certain manufacturing activities million oxted  england close manufacturing facility million veneria  italy move manufacturing to india and discontinue certain products million company wide realign business processes million total million to date  of the million noted above  we have recorded million in severance related charges million in severance termination costs related to approximately  administrative  operating and manufacturing positions  and million in pension termination costs at our manufacturing facility in oxted  england 
for the years ended june  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in severance termination costs and million and million  respectively  in pension termination costs 
the severance charges associated with the elimination of positions  which included the  persons notified to date  had been and will continue to be recognized ratably over the future service period  as applicable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we measured the total termination benefits at the communication date based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date 
a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash over the future service period will be measured using the credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to initially measure the liability 
the cumulative effect of the change will be recognized as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
in fiscal  we had recorded an estimated million in severance costs associated with the acquisition of technofusion gmbh in krefeld  germany 
in fiscal  we finalized our plan and determined that total severance would be approximately million  and accordingly  we adjusted purchased goodwill by million 
we communicated the plan and the elimination of approximately positions primarily in manufacturing to its affected employees at that time 
the associated severance is expected be paid by fiscal second quarter the following summarizes our severance accrued related to the technofusion acquisition and the december restructuring plan for the fiscal years ended june  and severance activity related to the elimination of administrative and operating personnel as part of the previously reported restructuring in the fiscal quarter ended june   is also disclosed

we continue to secure new designs for our proprietary products and to expand proprietary product content in target applications 
gross profit margin for the twelve months ended june  and  gross profit was million and million and of revenues  respectively 
compared to the prior year  the gross profit margin decline primarily reflected continued price pressure on multi market components 
for example  the average selling price of our hexfet products  which accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal component product sales  decreased by approximately percent compared to fiscal the decline in gross margin from the prior year was partially offset by more stable pricing of our proprietary products 
selling and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june   selling and administrative expense was percent of revenues  compared to percent of revenues in the twelve months ended june  the decline in the selling and administrative expense ratio primarily reflected a higher revenue base in fiscal and efforts to keep selling and administrative expenses down in light of the growth in revenue base

the lower effective tax rate reflected foreign tax credits and research and development credits  partially offset by higher statutory tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain foreign losses without foreign tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash and cash equivalent balances of million and cash investments in marketable debt securities of million 
our cash  cash equivalents  cash investments in marketable debt securities and unused credit facilities of million  totaled million 
our investment portfolio consists of available for sale fixed income  investment grade securities which we have managed to obtain effective maturities of no longer than months as of june  during fiscal  operating activities generated cash flow of million compared to million in the prior year period 
cash flow from operations included million of depreciation and amortization and million of tax benefit from options exercised for the twelve months ended 
changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash by million for the twelve months ended june  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to a decrease in inventory resulting from improvements in inventory management and market conditions and the timing of accrued taxes and salaries and wages payable  partially offset by lower accounts payable due to timing and higher accounts receivable as a result of a higher revenue base 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities totaled million

the collateral requirement of the transactions may be adversely affected by an increase in the five year libor curve  a decrease in our stock price  or both 
we cannot predict what the collateral requirement of the transactions and the letter of credit requirement will be over time 
to illustrate the potential impact  had a percent increase in the five year libor curve and a percent decrease in our stock price occurred at the close of the fiscal quarter  our letter of credit commitment would have been the minimum amount required of million 
we lease certain of our administrative  research and development and manufacturing facilities  regional sales service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating and capital leases 
as of june   the following lists our contractual obligations for the next five years payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years years years thereafter long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases      purchase commitments   total       we believe that our current cash and cash investment balances  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity  including unused amounts under the million credit facility with bnp paribas see note  bank loans and long term debt  will be sufficient to meet our currently foreseeable operating cash requirements and to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they occur in the next twelve months 
although we believe that our current financial resources will be sufficient for normal operating activities  we may also consider the use of funds from other external sources  including  but not limited to  public or private offerings of debt or equity

critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when the evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and delivery or performance of service has occurred 
we recognize the majority of revenues upon shipment for product sales to all customers  including distributors  with provisions for estimated returns and allowances recorded at the time of shipment 
certain customers have limited rights of returns and price protection programs 
we continuously monitor product returns and potential price adjustments and record a provision for these based on notification we receive of pending credits and historical experience 
while such credits have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same predictability in estimating returns and allowances 
if the historical data and estimates we used to calculate these provisions do not properly reflect future activity  our net sales  gross profit  net income and earnings per share could be impacted 
certain of our customers contracts contain substantive acceptance provisions 
in such circumstances  we recognize revenue in accordance with specific contract acceptance provisions  in most instances upon customer inspection or upon delivery of proof of conformance to customer specifications 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
inventories are reviewed for excess and obsolescence based upon demand forecasts within a specific time horizon and reserves are established accordingly 
long lived assets long lived assets are net property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to a significant change in business strategy or in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant negative change in the business climate  industry conditions  economic conditions or market value of an asset  and current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets based on the expected undiscounted cash flows for their asset group as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  without regard to taxes 
impairments  if any  are recognized based upon the fair value of the assets 
fair value is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
we use the undiscounted cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate that is representative of the discount rate we use when evaluating potential acquisitions 
in developing our cash flow projections  we use revenue and cost assumptions based on current levels adjusted for anticipated future market conditions 
if these market conditions do not materialize  our cash flow forecasts could be materially impacted 
goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets we classify the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition as goodwill 
we classify intangible assets apart from goodwill if the assets have contractual or other legal rights or if the assets can be separated and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
depending on the nature of the assets acquired  the amortization period may range from four to twelve years for those acquisition related intangible assets subject to amortization 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets  including the related amortization period  in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization  we compare the total carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization to our fair value as determined by our market capitalization 
in evaluating intangible assets subject to amortization  we assess the carrying value of each intangible asset in accordance with sfas no 
derivative financial instruments our primary objectives for holding derivative financial instruments are to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment and hedge non us currency risks 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets  other long term assets or long term debt 
our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on our criteria for designation as hedging transactions  either as cash flow or fair value hedges as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
a cash flow hedge refers to the hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of an asset or a liability  or of a forecasted transaction 
a fair value hedge refers to the hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability  or of an unrecognized firm commitment 
the criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction and  in most cases  a one to one matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction 
we recognize gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes currently in earnings 
these gains and losses generally offset changes in the values of hedged assets  liabilities or debt 
for currency forward contracts  we measure the effectiveness of the hedge using forward rates to value the forward contract and the forward value of the underlying hedged transaction 
for interest rate swaps  we measure the effectiveness using regression analysis  which offsets the change in fair value of the long term debt with the change in fair value of the interest rate swap 
we recognize in current period s interest and other income and expense  depending on the nature of the underlying asset or liability  the ineffective portions of the hedge  as well as  the amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness 
if we determined that the original hedged transaction probably will not occur as anticipated  and a cash flow hedge is to be discontinued  we would reclassify the unrealized gains or losses into earnings 
we would recognize subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument in income in each period until the instrument matures  is terminated or is sold

does not apply to awards prior to statement of caution under the private securities litigation reform act of this form k report includes some statements and other information that are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the materials presented can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  should  view  or will or the negative or other variations thereof 
we caution that such statements are subject to a number of uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
factors that could affect our actual results include those set forth below under factors that may affect future results and other uncertainties disclosed in our reports filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
factors that may affect future results downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end market demand could affect our operating results and the value of our business 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the value of our business may decline during the down portion of these cycles 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the recent past  while we appear to be at the end of a significant and prolonged downturn  we cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to recover fully from its recent downturns could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although markets for semiconductors appear to be improving  we cannot assure you that they will continue to improve or that our markets will not experience renewed  possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future 
in addition  we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales  seasonality  changes in product mix  price competition for orders and the costs associated with the introduction of new products 
the markets for our products depend on continued demand in the communications  consumer electronics  information technology  automotive  industrial and government space markets  and these end markets may experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of  our restructuring programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
in december  we announced a number of restructuring initiatives 
our goal was to reposition our company to better fit the market conditions  de emphasize our commodity business and accelerate the move to what we categorize as our proprietary products 
the restructuring includes consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advanced technology platforms or products 
the restructuring also includes lowering overhead costs across our support organization 
we cannot assure you that these restructuring initiatives will achieve their goals or accomplish the cost reductions planned 
additionally  because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the costs reductions could adversely affect productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these restructuring activities  and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseen factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully of transforming our business to one led by our proprietary products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
the semiconductor business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce the value of an investment in our company 
the semiconductor industry  including the sector in which we do business  is highly competitive 
competition is based on price  product performance  product availability  quality  reliability and customer service 
price pressures may emerge as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices 
we compete in various markets with companies of various sizes  many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have  and thus they may be better able to pursue acquisition candidates and to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
new technologies could result in the development of new products and a decrease in demand for our products  and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand 
our failure to develop new technologies or react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products  which could result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to our competitors 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the semiconductor industry 
as a result  we must devote significant resources to research and development 
our financial performance depends on our ability to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner  or that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within the industry 
in addition  to remain competitive  we must continue to reduce die sizes and improve manufacturing yields 
we cannot assure you that we can accomplish these goals 
our failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain technologies may negatively affect our financial results 
our future success and competitive position may depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products  which is achieved in part by defending and maintaining the validity of our patents and defending claims by our competitors of intellectual property infringement 
we license certain patents owned by others 
we have also been notified that certain of our products may infringe the patents of third parties 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations  we cannot eliminate the risk of litigation alleging patent infringement 
we are currently a defendant in intellectual property claims and we could become subject to other lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others 
our involvement in existing and future intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense  adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
if any such infringements exist  arise or are claimed in the future  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent owners  discontinue or change our processes or products or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in such efforts or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms 
our failure to develop or acquire non infringing technologies or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms or the occurrence of related litigation itself could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to risks 
we have traditionally relied on our patents and proprietary technologies 
patent litigation settlements and royalty income substantially contribute to our financial results 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights is costly  risky and time consuming 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully continue to protect our intellectual property rights  especially in foreign markets 
our key mosfet patents expire between and  although our broadest mosfet patents expire in and our royalty income is largely dependent on the following factors the remaining terms of our mosfet patents  the continuing introduction and acceptance of products that are not covered by our patents  remaining covered under unexpired mosfet patents  the defensibility and enforceability of our patents  changes in our licensees unit sales  prices or die sizes  and the terms  if any  upon which expiring license agreements are renegotiated 
market conditions and mix of licensee products  as well as sales of non infringing devices can significantly affect royalty income 
any decrease in our royalty income could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our international operations expose us to material risks 
we expect revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
we maintain or contract with significant operations in foreign countries 
among others  the following risks are inherent in doing business internationally changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including tax laws in the united states and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  transportation delays  work stoppages  economic and political instability  and foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  it is more difficult in some foreign countries to protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as is possible in the united states 
therefore  the risk of piracy or misuse of our technology and products may be greater in these foreign countries 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operating results as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in the future 
delays in initiation of production at new facilities  implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex  require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities  defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have from time to time experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes 
as a consequence  we have experienced delays in product deliveries and reduced yields 
we may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
interruptions  delays or cost increases affecting our materials  parts or equipment may impair our competitive position and our operations 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment  including silicon  mold compounds and leadframes  on a timely basis from third parties 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs of materials  parts or equipment increase significantly 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
we have a limited number of suppliers for some materials  parts and equipment  and any interruption could materially impair our operations 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our wafer product at our temecula  california and newport  wales facilities 
any disruption of operations at those facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  some of our products are assembled and tested by third party subcontractors 
we do not have any long term assembly agreements with these subcontractors 
as a result  we do not have immediate control over our product delivery schedules or product quality 
due to the amount of time often required to qualify assemblers and testers and the high cost of qualifying multiple parties for the same products  we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we are forced to find alternative third parties to assemble or test them 
any product delivery delays in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these subcontractors were disrupted or terminated 
we must commit resources to product manufacturing prior to receipt of purchase commitments and could lose some or all of the associated investment 
we sell products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the manufacturing of products without any advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and distributors 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues has come from a relatively small number of customers and distributors 
the loss or financial failure of any significant customer or distributor  any reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or distributors  or the cancellation of a significant order  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel required to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
personnel with the necessary semiconductor expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing key technical  sales  marketing and managerial employees or that we will be successful in attracting  assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are acquiring and may continue to acquire other companies and may be unable to successfully integrate such companies with our operations 
we have acquired several companies over the past three years 
we may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies with our operations  or if integration is more difficult than anticipated  we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products may be found to be defective  claims may be asserted against us and we may not have sufficient insurance 
one or more of our products may be found to be defective after we have already shipped the products in volume  requiring a product replacement or recall 
we may also be subject to product returns that could impose substantial costs and have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability or commercial claims may be asserted with respect to our products 
although we currently have product liability or commercial insurance for certain types of losses  we cannot assure you that we have obtained sufficient insurance coverage for all types of commercial or other losses  that we will have sufficient insurance coverage in the future or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any claims 
large potential environmental liabilities  including those relating to a former operating subsidiary  may adversely impact our financial position 
federal  state  foreign and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials  chemicals and gases used in our semiconductor manufacturing processes 
in addition  under some laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated  even if we did not cause the contamination 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
further  we cannot assure you that changes in environmental laws or regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future 
any failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to serious liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
some of our facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines 
our corporate headquarters  one of our manufacturing facility  one of our research facility and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines 
we could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
although we maintain earthquake insurance  we can give you no assurance that we have obtained or will maintain sufficient insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
semiconductor manufacturing requires a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  existing cash reserves and other equity or debt financings that we may obtain will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditure requirements  there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that alternative sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
final outcomes from the various tax authorities audits are difficult to predict and an unfavorable finding may negatively impact the financial results 
we are currently under audit by various taxing authorities 
it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter 
we have provided certain tax reserves which have been included in the determination of our financial results 
however  unpredicted unfavorable settlement may require additional cash and negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers  and make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not discussed or quantified in the following analyses  as well as risks set forth under the heading factors that may affect future results 
interest rate risk our financial assets and liabilities subject to interest rate risk are cash investments  convertible debt  credit facilities and interest rate swaps 
our primary objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
at june   we evaluated the effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on these transactions 
a change of as much as ten percent in the london interbank offered rate libor would have had an annualized favorable impact of approximately million on net interest income expense since the interest income on our cash and cash investments would have outweighed additional interest expense on our outstanding debt 
for our interest rate contract with lehman brothers  an increase of ten percent in interest rates would have had a favorable impact of million  and a decrease of ten percent in interest rates would have had an adverse impact of million  on net interest income expense 
these changes would not have had a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction the transaction with jp morgan chase bank the bank  to modify our effective interest payable with respect to million of our million outstanding convertible debt the debt see notes  derivative financial instruments  and  bank loans and long term debt 
at the inception of the transaction  interest rates were lower than that of the debt and we believed that interest rates would remain lower for an extended period of time 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction the april transaction with the bank to modify the effective interest payable with respect to the remaining million of the debt 
the variable interest rate we have paid since the inception of the swap has averaged percent  compared to a coupon of percent on the debt 
during the fiscal years ended  and  these arrangements reduced interest expense by million  million and million  respectively 
accounted for as fair value hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the mark to market adjustments of the two transactions were offset by the mark to market adjustments on the debt  resulting in no material impact to earnings 
to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship  we use a regression analysis 
to evaluate the relationship of the fair value of the transaction and the changes in fair value of the debt attributable to changes in the benchmark rate  we discount the estimated cash flows by the libor swap rate that corresponds to the debt s expected maturity date 
in addition  our ability to call the debt was considered in assessing the effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
for those years that were projected to include at least a portion of redemption of the convertible debentures  we employed a valuation model known as a monte carlo simulation 
this simulation allows us to project probability weighted contractual cash flows discounted at the libor swap rate that corresponded to the debt s expected maturity date 
the market value of the transaction of million and million asset position at june  and  respectively  was included in other long term assets 
the market value of the april transaction was a million liability position and was included in other long term liabilities 
in april  we entered into an interest rate contract the contract with an investment bank  lehman brothers lehman  to reduce the variable interest rate risk of the transaction 
the notional amount of the contract is million  representing approximately percent of the debt 
under the terms of the contract  we have the option to receive a payout from lehman covering our exposure to libor fluctuations between percent and percent for any four designated quarters 
the market value of the contract at june  and  was million and million  respectively  and was included in other long term assets 
interest expense was increased by mark to market losses of million  million and million  for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
foreign currency risk we conduct business on a global basis in several foreign currencies  and at various times  we have currency exposure related to the british pound sterling  the euro and the japanese yen 
our risk to the european currencies is partially offset by the natural hedge of manufacturing and selling goods in both us dollars and the european currencies 
considering our specific foreign currency exposures  we have the greatest exposure to the japanese yen  since we have significant yen based revenues without the yen based manufacturing costs 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using foreign exchange forward contracts  including the forward contract described below  to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established revenue  expense and balance sheet hedging programs 
currency forward contracts and local yen and euro borrowings are used in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we considered an adverse near term change in exchange rates of ten percent for the british pound sterling  the euro and the japanese yen 
such an adverse change  after taking into account our derivative financial instruments and offsetting positions  would have resulted in an annualized adverse impact on income before taxes of less than million for the fiscal years ended june   and in march  we entered into a five year foreign exchange forward contract the forward contract for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted intercompany purchases by our subsidiary in japan 
we have designated the forward contract as a cash flow hedge under which mark to market adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity  until the forecasted transactions are recorded in earnings 
under the terms of the forward contract  we are required to exchange billion yen for million on a quarterly basis from june to march at june   seven quarterly payments of billion yen remained to be swapped at a forward exchange rate of yen per us dollar 
the market value of the forward contract was a liability of million at june   and an asset of million at june  the mark to market gains losses  net of tax  of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  was included in other comprehensive income 
based on effectiveness tests comparing forecasted transactions through the forward contract expiration date to its cash flow requirements  we do not expect to incur a material charge to income during the next twelve months as a result of the forward contract 
we had approximately million and million in notional amounts of forward contracts not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
at june  and  respectively 
net realized and unrealized foreign currency gains losses recognized in earnings  excluding any impact from forward contracts  were less than million for the fiscal years ended june   and
