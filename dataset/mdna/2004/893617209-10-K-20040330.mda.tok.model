item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction tci invests in real estate through acquisitions  leases and partnerships and in mortgage loans on real estate  including first  wraparound and junior mortgage loans 
tci is the successor to a california business trust organized on september   which commenced operations on january  on november   tci acquired all of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of cmet  a real estate company  in a tax free exchange of shares  issuing shares of its common stock for each outstanding cmet share 
tci accounted for the merger as a purchase 
prior to january   tci elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
during the third quarter of  tci no longer met the requirement for tax treatment as a reit due to a concentration of ownership 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of tci s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
tci s critical accounting policies relate to the evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and the evaluation of the collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  management performs a recoverability analysis based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows the property is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if management decides to sell rental properties or land held for development  management evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized within income from continuing operations 
tci s estimates of cash flow and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
tci s estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and tci s assessments of them change 
in the fourth quarter of  tci recognized million and  as impairment losses  and in the second and third quarter of  tci recognized million and  as impairment losses 
tci s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor and tci s assessment of its ability to meet its lease or interest obligations 
tci s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions 
tci s management periodically discusses criteria for estimates and disclosure of its estimates with the audit committee of tci s board of directors 
obligations and commitments tci has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to the payment of mortgages 
the following table aggregates tci s expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities tci s long term debt may contain financial covenants that  if certain thresholds are not met  could allow the lender to accelerate principal payments or cause the note to become due immediately 
other long term liabilities represent tci s intentions to purchase the interests of general and limited partners formed to construct residential properties 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the principal reasons for the change in cash are discussed in the paragraphs below 
tci s principal sources of cash have been and will continue to be from property operations  proceeds from property sales  and the collection of mortgage notes receivable  borrowings and to a lesser extent  distributions from partnerships 
management anticipates that tci s cash at december   along with cash that will be generated in from property operations  will not be sufficient to meet all of tci s cash requirements 
management intends to selectively sell income producing real estate  refinance or extend real estate debt and seek additional borrowings against real estate to meet its cash requirements 
historically  management has been successful at extending its current maturity obligations 
management also anticipates funding ongoing real estate construction projects and the acquisition of new real estate from cash generated by property sales  debt refinancings or extensions  and additional borrowings 

table of contents net cash provided by operations was million in compared to net cash used in operations of million in and  in cash flow from property operations is rents collected less payment for property operating expenses or net rental income 
the increase in operating cash from to was due to an increase in net rental income from new apartments that finished construction in and and an increase in commercial net rental income due to centura tower  which was purchased in june cash also increased due to less spending on general and administrative expenses from to these gains were offset by the sales of real estate during and and from higher interest expense paid during net cash used in property operations decreased from to due lower net rental income from the sale of commercial properties and apartments in and and an increase in interest paid in these decreases in were offset by lower spending on general and administrative expenses and advisory fees  as well as an increase in interest income collected 
management believes that cash flow may decrease from property operations as a result of selling of income producing properties 
management expects that funds from existing cash resources  selective sales of income producing properties  refinancing of real estate  and additional borrowings against real estate will be sufficient to meet tci s cash requirements associated with its current and anticipated level of operations  maturing debt obligations and existing commitments 
to the extent that tci s liquidity permits or financing sources are available  management intends to make new real estate investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and net cash provided of million in cash from investing activities increased in due to tci spending less on real estate construction and improvements and an increase in payments received from tci s advisor 
these cash increases were offset by cash decreases due to less collected on notes receivable  less real estate sold  the purchase of marketable securities and increases in deposits on pending real estate purchases 
cash from investing activities decreased from to due to a substantial increase in real estate construction in and an increase in payments made to tci s advisor 
these decreases in cash were offset by an increase in cash due to higher collections on notes receivable during net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and net cash used of million in cash from financing activities decreased in due to higher payments on notes payable and lower proceeds from notes payable refinancings and property sales as compared to cash from financing activities decreased from to due to higher proceeds from notes payable  offset by higher payments on notes payable in was also lower due to the repurchase of common stock in a private block purchase 
management reviews the carrying values of tci s properties and mortgage notes receivable at least annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
impairment is considered to exist if  in the case of a property  the future cash flow from the property undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the property 
for notes receivable impairment is considered to exist if it is probable that all amounts due under the terms of the note will not be collected 
if impairment is found to exist  a provision for loss is recorded by a charge against earnings 
the note receivable review includes an evaluation of the collateral property securing such note 
the property review generally includes selective property inspections  a review of the property s current rents compared to market rents  a review of the property s expenses  a review of maintenance requirements  a review of the property s cash flow  discussions with the manager of the property  and a review of properties in the surrounding area

environmental matters under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  tci may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other potential costs  relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property where property level managers have arranged for the removal  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may seek recovery for personal injury associated with such materials

inflation the effects of inflation on tci s operations are not quantifiable 
revenues from property operations tend to fluctuate proportionately with inflationary increases and decreases in housing costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk tci s future operations  cash flow and fair values of financial instruments are partially dependent upon the then existing market interest rates and market equity prices 
market risk is the changes in the market rates and prices  and the effect of the changes on future operations 
market risk is managed by matching a property s anticipated net operating income to an appropriate financing 
tci is exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced 
tci does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its 
table of contents portfolio of real estate assets 
tci s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by tci s finance department 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
tci s earnings are affected as changes in short term interest rates impact its cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt 
a large portion of tci s market risk is exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings 
the impact on tci s financial statements of refinancing fixed debt that matured during was not material 
as permitted  management intends to convert a significant portion of those borrowings from variable rates to fixed rates in if market interest rates for variable rate debt average basis points more in than they did during  tci s interest expense would increase  and income would decrease by million 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on tci s borrowing cost 
this analysis did not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in tci s financial structure 
the following table contains only those exposures that existed at december  anticipation of exposures or risk on positions that could possibly arise was not considered 
tci s ultimate interest rate risk and its effect on operations will depend on future capital market exposures  which cannot be anticipated with a probable assurance level
