item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to such consolidated financial statements also included in this form k 
some of the information that follows are not statements of historical fact but merely reflect our intent  belief or expectations regarding the anticipated effect of events  circumstances and trends 
such statements should be considered as forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations 
factors that might cause or contribute to differences between our expectations and actual results include uncertainty of market acceptance of our products by the worldwide medical community  risk that other companies may develop and market tests for human papillomavirus competitive with our own  uncertainty regarding patents and propriety rights in connection with our products and products in development  uncertainty as to ongoing litigation  our need to obtain third party reimbursement approval from government entities  managed care organizations  and private insurance plans  our ability to scale up our manufacturing to the extent demand for our products increases  our limited sales and marketing experience  the extent of future expenditures for sales and marketing programs  delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for our products in development  uncertainty of clinical trial results for our products in development  uncertainty of future profitability and cash generation from operations  our ability  if necessary  to obtain requisite additional financing to fund our operations beyond calendar year  risks inherent in international transactions  including those relating to our expansion in europe and elsewhere  and other factors as set forth under the caption risk factors beginning on page overview since our incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing  manufacturing and marketing our proprietary gene based testing systems using our patented hybrid capture technology for the screening  monitoring and diagnosis of human diseases 
we have been profitable since the fourth quarter of fiscal  however  from our inception until that time  we incurred substantial operating losses  resulting principally from expenses associated with our research and development programs  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory submissions for our products  the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and our global sales and marketing activities 
our revenues  to a significant extent  have been derived from the sales of our diagnostic tests for the presence of human papillomavirus hpv  which  for fiscal  accounted for of total revenues 
we expect that the growing acceptance of hpv testing in cervical cancer screening programs  both in the united states and internationally  will continue to drive the growth in revenues from our hpv test products in the future 
in fiscal  our gross margins on product sales increased to as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  we believe that we will be able to sustain gross margins consistent with fiscal we believe that continuing to increase the investments we make in our sales and marketing and in research and development activities is essential to allow us to capitalize more fully on the potential of our hpv test products and our core technology 
during fiscal one significant area of investment was in our european infrastructure and distribution operations  and we expect to continue such investment in fiscal we are also expanding our sales organization in the united states 
we have increased our expenditures in the development of our next generation hybrid capture platforms and other research and development programs related to hpv testing in fiscal as compared to fiscal and expect to continue to increase such expenditures in fiscal our sales and marketing expenditures have been and will continue to be focused on accelerating the adoption of hpv testing worldwide 
we intend to capitalize on the expanded indications for use of our hpv test products and the growing acceptance of our hpv test products in the united states and internationally by physicians  laboratories and health insurance providers by materially increasing expenditures for sales and marketing programs over the next several quarters 
this increase in expenditures will be primarily directed at our markets in the united states and europe 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase to provide adequate infrastructure to support greater sales and marketing activities and more focused research and development activities  to pay the anticipated costs associated with our ongoing litigation matters and to support the overall growth of our business 
although we anticipate increasing our expenditures as described above  we anticipate that factors such as the impact of our ability to sustain our gross margins will offset the impact such increased expenditures would have on our operating profits 
we expect the operating profits which we experienced for the first time at the end of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal will continue through fiscal there can be no assurance that we will meet this goal 
results of operations fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands product sales hpv test product revenue cost of product sales gross margin comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales increased as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to a growth in sales of our hpv test products to approximately  and an increase in equipment sales of  to approximately  as compared to approximately  in fiscal the majority of the growth in our hpv test product revenue was in the united states  which increased to approximately  and in europe  which increased  to approximately  in the united states  most of the growth in our hpv test product sales related to the commercial launch of our dnawithpap test for adjunctive cervical cancer screening with a pap test for women age and older  an indication approved by the us food and drug administration fda in march the increase in revenues from equipment sales primarily related to sales of our rapid capture system following the may fda approval of the use of such automated system to perform our diagnostic tests 
the growth in product sales in europe related to the success of our subsidiary operating companies and distributor operations benefiting from our coordinated sales and marketing programs  public awareness campaigns and government education efforts 
other revenues include research and development contract revenues  equipment rental revenues and licensing revenues 
other revenues increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase of approximately  in research and development contract revenue 
cost of product sales in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased product sales volume 
gross margins on product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal our gross margins in fiscal were impacted by costs of approximately  associated with a voluntary product recall in fiscal  costs of approximately  due to a fiscal increase in reserves in anticipation of planned product discontinuations in europe in december  other changes in our products offerings and charges of approximately  after insurance proceeds  for a freezer failure in september  which resulted in damaged inventory 
the fiscal gross margin also increased due to approximately  of manufacturing efficiencies related to production scale ups  product consolidations and process improvements implemented during fiscal these increases in gross margin were partially offset by increased sales of equipment  which have lower gross margins than our diagnostic test products 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in expenditures was due primarily to a increase in personnel costs to approximately  and a increase in laboratory supplies to approximately  partially offset by a decrease in professional services of to approximately  the decrease in professional services was due largely to decreased expenditures in fiscal  as compared to the costs incurred in fiscal  to obtain ce marking for our hpv  chlamydia and gonorrhea diagnostic test products in accordance with the european union in vitro diagnostic directive  which ce marking was successfully accomplished in december our research and development activities focus on our platform technology  including substantial modifications of the design or capabilities of our products and equipment offerings 
because our research and development expenditures tend to benefit multiple product offerings  we do not track and maintain research and development expenses on a per product or per disease target basis 
in fiscal  we focused our research and development activities in four areas core research efforts for next generation technologies  new product development activities  completion of activities necessary to support regulatory submissions to seek approvals to market our existing products for additional uses and indications in the us and abroad  and modification of the design or capabilities of our product and equipment offerings 
our core research efforts for next generation technologies include research programs with the goal of developing improved molecular diagnostic assay systems for the detection of hpv and other targets of interest in the area of women s cancers and infectious diseases  and research on our next generation of hybrid capture technology 
our new product development activities currently focus on the discovery of innovative methods to improve specimen processing procedures and throughput to expand the ability of laboratories to use our diagnostic tests 
the activities include procedures for the improved processing of preservcyt cytyc corporation specimens and upgrades of our equipment offerings for high throughput hpv  chlamydia and gonorrhea testing 
we are also working to expand hpv testing capabilities to allow testing from additional liquid cytology media  including our proprietary universal collection medium ucm  which is expected to allow simultaneous nucleic acid testing  protein analysis and cytological testing of human papillomavirus dna  chlamydia dna and gonorrhea dna  and of other genetic and cellular material from a single patient sample  and the surepath tm tripath imaging medium  for which the clinical validation is ongoing 
we have also completed development of a software improvement for our rapid capture system to permit the simultaneous testing of multiple dna probes  and to improve the related laboratory processes and procedures 
in addition  in november we entered into a collaborative product development and commercialization agreement with path program for appropriate technology in health to develop a rapid batch hpv test product for use in developing countries 
digene and path will jointly fund the efforts subject to certain maximum funding obligations  and digene will perform the product development and commercialization activities 
during the second half of fiscal we completed the establishment of a research team to pursue this program and began active research into a rapid batch hpv test product candidate 
with respect to regulatory submissions in fiscal we developed and completed the clinical validation of our rapid capture system for semi automated processing of our hc high risk hpv dna tests 
we initially submitted the pre market approval supplement to the fda on november  we provided follow up data and information on april  to facilitate completion of the fda s review 
we received this approval on may  we expect this claim will expand existing indications for our hc high risk hpv dna test to allow high volume  semi automated human papillomavirus dna testing 
developed and completed the clinical validation of the use of chlamydia ct and gonorrhea gc testing using our hc ct gc tests from cytyc corporation s thinprep preservcyt solution specimens 
we submitted k pre market notifications for each of our test products for chlamydia and gonorrhea each test separately plus our combined hc ct gc test between november and january the fda s review of these submissions is ongoing and we continue to work with the fda during this period to provide the information needed to facilitate completion of its review 
finally  with respect to modification of the design or capabilities of our diagnostic test products and equipment offerings  in fiscal we achieved technical feasibility of our next generation platform proprietary dna test for ultra sensitive detection of dna targets in a highly multiplexed modality 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased to approximately  agency fees  which increased to approximately  professional services  which increased to approximately  and expenses related to the development of physician conferences and education  which increased to approximately  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in royalties expense  which decreased to approximately  due primarily to the reversal of an accrual of approximately  based on the reduced probability that a specific royalty liability would materialize 
the increase in personnel costs relates to our increased hiring activities 
the increase in agency fees relates to costs under our physician detailing agreement with pdi  inc pdi recruits and administers a digene specific physician detailing sales organization dedicated to educating physicians about the benefits of the dnawithpap test in the united states 
the professional services increase is due largely to the use of consultants to assist with the rapid growth of our distribution infrastructure in europe 
geographically  the majority of the increase in our selling and marketing expenses for fiscal  excluding royalties  was incurred in the united states  which increased to approximately  as compared to approximately  in fiscal  as we expanded our direct sales and marketing activities in the united states to increase sales of our hpv test products 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase during fiscal as we continue to expand our direct sales and marketing activities to increase hpv test product sales  continue the build up of our direct sales and marketing operations in europe and commercialize our ct gc products 
as part of our commercialization program for the dnawithpap test  we have extended our contract with pdi  inc  dedicated to promoting the dnawithpap test to physicians 
we expect to continue to increase our investment in physician education to promote the commercialization of the dnawithpap test 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased to approximately  insurance  which increased to approximately  principally related to increased costs for directors and officers insurance coverage  and professional fees  which increased to approximately  primarily related to costs associated with legal matters  which increased to approximately geographically  the majority of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal was incurred in europe  which increased  to approximately  over the corresponding period in fiscal as we invested in infrastructure required to support the direct distribution of our products in europe 
interest income decreased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was due to lower interest rates in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal interest expense decreased to approximately  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal primarily due to the reduction in our long term debt due to abbott laboratories as quarterly principal payments were made on an outstanding promissory note  which lowered the debt 
other income decreased to approximately  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  due almost entirely to reduced foreign exchange gains as exchange rate fluctuations were not as significant in fiscal as they were in the net income tax benefit of approximately  in fiscal is primarily related to the partial release of the valuation allowance previously established against our deferred tax assets 
we released approximately  of valuation reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal based upon projected future operating performances  we currently believe that we will be able to utilize a portion of the value of our net operating loss carryforward nol through the reduction of future taxable income 
during fiscal  the amount of valuation allowance we released was the estimated amount to be utilized in the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had total nol carryforwards of approximately million  however  we did not reverse the portion of the valuation allowance related to the potential tax benefits from the exercise of stock options as realization of these benefits are not likely at this time 
should realization of these benefits become more likely than not  the benefit will be reflected as a reclassification to stockholders equity 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to a growth in sales of our hpv test products to approximately  partially offset by a decrease in sales of equipment and certain non core products of approximately  
the majority of the growth in hpv product sales was in the united states over such sales in fiscal and in europe over such sales in fiscal 
during fiscal  we did not recognize any revenue related to minimum purchase guarantees under the roche distribution contract  whereas in fiscal we recognized approximately  please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the roche distribution contract 
other revenues included research and development contract revenues  equipment rental revenues and licensing revenues 
other revenues decreased almost in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to reductions in research and development services revenue of approximately  and licensing revenue of approximately  
the decrease was partially offset by the recognition of  of certain equipment sales to roche in europe  which were initially deferred in the fourth quarter of fiscal please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the roche distribution contract 
cost of product sales in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal gross margins on product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage primarily related to increased sales of our higher margin reagent test kits  particularly hpv tests products  which represented  or approximately  of product revenue in fiscal compared to  or approximately  in fiscal  principally in the united states  as well as decreased sales of lower margin equipment products that represented  or approximately  of product revenue in fiscal compared to  or approximately  in fiscal cost of product sales was negatively impacted in fiscal because of a voluntary product recall  resulting in a charge to cost of product sales of approximately  during february we initiated a voluntary recall involving our hc hpv and chlamydia test products 
this recall was limited to certain product lots which were manufactured using a specific lot of raw material that had the potential to cause false positive patient specimen results 
we informed the fda of the recall 
we conducted an investigation into the root cause of this product performance issue for our hybrid capture product line  and developed a raw material release testing corrective action plan 
on june   the fda approved the modification of our lot release testing procedures related to the component that relied on the raw material found to have been contaminated 
because this voluntary recall was limited to an identified lot of raw material  we were able to supply our customers with product manufactured from acceptable raw material lots 
in addition  we expanded our ongoing quality improvement program to ensure continued reliability as manufacturing volume increases to meet anticipated growth in demand for our diagnostic test products 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in expenses was due primarily to a increase in professional services and clinical trial expenses  to approximately  partially offset by a decrease in personnel costs  which decreased to approximately  and laboratory supplies  which decreased to approximately  the increase in professional services was due largely to costs incurred of approximately  in preparation for compliance with the ce marking requirements of the european union in vitro diagnostic directive 
our research and development activities focus on our platform technology  including different or modified uses of such technology  and improvements to our diagnostic test and equipment products 
because our research and development expenditures tend to benefit multiple product offerings  we do not track and maintain research and development expenses on a per product or per disease target basis 
during fiscal  we focused our research and development activities on completing regulatory activities to add new claims and indications to existing products in the us and abroad  support and improvement of existing product lines  the development of several new products and core research efforts for next generation technologies 
work continued on the development of a hybrid capture hpv test product application for our automated rapid capture system  including accommodating the use of multiple dna probes in a single run in conjunction with our current product lines  the development of methods to improve specimen processing procedures and throughput  including procedures for the improved processing of cytyc corporation s thinprep specimens for hpv  chlamydia and gonorrhea testing  improved equipment for faster specimen processing  and the development of our universal collection medium 
in addition  verification was completed and clinical trials initiated for a method for converting specimens collected in tripath imaging s surepath liquid cytology medium  clinical trials occurred to validate chlamydia and gonorrhea testing from cytyc corporation s thinprep specimens  a human papillomavirus application for our rapid capture system  and a procedural modification to our hc assay designed to improve test robustness 
work was completed on an hpv thinprep application using cervical specimens collected with a brush spatula device and the data were submitted to the fda 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased to approximately  and royalty expenses  which increased to approximately  in addition  depreciation expense increased to approximately  in fiscal  due primarily to the may repurchase of equipment from abbott laboratories upon expiration of the non exclusive wind down period of our distribution agreement with abbott 
additionally  professional services increased to approximately  due largely to the use of consultants to assist with the rapid growth of our distribution infrastructure in europe 
geographically  the majority of the increase in our selling and marketing expenses for fiscal  excluding royalties  was incurred in europe  which increased to approximately  over the corresponding period in fiscal as we established subsidiaries  hired employees and continued to develop a distribution infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to professional fees  which increased to approximately  primarily related to costs associated with legal matters  which increased to approximately  personnel costs  which increased to approximately  and insurance  which increased to approximately  principally related to increased costs for directors and officers insurance coverage 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of  during fiscal due to strong collection efforts of outstanding receivables 
geographically  the majority of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal was incurred in europe  which increased to approximately  over the corresponding period in fiscal due to our change to direct distribution  and in the united states  which increased over the corresponding period in fiscal to approximately  due primarily to the aforementioned litigation expenditures 
interest income decreased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average cash balances and lower interest rates in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal interest expense increased to approximately  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal due to interest on long term debt due to abbott laboratories as part of the repurchase of equipment at the end of fiscal under a terminated distribution agreement  and interest on a promissory note due to roche molecular diagnostics as a result of the repurchase of inventory from roche in january other income increased to approximately  in fiscal from a loss of approximately  in fiscal primarily due to foreign exchange gains and losses 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our expenses have significantly exceeded our revenues  resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately  at june  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and revenues from product sales and research and development contracts 
at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating approximately  we had positive cash flows from operations of approximately  for the year ended june  compared to negative cash flows from operations of approximately  for the year ended june  the increase in cash provided from operations was due primarily to net income for fiscal of approximately  which included a deferred tax benefit of  compared to a net loss of approximately  for fiscal  partially offset by an increase of approximately  in the cash used for net accounts receivable due to increased sales in fiscal net cash used in investing activities for fiscal included approximately  of capital expenditures 
this included approximately  of equipment placed at customer sites  which allows our customers to run diagnostic tests using our reagent test kit products  and approximately  of leasehold improvements  primarily at our headquarters facility in gaithersburg  maryland 
in fiscal we expect both of these types of capital expenditures to be significant uses of working capital as we continue to place equipment at customer sites  specifically rapid capture systems  and as we further expand our warehouse capacity at our gaithersburg facility  for which we may obtain alternative financing 
on april   we entered into a letter agreement with roche molecular systems the roche distribution contract  which established roche molecular systems roche as the co exclusive distributor of our human papillomavirus hpv products in europe  africa and the middle east from may  through june  in june  we adopted as our sole strategy for the distribution of our hpv products in europe  africa and the middle east  a combination of direct distribution through our european infrastructure and the use of local distributors and agents 
on june   the term of the roche distribution contract expired  subject to a non exclusive wind down period 
under the roche distribution contract  we had the option  exercisable within days after december   to buy back from roche equipment purchased from us by roche and in use for hpv testing in customer s laboratories on june  in june  as part of our strategic decision  we decided that we would exercise the option to repurchase the equipment 
in recognition of the decision to repurchase the equipment  commencing in the fourth quarter of  we deferred recognition of equipment sold to roche 
equipment sold during this time period had a sales price of million and a cost of million  which amounts were recorded as deferred revenue and deferred costs  respectively 
the deferred revenue and deferred costs were being amortized over a four year period to other revenue as equipment rental and selling and marketing expenses  respectively 
for fiscal  we recorded other revenue and selling and marketing expenses of  and  respectively  related to the amortization of these balances 
for fiscal  we recorded other revenue and selling and marketing expenses of  and  respectively  related to the amortization of these balances prior to the commencement of the repurchase 
at december   when amortization ceased  the remaining deferred revenue and deferred cost balances were  and  respectively  for a remaining net credit as of december  of on december   we amended the roche distribution contract to terminate the wind down period on december  and to establish the procedures for our repurchase from roche of hpv related testing equipment purchased from us by roche under the roche distribution contract 
the repurchase price for the equipment in use for hpv testing in customers laboratories is the equipments december  depreciated value  which is the net selling price less any amounts roche recorded as depreciation based on a straight line basis over a four year period 
the repurchase price for the equipment in inventory is a discount from the transfer price paid by roche under the roche distribution contract 
the parties consummated the hpv equipment repurchase on january   subject to reconciliation 
in january digene and its affiliates paid roche an aggregate of approximately million for the hpv equipment in inventory and in use at customers laboratories in europe 
a portion of the purchase price was paid by the issuance of a note payable due to roche  which was paid in one installment in january  and the remainder of the purchase price was paid in cash 
a final settlement for the repurchased assets was completed with roche in june the total consideration paid to roche for the fixed assets and inventory after reaching a final settlement was  or  after consideration of the remaining net credit of  mentioned above 
we anticipate that working capital requirements will increase moderately for the foreseeable future due to the investment necessary to support our european direct distribution operations  as well as increasing accounts receivable as a result of expected revenue growth 
prior to this fiscal year  we had incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
we have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts  expand our sales and marketing activities and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations through calendar our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds may change  however  based on numerous factors  including our degree of success in commercializing our products  our progress in product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  our success in increasing and maintaining customer relationships  our ability to receive additional regulatory approvals for our product offerings  the cost and timing of expansion of our manufacturing capabilities  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and competitive market developments 
to the extent that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
we do not have any committed sources of additional financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
under such conditions  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we have summarized below our material contractual obligations as of june  in thousands contractual less than one year one to three years four to five years after five years obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after fiscal long term debt physician detailing agreement operating leases total contractual cash obligations includes debt payable to abbott laboratories related to the repurchase of equipment in fiscal critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our consolidated financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows inventory management 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a weighted average approach  which approximates the first in first out method of inventory management 
we also record provisions for inventories which may not be salable due to anticipated trends in sales volume and or pricing and our estimates of net realizable value 
these provisions are determined based on significant estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we establish allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns and discounts based on historical default rates and specifically identified problem accounts 
additionally  we defer approximately two percent of product sales as a reserve for future warranty costs and recognize this deferred revenue over one year  which is the standard warranty period for a majority of our system components 
at june  and  the warranty reserve was approximately  and  respectively  and  historically  the warranty costs have been within management estimates 
accounting for employee stock options 
we account for our employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 and related interpretations  which allow us to recognize compensation costs for the excess of the fair value of the stock at the grant date over the exercise price  if any 
an alternative method of accounting would apply the principles of sfas no 
 which require the fair value of the stock option to be recognized at the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense over the stock option s vesting period 
had we applied the principles of sfas no 
for our employee options  our net loss would have been approximately  and  during our fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  and our net income would have been approximately  during our fiscal year ended june   instead of our reported net losses which approximated  and  during our fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  and our reported net income of approximately  during our fiscal year ended june  income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we recognized an income tax benefit of  for the year ended june   primarily related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax asset 
realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
due to the uncertainty of realization of these tax benefits  in fiscal we have provided a valuation allowance for the portion of the net operating loss carryforward and the research and development credits related to the exercise of stock options and the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and credits expected to expire unused 
we review our deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required  primarily based on our estimates of future taxable income 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a valuation allowance and an expense in the period of change 
substantially all of the remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance  if released  will be reflected as a direct increase to stockholders equity and will not impact the consolidated statement of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our exchange rate risk comes from our operations in europe and south america 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities on earnings was immaterial for the years ended june   and interest rate exposure is primarily limited to the million of cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments owned by us 
such investments are money market debt securities that generate interest income for us on cash balances 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of our investments 
we do not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on our business
