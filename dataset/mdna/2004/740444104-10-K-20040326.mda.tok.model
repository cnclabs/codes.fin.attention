item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market overview the current domestic regulatory environment in the energy and communication sectors continues to discourage the incumbent energy and service providers from investing in the maintenance and upgrading of their infrastructure as long as new companies are allowed to continue to piggyback on the installed networks at low costs 
the blackout in the northeast on august  focused the country s attention on the need for rebuilding and enhancing the domestic infrastructure grid 
although the need to address rebuilding the national power grid and communications infrastructure was pushed to the forefront  the timing of this undertaking remains uncertain 
this task will most likely be undertaken by a combination of private companies and government agencies over several years 
the regional bell telephone companies bells and independent telephone companies are the company s primary customers in the telecommunications market 
a federal communications commission fcc ruling in dictated that these bells must continue leasing their lines to rivals such as worldcom and at t corp 
the bells claim that the lease rates are below their cost of providing service 
consequently  the incentive for the bells to increase capital investment is minimized 
however  the bells and independent telephone companies are beginning to invest in the fiber to the premise fttp infrastructure and service while requesting further clarification on the fcc rules on sharing their investment in the new infrastructure with their competitors 
while foreign energy and communications markets were flat in most regions of the world  the markets in the americas remained depressed in due to the use of wireless technology  the demand for fixed line communication networks does not offer the same opportunity for growth in certain developing countries telecommunication markets

approximately million of the charge is related to asset write downs  of which million of inventory write offs were recorded in costs of products sold and million of write offs related to receivables were included in costs and expenses on the statement of consolidated operations 
the remaining million of the charge  included in costs of products sold and costs and expenses  relates to cash outlays for employee severance cost  cost of exiting leased facilities  the termination of other contractual obligations and transitional costs

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the critical accounting policies are limited to those that are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company records estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during the company recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million and at december  the allowance represents of its trade receivables  compared to at december  sales returns and allowances the company records a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and other known factors  such as open authorized returns 
at december  these provisions accounted for less than 
of consolidated net sales  compared to less than 
at december  if future returns do not reflect the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates  additional allowances or reversals of established allowances may be required 
excess and obsolescence reserves the company has provided an allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence based on estimates of future demand  which is subject to change 
additionally  discrete provisions are made when facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be utilized 
at december   the allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence was of gross inventories  compared to at december  if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or reversals of existing reserves may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
the company s cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill the company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
the company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles have been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  the company believes that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
the company performs interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
there were no trigger events during and as such only an annual impairment test was performed 
during the fourth quarter  the market valuation of one domestic reporting unit had decreased  such that it was highly probable that the related goodwill would not be recoverable 
therefore  at december   the company had recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the company s global operations 
as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes the political and economic risks related to the company s foreign operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countries in which the company s largest foreign operations are located 
the company has foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  whose fair values and carrying values are approximately 
million and mature in less than one year 
a change in the foreign currency rates would have resulted in a favorable unfavorable impact on foreign currency translation expense of less than 
million for the year ended december  the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 
million for the year ended december  the company s primary currency rate exposures are related to foreign denominated debt  intercompany debt  forward exchange contracts and cash and short term investments 
a hypothetical change in currency rates would have a favorable unfavorable impact on fair values of million and on income before tax of 
million
