the following discussion of our financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with item selected financial and other data and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
results of operations financial reporting during reorganization in connection with our bankruptcy proceedings  we were required to report in accordance with statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  sop 
sop requires  among other things  i that pre petition liabilities that are subject to compromise be segregated in our consolidated balance sheet as liabilities subject to compromise and ii the identification of all transactions and events that are directly associated with our reorganization in the consolidated statement of operations 
seasonality typically  movie studios release films with the highest expected revenues during the summer and the holiday period between thanksgiving and christmas  causing seasonal fluctuations in revenues 
however  movie studios are increasingly introducing more popular film titles throughout the year 
revenues we derive almost all of our revenues from box office admissions and concession sales 
we recognize admissions revenues when movie tickets are sold at the box office  and concession sales revenues when the products are sold in the theatre 
admissions and concession sales revenues depend primarily upon attendance  ticket price and the price and volume of concession sales 
our attendance is affected by the quality and timing of movie releases and our ability to obtain films that appeal to patrons in our markets 
expenses film exhibition costs vary according to box office admissions and are accrued based on the specified splits of receipts in firm term agreements with movie distributors 
the agreements usually provide for a decreasing percentage of box office admissions to be paid to the movie 
table of contents studio over the first few weeks of the movie s run  subject to a floor for later weeks 
where firm terms do not apply  film exhibition costs are accrued based on estimates of the final settlement that is agreed between us and the movie studio after the completion of the movie s run 
concession cost of sales are incurred as products are sold 
we purchase substantially all of our beverage supplies from the coca cola company 
we purchase substantially all of our other concession supplies from a single vendor of which we are the principal customer 
other theatre operating costs include labor  utilities and occupancy  and facility lease expenses 
labor costs have both a variable and fixed cost component 
during non peak periods  a minimum number of staff is required to operate a theatre facility 
however  to handle attendance volume increases  theatre staffing and thus salaries and wages vary in relation to revenues 
utilities  repairs and maintenance services also have variable and fixed costs components 
our occupancy expenses and property taxes are primarily fixed costs  as we are generally required to pay applicable taxes  insurance and fixed minimum rent 
our general and administrative expenses include costs not specific to theatre operations  and are composed primarily of corporate overhead 
net operating losses as of december   after utilizing approximately million for  we had approximately million of federal and state operating loss carryforwards with which to offset our future taxable income 
net operating losses may be carried back and then forward for specified periods 
if they are not used to offset taxable income by the end of the carryforward period  they expire 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  a corporation may generally be restricted in utilizing its net operating losses to offset prospective taxable income if it experiences an ownership change  as defined in section g 
the determination as to whether a corporation has experienced an ownership change on a given date is a complex analysis of the beneficial stock ownership of the corporation over a time period of not more than three years 
an ownership change under section g occurs when on a testing date  the beneficial ownership of the corporation by one or more percent stockholders has increased  in the aggregate  by more than percentage points over the respective lowest ownership percentages of such percent stockholders during the testing period preceding such date 
it should be noted that the rules for determining whether an ownership change under section has occurred are different from those applied to evaluate whether a change in ownership as defined by statement of position has occurred 
the determination of whether we underwent an ownership change for purposes of section as a result of the issuance of common stock pursuant to our plan of reorganization the plan stock issuance is subject to a number of highly complex legal issues and factual uncertainties 
in our federal income tax return for  we reported the plan stock issuance as causing a section ownership change  although the matter is not free from doubt and arguments can be advanced to support the contrary position 
based on our reported tax treatment  we believe that the special exception in section i available to debtors in bankruptcy applied  so that our net operating loss carryforwards did not become subject to a section limitation as a result of 
table of contents the plan stock issuance 
if  however  we underwent a second ownership change within two years following our date of reorganization that is  by january  and assuming that the plan stock issuance caused an ownership change  our net operating losses would have become subject to a section limitation of zero and their future use effectively would have been eliminated 
while we do not believe that the sale of our common stock in the offering we completed on february  caused a second ownership change  future changes in the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of our common stock  which may be beyond our control  could trigger an ownership change and thus limit  or possibly eliminate altogether  our ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards in a subsequent taxable year 
if it were determined that we did not undergo an ownership change as a result of the plan stock issuance  the recently completed issuance of common stock from our equity offering could be deemed to have triggered an ownership change  which would cause our net operating loss carryforwards to become subject to an annual limitation on their use equal to the value of our equity immediately prior to the date of the ownership change  subject to certain adjustments  multiplied by the applicable federal long term tax exempt interest rate

therefore  the million valuation allowance was released creating an income tax benefit for the positive evidence management considered included operating income for and  our subsequent stock offering and refinancing  resulting in significant prospective interest expense reduction  and anticipated operating income and cash flows for future periods in sufficient amounts to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we recognized an income tax benefit of million in additionally  we will pay approximately thousand in alternative minimum taxes for the year ended december  the income tax benefit recorded in is the result of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which allowed for additional carryback of net operating losses resulting in a cash refund of approximately million

because we receive our revenues in cash prior to the payment of related expenses  we have an operating float which partially finances our operations 
we had a working capital deficit of million as of december  compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  the change in working capital as of december  reflects a reduction in cash related to payments made to long term debt under our reorganization plan and a reclassification of recoverable construction allowances from current to long term  offset by the effect of financial accounting standard no 
classification of short term obligations expected to be refinanced 
we had a working capital deficit of million at december  compared to a working capital deficit of million as of december  the working capital deficit as of december  reflects cash settlements required at emergence from chapter  as well as  mandatory payments defined in the plan of reorganization

for the year ended december   we made capital expenditures of approximately million 
as discussed below under material credit agreements and covenant compliance we refinanced our post bankruptcy credit facilities subsequent to december  our new revolving credit agreement limits our annual capital expenditures to million per year  plus any unused portion 
table of contents may be carried over to the succeeding year 
we anticipate using the maximum amount allowed for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this change is due to increased profit from operations related primarily to lower interest expenses  offset by changes in accounts payable  payments to general unsecured creditors and other reorganization items

net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million in this increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to emergence from chapter  which allowed us to increase capital spending 
for the year ended december  cash used in financing activities was million compared to million in the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to scheduled and mandatory payment requirements of our long term debt agreements 
our liquidity needs are funded by operating cash flow  sales of surplus assets  availability under our new credit agreements and short term float 
the exhibition industry is very seasonal with the studios normally releasing their premiere film product during the holiday season or summer months 
this seasonal positioning of film product makes our needs for cash vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
additionally  the ultimate performance of the film product  any time during the calendar year  will have the most dramatic impact on our cash needs 
our ability to service our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate this cash will depend largely on future operations 
based upon our current level of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash  sales of surplus assets and borrowings under our new credit agreements will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
however  the possibility exists that  if our liquidity needs are not met and we are unable to service our indebtedness  we could come into technical default under any of our debt instruments  causing the agents or trustees for those instruments to declare all payments due immediately or  in the case of the senior debt  to issue a payment blockage to the more junior debt 
a similar situation contributed to the circumstances that led us to file our voluntary petition for relief under chapter in august  as described in our reorganization 
we cannot make assurances that our business will continue to generate significant cash flow to fund our liquidity needs 
we are dependent to a large degree on the public s acceptance of the films released by the studios 
we are also subject to a high degree of competition and low 
table of contents barriers of entry into our industry 
in the future  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or raise additional capital through other means  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we have insufficient cash flow to fund our liquidity needs and are unable to refinance our indebtedness or raise additional capital  we could come into technical default under our debt instruments as described above 
in addition  we may be unable to pursue growth opportunities in new and existing markets and to fund our capital expenditure needs 
material credit agreements and covenant compliance as described below  our credit and leasing facilities contain certain restrictive provisions which  among other things  limit additional indebtedness  limit capital expenditures  limit the payment of dividends and other defined restricted payments  require that certain debt to capitalization ratios be maintained and require minimum levels of defined cash flows 
upon our emergence from bankruptcy our indebtedness consisted of a term loan credit agreement  the post bankruptcy term loan credit agreement  a revolving credit agreement  the post bankruptcy revolving credit agreement  and senior subordinated notes 
in a series of transactions completed on february   we replaced the post bankruptcy term loan credit agreement  the post bankruptcy revolving credit agreement and the senior subordinated notes with the indebtedness described below 
new financing transactions on february   we completed an offering of million of senior subordinated notes due to institutional investors and entered into new senior secured credit facilities consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million five year term loan

the impairment charge recognized in was significantly larger than in prior years due to the write off of leasehold improvements on theatres for which we rejected leases  the impact of closing owned theatres  the diminished value of our entertainment centers and the write down of surplus equipment removed from closed or rejected theatres 
additionally  in we included impairment charges related to equipment of million  based on our reduced capital building program for the future as well as the excess supply of equipment in inventory

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to leasing transactions  depreciation of property and equipment  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies and  in particular  those related to impairment of long lived assets including goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and such difference could be material 
all critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

assets held for disposal are reported at the lower of the asset s carrying amount or its fair value less costs to sell 
amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included with depreciation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
although we use accelerated methods of depreciation for income tax purposes  for financial reporting purposes  we compute depreciation on a straight line basis as follows building and improvements years leasehold improvements years leasehold interests years equipment years number of years is based on the terms of the applicable lease impairment of property and equipment  including goodwill effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in general  sfas no 
requires that we assess the fair value of the net assets underlying our acquisition related goodwill on a business by business basis 
we consider all of our consolidated operations to be our reporting unit for sfas no 
purposes 
we evaluate goodwill impairment by comparing discounted cash flows against carrying values 
where that fair value is less than the related carrying value  we have reduced the amount of the goodwill 
these reductions were made retroactive to january  sfas no 
also requires that we discontinue the amortization of our acquisition related goodwill 
as of december   our financial statements included acquisition related goodwill of million  net of previous amortization 

table of contents we account for our property and equipment in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically review and monitor our internal management reports and the competition in our markets for indicators of impairment 
we consider a trend of operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
an additional impairment indicator used by management is the existence of competition in a market  either from third parties or from our own expansion 
for purposes of sfas no 
 assets are evaluated for impairment at the theatre level except when multiple theatres are located in the same geographic area 
management believes this is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
we deem there to be an impairment if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the theatre or market  including estimated disposal value if any  is less than its carrying amount 
if there is a determination of an impairment  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the theatre or market exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on management s estimates which are based on using the best information available  including prices for similar theatres or the results of valuation techniques such as discounting estimated future cash flows 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
see asset impairments above for additional information regarding the effects on the and consolidated financial statements 
bankruptcy matters as debtors in possession  we had the right  subject to bankruptcy court approval and certain other limitations  to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases during our reorganization 
any damages resulting from rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases were treated as general unsecured claims in our reorganization 
during our reorganization  we received approval from the bankruptcy court to reject theatre leases on of our theatre locations 
we estimate that our aggregate liability at december  for general unsecured creditors is approximately million  which includes our estimated liability for damages resulting from the rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases which we have not already paid 
as of december   total accrued interest on those claims was million 
of these claims  million are disputed 
as such  we cannot presently determine with certainty the ultimate liability that may result  however  the bankruptcy court still maintains jurisdiction over certain matters related to the implementation of the plan of reorganization  including the unresolved disputed claims 
we have made our best estimate of such liability given the facts available at this time 
if we are unable to resolve these claims with the unsecured creditors we may petition the bankruptcy court to resolve them 
leases we operate most of our theatres under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
these leases generally provide for the payment of fixed monthly rentals  property taxes  common area 
table of contents maintenance  insurance and repairs 
certain of these leases provide for escalating lease payments over the terms of the leases 
moreover  certain leases also include contingent rental fees based on a percentage of sales 
at our option  we can renew a substantial portion of our theatre leases  at the then fair rental rate  for various periods with the maximum renewal period generally totaling years 
for financial statement purposes  the total amount of base rentals over the terms of the leases is charged to expense on the straight line method over the initial lease terms 
rental expense in excess of lease payments is recorded as a deferred rental liability and is amortized to rental expense over the remaining term of the lease 
percentage rent several leases have a contingent component called percentage rent 
percentage rent is based on a percentage of defined revenue factors over a fixed breakpoint for the lease year as described within the lease 
we accrue for this contingent liability monthly based on the trailing twelve months activity of the affected theatre 
payment of this liability is defined within the lease and the accrual is reconciled at the end of the lease year 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  measured by enacted tax rates 
in we established a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we periodically review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
for the year ended december   we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
accordingly  the valuation of approximately million was released and a deferred tax asset of million was recognized 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is currently effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after february  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after march  we currently believe adoption of fin will not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
with the exception of certain measurement criteria deferred indefinitely by the fasb  sfas no 
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not currently have any such instruments and therefore the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
information about forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
in addition  we  or our executive officers on our behalf  may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the sec or in connection with oral statements made to the press  potential investors or others 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about our beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include statements preceded by  followed by or that include the words  believes  expects  anticipates  plans  estimates or similar expressions 
these statements include  among others  statements regarding our strategies  sources of liquidity  and the opening of new theatres during forward looking statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of performance 
these statements are based on beliefs and assumptions of our management  which in turn are based on currently available information 
important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include  among others  assumptions regarding expected pricing levels  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
these assumptions could prove inaccurate 
the forward looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the following the availability of suitable motion pictures for exhibition in our markets  competition in our markets  competition with other forms of entertainment  the effect of our leverage on our financial condition  and other factors  including the risk factors discussed on pages through in this annual report 
we believe these forward looking statements are reasonable  however  undue reliance should not be placed on any forward looking statements  which are based on current expectations 
further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
we have floating rate debt instruments and  therefore  are subject to the market risk related to changes in interest rates 
interest paid on our debt is largely subject to changes in interest rates in the market 
our new revolving credit agreement and our new five year term loan credit agreement are based on a structure that is priced over an index or libor rate option 
an increase of in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our million term loan credit agreement  million on an annual basis 
if our million revolving credit agreement was fully drawn a increase in interest rates would increase interest expenses  on an annual basis 
the interest rate on our senior subordinated notes is fixed and changes in interest rates will have no effect on annual interest expense 
a substantial number of our theatre leases have increases contingent on consumer price index cpi changes 
a change in cpi would not have a material effect on rent expense
