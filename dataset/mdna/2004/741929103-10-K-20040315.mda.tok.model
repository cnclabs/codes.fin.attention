item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview overview we are a global  facilities based telecommunications services provider offering an integrated portfolio of international and domestic voice  internet  voip  data and hosting services to business and residential retail customers and other carriers located primarily in the united states  australia  canada  the united kingdom and europe 
our focus is to service the demand for high quality  competitively priced international communications services that is being driven by the globalization of the world s economies  the worldwide trend toward telecommunications deregulation and the growth of internet  voip and data traffic 
generally  we price our services competitively with the major carriers operating in our principal service regions 
we expect to continue to generate net revenue from internal growth through sales and marketing efforts focused on customers with significant communications needs international and domestic voice  internet and data  including smes  multinational corporations  residential customers  particularly ethnic customers  and other telecommunications carriers and resellers  as well as acquisitions 
having completed our global network infrastructure deployment  our primary operational focus is on building scale in our core markets by adding customers and traffic 
the combination of network ownership and increasing scale provides us with the ability to reduce our cost structure  improve service quality and reliability  and introduce new products and services 
prices in the long distance industry have declined in recent years  and as competition continues to increase with each of the service segments and each of the product lines  we believe that prices are likely to continue to decrease 
additionally  we believe that because deregulatory influences have begun to affect telecommunications markets outside the united states  the deregulatory trend will result in greater competition that could adversely affect our net revenue per minute 
however  we believe that any such decreases in our prices will be more than offset by increased communications usage of our network and decreased costs 
in addition to the global economy s expanding need for communications services  we believe that we can achieve growth through the taking of market share from our competitors or the possible acquisition of customer bases or competing companies 
as the portion of traffic transmitted over leased or owned facilities increases  cost of revenue increasingly is comprised of fixed costs 
in order to manage such costs  we pursue a flexible approach with respect to the expansion of our network capacity 
in most instances  we initially obtain transmission capacity on a variable cost  per minute leased basis  then acquire additional capacity on a fixed cost basis when traffic volume makes such a commitment cost effective  and ultimately purchase and operate our own facilities when traffic levels justify such investment 
we also seek to lower the cost of revenue through optimizing the cost of traffic by using the least expensive cost routing  negotiating lower variable usage based costs with domestic and foreign service providers and negotiating additional and lower cost foreign carrier agreements with the foreign incumbent carriers and others  continuing to expand the capacity of our network when traffic volumes justify such investment  and increased use of the public internet 
we believe the current network meets the near term needs of our current and prospective customers and that capital expenditures will be in the range of of net revenue in we expect these spending levels to remain consistent over the next few years 
in most countries  we generally realize a higher margin on our international long distance as compared to our domestic long distance services and a higher margin on our services to both business and residential customers compared to those realized on our services to other telecommunications carriers 
in addition  we generally realize a higher margin on long distance services as compared to those realized on local switched and cellular services 
we also generally realize a higher margin on our internet access and data services as compared to voice services 
carrier services over a fixed line network  which generate a lower margin than retail business and residential services  are an important part of net revenue because the additional traffic volume of such carrier customers improves the utilization of the network and allows us to obtain greater volume discounts from our suppliers than we otherwise would realize 
also  carrier services over voip have higher margins than carrier services over a fixed line network 
overall carrier revenue accounted for  and of total revenue during the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the provision of carrier services also allows us to connect our network to all major carriers  which enables us to provide global coverage 
our overall margin may fluctuate based on the relative volumes of international versus domestic long distance services  carrier services versus business and residential long distance services  internet and data services versus voice services and the proportion of traffic carried on our network versus resale of other carriers services 
we have also selectively targeted opportunities for us to participate in major growth areas for telecommunications local  wireless and broadband 
our approach in each of these areas has common elements focus on bundling services to end user customers with international calling patterns  leverage our existing global voice  data and internet network  and utilize our established distribution channels and back office systems 
we believe the local services market is an untapped opportunity for revenue growth for us  as the regulatory environment promotes more competition 
we recently began offering local line service in canada  bundled with our other product offerings of long distance and internet access  in competition with the ilecs 
we are currently a local service provider in australia offering resale and dsl services 
we will explore opportunities for providing local services in the united states 
the ability to bundle local service for our existing customer base and attract new customers to our existing services presents future growth opportunities for us 
our wireless initiative will target as potential new customers all wireless users in our existing major markets europe  united states  canada  and australia who wish to make international calls using their mobile phones 
currently  many wireless users are blocked by their service provider from making international calls  and those that can make international calls are charged excessively high rates 
through a combination of service initiatives  including dial around services  special pin personal identification number services  and primus branded intelligent handsets  we will target the users of wireless carriers and offer substantially reduced international rates 
even with reduced rates  we believe our services would generate substantial margins 
from the wireless customer s perspective  there is no need to change their underlying wireless service provider or phone number what we will offer is a value added service that will provide a customer substantial cost savings on international calls 
the current high rates for international calls from wireless phones has artificially suppressed this potentially large market  we intend to make international calling easy and affordable for wireless users 
the target customers for our broadband voip products will be anyone who has a broadband connection anywhere in the world 
we have been in the carrier voip market now for several years and carried over one billion minutes of international voice traffic in over the public internet 
we are preparing currently to launch retail enterprise  reseller and residential voip services around the globe which are expected to have higher profit potential than fixed line carrier services 
we will leverage our already deployed next generation voip network connecting approximately countries and supported by the most up to date voice technology 
we anticipate that these three additional product lines local  wireless and broadband have the potential to become as large as our existing wireline products and drive future growth in our revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  occupancy costs  sales and marketing expenses  advertising and administrative costs 
all selling  general and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred  with the exception of direct response advertising  which is expensed in accordance with statement of position  reporting on advertising costs 
to further the above initiatives  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of net revenue until our net revenue growth is realized and expect to leverage our current spending levels for future initiatives 
we have seen our debt reduction efforts result in a trend of decreasing interest expense since such efforts began in december we will continue to reduce debt through regularly scheduled principal payments and will also consider other available means 
we will also continue to seek opportunities to secure more favorable financing terms that will enhance liquidity by either extending the principal payment schedule or reducing interest rates 
foreign currency 
currently in excess of of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the usd 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country 
in the future  we expect to continue to derive the majority of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs from outside the united states  and therefore changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on our results of operations 
our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused primarily by fluctuations in the following exchange rates usd aud  usd cad  usd gbp  and usd euro dollar eur 
due to the large percentage of our revenue derived outside of the united states  strengthening of the usd relative to one or more of the foregoing currencies  could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations 
we have agreements with certain subsidiaries for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to these subsidiaries 
as we anticipate repayment in the foreseeable future  we recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
we historically have not engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks 
however  the exposure of our income from operations to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is reduced in part because a majority of the costs that we incur in connection with our foreign operations are also denominated in local currencies 
we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into usd using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect the reported profits and losses and cash flows and may distort comparisons from year to year 
by way of example  when the usd strengthens compared to the eur  there is a negative effect on the reported results for europe and takes more profits in eur to generate the same amount of profits in usd 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the usd weakens there is a positive effect 
in the year ended december   the usd weakened compared to the aud  cad  gbp and eur

operating highlights and accomplishments in we received stockholder approval for and closed the remaining million investment in our series c preferred by fund affiliates of aig 
all outstanding shares of our series c preferred were converted into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock on november  we completed an offering of million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes  which we used primarily to retire higher interest debt and to extend our debt maturity profile 
the convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
we continued our debt reduction efforts by retiring million in principal amount of our senior notes  which were funded in part through the proceeds from the convertible senior notes 
in particular  the following debt securities were retired during million principal amount of the senior notes  million principal amount of the january senior notes  and million principal amount of the senior notes 
we further reduced debt by settling an outstanding vendor financing of million for approximately million and the accelerated payoff of million for an equipment financing facility  which were funded in part through the proceeds from the convertible senior notes 
we acquired three canadian isps  one canadian local service provider and a canadian prepaid calling card company for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash 
the purchase price for the prepaid calling card company may increase based on additional consideration to be paid  as provided by the terms of the acquisition agreement  if the acquired company s adjusted revenues exceed certain targeted levels 
operating highlights and other events in in  we focused our attention on continued implementation of our three pronged strategy that was initiated at the end of  which involved improving operating results  reducing debt  and raising additional financing 
initiatives and results from our efforts to improve operating results we focused on higher margin retail customers and services 
we de emphasized or exited certain low margin businesses  and emphasized operations in core markets including the united states  australia  canada and europe 
our australian and canadian subsidiaries both achieved their highest levels to date of operating income for a full fiscal year 
initiatives and results from our efforts to reduce debt we reduced debt during by million to million at december   with a gain on early extinguishment of debt of million for the year 
we reduced interest expense by million over the prior year from the principal reduction of senior notes and convertible debentures effected during and initiatives and results from our efforts to raise additional funds we signed an agreement to issue and sell million of series c preferred including commitments of million from fund affiliates of aig 
we received million on december  in the initial closing of the series c preferred offering 
we obtained million of funding through an extension of an accounts receivable facility with textron 
growth initiatives in in september  we signed an agreement to acquire the united states based sme voice customer base of c w 
we acquired the sme voice customer base during the three months ending december  the acquired customer base has migrated to our network and therefore increased the size of our united states retail business 
we assumed billing  customer support and other back office functions through the scaling of existing systems 
other events our results reflect the deconsolidation of three non core foreign investments  which resulted from the partial divestment of interests in cards parts  our german mobile accessories business  which subsequently filed for insolvency administration  the relinquishment of control rights concerning bekko  our internet and data investment in japan  and an insolvency administration filing for internext  our internet and data subsidiary in france 
operating highlights and other events in in  we focused on implementing our three pronged strategy and concentrated on debt reduction  cost containment and growth in cash flow from operations 
these efforts resulted in the following reduced debt to million at december  from billion in  with a gain on early extinguishment of debt of million for the year  reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by million from the previous year  and reduced interest expense by million over the prior year from the principal reduction of senior notes and convertible debentures 
in addition  in  we recorded an asset impairment write down of million in goodwill  property and equipment  and customer lists  and recorded a million write off of our investment in pilot network services 
critical accounting policies to aid in the understanding of our financial reporting  our most critical accounting policies are described below 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition net revenue is derived from carrying a mix of business  residential and carrier long distance traffic  internet and data traffic  and also from the provision of local and cellular services 
for voice and voip  net revenue is earned based on the number of minutes during a call and is recorded upon completion of a call  adjusted for allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  service credits and service adjustments 
revenue for a period is calculated from information received through our network switches 
customized software has been designed to track the information from the switch and analyze the call detail records against stored detailed information about revenue rates 
this software provides us the ability to analyze timely and accurately the revenue generated in a period 
separate prepaid calling card software is used to track additional information related to the cards usage such as activation date  monthly usage amounts and expiration date 
revenues on these cards are recognized as service is provided until expiration  when all unused minutes which are no longer available to the customers  are recognized as revenue 
provision of internet and data services also generates net revenue 
internet and data services include monthly fees collected for the provision of dedicated and dial up access at various speeds and bandwidths 
these fees are recognized as access is provided on a monthly basis 
additionally  service activation and installation fees are deferred and amortized over the longer of the average customer life or the contract term 
we record payments received in advance for prepaid calling card services including vmns and services to be provided under contractual agreements  such as internet broadband and dial up access  as deferred revenue until such related services are provided 
deferred revenue is reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
net revenue represents gross revenue  net of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  service credits and service adjustments 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable requires significant estimates 
due to the large number of customers that we serve  it is impractical to review the creditworthiness of each of our customers  although a credit review is performed for larger carrier and retail business customers 
we consider a number of factors in determining the proper level of the allowance  including historical collection experience  current economic trends  the aging of the accounts receivable portfolio and changes in the creditworthiness of our customers 
systems to detect fraudulent call activity are in place within our network  but if these systems fail to identify such activity  we may realize a higher degree of uncollectible accounts 
if the estimate of uncollectible revenue was higher than our current estimates  net revenue would have been reduced by approximately million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
cost of revenue cost of revenue is comprised primarily of costs incurred from other domestic and foreign telecommunications carriers to originate  transport and terminate calls 
the majority of our cost of revenue is variable  based upon the number of minutes of use  with transmission and termination costs being the most significant expense 
call activity is tracked and analyzed with customized software that analyzes the traffic flowing through our network switches and calculates the variable cost of revenue with predetermined contractual rates 
if the domestic or foreign telecommunications carriers have tracked and invoiced the volume of minutes at levels different than what our activity shows or have invoiced at different rates  we will dispute the charges invoiced 
there is no guarantee that we will prevail in the dispute 
we use significant estimates to determine the level of success in dispute resolution and consider past historical experience  basis of dispute  financial status and current relationship with vendor  and aging of prior disputes in quantifying our estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we review intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  we compare the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of the long lived assets

this adjustment resulted in an asset impairment write down of million or per share  consisting of the following specific asset write downs million in goodwill  million in property and equipment  and million in customer lists 
the estimated fair value of our assets was based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
in  we recognized million of additional specific write offs which included million of fiber cable in europe which will no longer be used by us  and the goodwill of our german internet subsidiary  iprimus telecommunications gmbh of million identified through our annual impairment test performed on october  interest expense decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease is primarily attributed to million in interest saved from the principal reduction of our senior notes and convertible debentures and extinguishment of our vendor debt and related obligations to hewlett packard 
foreign currency transaction gain loss increased to a gain of million for the twelve months ended december  from a loss of million for the twelve months ended december  the increase is attributable to the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on intercompany debt balances and on receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries functional currency where the settlement of the debt is anticipated within the foreseeable future 
the principal components of the gain are million of unrealized gain on an intercompany receivable held by united states subsidiaries but denominated and payable in cad  as well as million of unrealized gain on an intercompany receivable held by united states subsidiaries but denominated and payable in aud 
the remaining gain of million was earned on the valuation or settlement of customer receivables or vendor payables throughout our subsidiaries 
equity investment write off and loss was million for the twelve months ended december  equity investment losses began to be recognized after the deconsolidation of three of our subsidiaries  bekko  internext and cards parts 
two of those subsidiaries  internext and cards parts  were subsequently written off when their valuation was deemed to be permanently impaired after each filed for insolvency administration 
interest income and other income expense increased to an income of million for the twelve months ended december  from an expense of million for the twelve months ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to the million write off of our investment in pilot network services during the three months ended march  when the investment became permanently impaired 
other cost investments of million were also written off in when they became permanently impaired 
income tax benefit was a million benefit for the twelve months ended december  this benefit was mainly comprised of a reversal of a million tax provision recorded for the amt at december  that resulted from the signing into law of the job creation and workers assistance act of that suspended the limitation of net operating loss carryforward for amt 
the income tax benefit also reflected the net unrealized amount of million of deferred tax assets that were created by canada operating loss carryforwards that are no longer offset by a valuation allowance since the first quarter of it is anticipated that this million will be utilized during the year ending december  the benefit was partially offset by million of foreign withholding tax on intercompany interest owed to our united states subsidiary by our australian and canadian subsidiaries 
gain on early extinguishment of debt decreased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  the gain resulted from our purchase of million in principal amount of senior notes  prior to maturity  for million in cash  slightly offset by the write off of related deferred financing costs 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 resulting in the impairment of the goodwill related to the internext reporting unit  an internet and data subsidiary in france  of million which was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources changes in cash flows our principal liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities  purchases of network equipment including switches  related transmission equipment and capacity  interest and principal payments on outstanding debt and other obligations  and acquisitions 
we have financed our growth and operations to date through public offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities  vendor financing  capital lease financing and other financing arrangements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in operating cash generated was comprised of an increase in revenue of million  and a decrease in cash paid for interest of million 
this increase is offset by cash used by operating activities which includes an increase of million in cost of sales  an increase in sales  general and administrative expenses of million  and additional funds used to pay down our current liabilities  including accounts payable and accrued interconnection costs to reduce further our short term cash requirements 
net cash used by investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to net cash used by investing activities of million for the twelve months ended december  net cash used by investing activities during the twelve months ended december  included million of capital expenditures primarily for our global network and back office support systems as compared to million during the twelve months ended december  most of our acquisitions of businesses were financed through short term debt arrangements  totaling million of such arrangements in with the most significant acquisition being the united states customer list of c w 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   cash used by financing activities consisted of million for the purchase or redemption of certain of our debt securities and million of principal payments on capital leases  vendor financing and other long term obligations  offset by million of net proceeds from the sale of our convertible senior notes  million of financing received through issuance of the second tranche of our series c preferred and million received from other financing 
during the twelve months ended december   cash provided by financing activities consisted of million of net proceeds from issuance of  shares of the series c preferred stock and million received from an accounts receivable financing  offset by million on principal payments on capital leases  vendor financing and other long term obligations  and million for the purchase of certain of our debt securities 
short and long term liquidity considerations and risks we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and internally generated funds from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements and other fixed obligations such as capital leases  vendor financing and other long term obligations  capital expenditures  and other cash needs for our operations through at least the next twelve months 
long term funding may require the issuance of additional debt or equity 
based on historical results and our business forecasts  we believe our plan for short term and long term funding expectations are accurate and achievable 
we believe the current network meets the near term needs of our current and prospective customers and that capital expenditures will be in the range of of net revenue in we expect these spending levels to remain consistent over the next few years 
these capital expenditures are expected to be funded through existing cash and cash equivalents and or internally generated funds 
we have agreed to purchase aol pty ltd aol for million which will be paid in cash in the first quarter of we will continue to have significant debt and debt service obligations during the next twelve months and on a long term basis 
however  there can be no assurance that changes in assumptions or conditions  including those referenced under legal proceedings and special note regarding forward looking statements will not adversely affect our financial condition or short term or long term liquidity position 
as of december   we have million in future operating lease payments and million of indebtedness with payments of principal and interest due as follows includes effect of redemption of million principal amount of the january senior notes and million principal amount of the senior notes  retirement of million of the october senior notes and repayment of million of a financing agreement during the three months ended march   and the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes in january year ending december  vendor financing senior notes senior convertible notes other long term obligations convertible subordinated debentures purchase obligations operating leases total amounts in thousands after february march redemption   thereafter    total minimum principal interest payments   less amount representing interest    we have contractual obligations to utilize network facilities from a long distance carrier with terms greater than one year 
we do not purchase or commit to purchase quantities in excess of normal usage or amounts that cannot be used within one year 
we have minimum annual purchase obligations of million in and the purchase price for tci  the canadian prepaid card company  may increase based on additional consideration to be paid  as provided by the terms of the acquisition agreement  if the acquired company s adjusted revenues exceed certain targeted levels 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which mainly consists of our investment in bekko 
we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions 
we do not guaranty financing obtained by our unconsolidated investments  nor are there any other provisions of the investment agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the investments 
we have entered into indemnification agreements with our executive officers and directors and provide indemnity insurance pursuant to which directors and officers are indemnified or insured against liability or loss under certain circumstances which may include liability or related loss under the securities act and the exchange act 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million which primarily serve as security for vendor relationships 
forward looking liquidity considerations from time to time  we maintain an active dialogue with potential debt and equity investors for raising capital for additional liquidity  debt reduction  refinancing of existing indebtedness and for additional working capital and growth opportunities 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in these efforts to obtain new capital at acceptable terms 
if we are successful in raising additional financing  securities comprising a significant percentage of our diluted capital may be issued in connection with the completion of such transactions 
additionally  if our plans or assumptions change  including those with respect to our debt levels or the development of the network and the level of our operations and cash from operating activities  if our assumptions prove inaccurate  if we consummate additional investments or acquisitions  if we experience unexpected costs or competitive pressures or if existing cash and any other borrowings prove to be insufficient  we may need to obtain such financing and or relief sooner than expected 
in light of the foregoing  we and or our subsidiaries will evaluate and determine on a continuing basis  depending on market conditions and the outcome of events described herein under special note regarding forward looking statements  and future negotiations we may pursue with the holders of certain of our outstanding debt securities and other instruments  the most efficient use of our capital  including investment in our network and systems  lines of business  potential acquisitions  purchasing  refinancing  exchanging or retiring certain of our outstanding debt securities and other instruments in privately negotiated transactions  open market transactions or by other means directly or indirectly to the extent permitted by our existing covenant restrictions 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb adopted sfas no

must be reclassified 
these provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  additionally  sfas no 
requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
these lease provisions are effective for transactions occurring after may  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
during the three months ended march  it was determined that all of our gains loss from early extinguishment of debt for the years ended december    and did not meet the criteria established in apb no 
to be classified as extraordinary items 
for the twelve months ended december   a gain of million from early extinguishment of debt was reported as income from continuing operations 
for the twelve months ended december  and  gains on the early extinguishment of debt of million and million were reclassified to income from continuing operations to maintain comparability for the reported periods

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
that requires business combinations entered into after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
specifically identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are to be amortized over their estimated useful economic life 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized  but should be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and applies to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entity s balance sheet at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
and in connection with our adoption  discontinued the amortization of goodwill and reviewed the estimated useful lives of previously recorded identifiable intangible assets  principally customer lists 
additionally  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to the internext reporting unit which has been reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we followed the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
to test our goodwill for impairment under the transitional goodwill impairment test 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
under the guidelines of sfas no 
 we are required to perform an impairment test at least on an annual basis at any time during the fiscal year provided the test is performed at the same time every year 
on october   we performed our annual test and concluded no impairment existed

special note regarding forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report on form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such statements are based on current expectations  and are not strictly historical statements 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements set forth in this document and elsewhere regarding  among other things expectations of future growth  revenue  foreign revenue contributions and net income  as well as income from operations  earnings per share  cost reduction efforts  cash flow  network development  internet services development  traffic development  capital expenditures  selling  general and administrative expenses  goodwill impairment charges  service introductions and cash requirements  growth  and anticipated profitability of our local service  wireless and voip initiatives  financing  refinancing and or debt repurchase  exchange plans or initiatives  anticipated increased sales and marketing expenses  unanticipated hedging activities  capital expenditure plans  liquidity and debt service forecasts  assumptions regarding currency exchange rates  management s plans  goals  expectations  guidance  objectives  strategies  and timing for future operations  acquisitions  product plans and performance  the revenue or other impact of primus s acquisitions  the impact of matters described under business legal proceedings  and management s assessment of market factors 
factors and risks  including certain of those described in greater detail herein  that could cause actual results or circumstances to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in forward looking statements include  without limitation changes in business conditions  fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies  particularly any strengthening of the usd relative to foreign currencies of the countries where we conduct our foreign operations  adverse interest rate developments  fluctuations in prevailing trade credit terms or revenues due to the adverse impact of  among other things  further telecommunications carrier bankruptcies or adverse bankruptcy related developments affecting our large carrier customers  the possible inability to raise additional capital when needed  or at all  the inability to reduce  repurchase or exchange debt  changes in the telecommunications or internet industry  including rapid technological changes  regulatory changes in our principal markets and the degree of competitive pressure that we may face  adverse tax rulings from applicable taxing authorities  dsl  internet and telecommunications competition  changes in financial  capital market and economic conditions  changes in service offerings or business strategies  difficulty in migrating or retaining customers associated with recent acquisitions of customer bases  or integrating other assets  difficulty in providing local  voip or wireless services  changes in the regulatory schemes or requirements and regulatory enforcement in the markets in which we operate  restrictions on our ability to follow certain strategies or complete certain transactions as a result of its capital structure or debt covenants  risks associated with our limited dsl  internet  voip and web hosting experience and expertise  entry into developing markets  the possible inability to hire and or retain qualified sales  technical and other personnel  and to manage growth  risks associated with international operations  dependence on effective information systems  dependence on third parties to enable us to expand and manage our global network and operations  dependence on the performance of our global atm ip communications network  adverse outcomes of outstanding litigation matters  adverse fcc rulings or fines affecting our operations  the potential elimination or limitation of a substantial amount or all of our united states or foreign operating loss carryforwards due to significant issuances of equity securities  changes in ownership or other circumstances  which carryforwards would otherwise be available to reduce future taxable income  and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities or terrorist acts and adverse geopolitical developments 
as such  actual results or circumstances may vary materially from such forward looking statements or expectations 
readers are also cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements which speak only as of the date these statements were made 
we are not necessarily obligated to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors  which could cause results to differ from expectations  include risks described in greater detail below associated with liquidity restrictions  possible inability to obtain necessary financing 
we believe that our existing cash and internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt service requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other cash needs for our operations at least through march however  there are substantial risks  uncertainties and changes that could cause actual results to differ from our current belief 
see for instance information under liquidity and capital resources short and long term liquidity considerations and risks and in this special note regarding forward looking statements 
if adverse events referenced therein were to occur  we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations and could  among other things  be required to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws of the united states or other similar laws in other countries 
substantial indebtedness  liquidity 
we currently have substantial indebtedness and anticipate that we and our subsidiaries will incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness could make it difficult for us to make required payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt  could limit our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  requires that a substantial portion of our cash flow  if any  be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and other obligations and  accordingly  such cash flow will not be available for use in our business  could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  results in our being more highly leveraged than many of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  and will make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
foreign exchange risks 
a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the usd 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country 
in the future  we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs outside the united states  and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on our results of operations 
our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the following exchange rates usd aud  usd cad  usd gbp  and usd eur 
for the year ended december   our results were favorably impacted by a weakening of the usd compared to the foregoing currencies 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
due to the large percentage of our operations conducted outside of the united states  strengthening of the usd relative to one or more of the foregoing currencies could have an adverse impact on future results of operations 
we historically have not engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks 
in addition  the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in foreign countries have been funded with investments and other advances denominated in foreign currencies 
historically  such investments and advances have been long term in nature  and we accounted for any adjustments resulting from currency translation as a charge or credit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within the stockholders deficit section of our consolidated balance sheets 
in  agreements with certain subsidiaries were put in place for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to the subsidiaries 
as we anticipate repayment in the foreseeable future of these amounts  we will recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations  and depending upon changes in future currency rates  such gains or losses could have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on our results of operations 
limited operating history  entry into local  internet  data and voip business  entry into developing markets 
since  we have been targeting businesses and residential customers for internet and data services through our brand and other businesses 
we have been expanding and intend to continue to expand our offering of internet  data and voip services worldwide 
we anticipate offering a broad range of internet protocol based data and voice communications over our global broadband atm ip network 
currently  we provide internet access services to business and residential customers in the united states  australia  canada  japan  india  brazil and spain  and offer internet transmission services in the indian ocean southeast asia regions through our earth stations in india 
our experience with these services and these markets is limited 
furthermore  the market for dial up and broadband internet connectivity and related services is extremely competitive 
our primary competitors include incumbent operators  cable companies and other isps that have a significant national or international presence 
many of these operators have substantially greater resources  capital and operational experience than we do 
we also expect that we will experience increased competition from traditional telecommunications carriers and cable companies that expand into the market for internet services 
therefore  future operations involving these services may not generate operating or net income on a predictable basis  and we may not be able to successfully expand this part of our business 
managing growth 
our continued growth and expansion may place a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources  and increase demand on our systems and controls 
we have expanded our retail operations through our late acquisition of the sme voice customer base of c w in the united states and the expansion of our prepaid calling card product  particularly in europe 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and controls  purchase and utilize other transmission facilities  and expand  train and manage our employee base 
if we inaccurately forecast the movement of traffic onto our network  we could have insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses 
as we proceed with our development  operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer support  billing and management information systems  on our support  sales and marketing and administrative resources and on our network infrastructure 
for instance  we may encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer other adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required 
in addition  our operating and financial control systems and infrastructure could be inadequate to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting 
historical and future operating losses and net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and a stockholders deficit balance of million 
the company incurred net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in during the year ended december   we recognized net income of million  of which million is the positive impact of foreign currency transaction gains 
our recent net income and net revenue growth should not necessarily be considered to be indicative of future net income and net revenue growth 
we cannot assure you that our net income or net revenue will grow or be sustained in future periods 
if we cannot sustain net income or operating profitability  we may not be able to meet our debt service or working capital requirements 
these developments could have a material adverse impact on the trading prices of the notes 
integration of acquired businesses 
we strive to increase the volume of voice and data traffic that we carry over our existing global network in order to reduce transmission costs and other operating costs as a percentage of net revenue  improve margins  improve service quality and enhance our ability to introduce new products and services 
during and  to further this growth strategy  we purchased the united states based sme voice customers of c w and made small purchases of businesses and assets to complement our canadian based operations 
future acquisitions may be pursued to further our strategic objectives  including those described above 
acquisitions of businesses and customer lists  a key element of our historical growth strategy  involve operational risks  including the possibility that an acquisition does not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates  completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms  or integrating the acquired business or assets into our own 
there may be difficulty in integrating the service offerings  distribution channels and networks gained through acquisitions with our own 
successful integration of operations and technologies requires the dedication of management and other personnel  which may distract their attention from the day to day business  the development or acquisition of new technologies  and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities  and there can be no assurance that successful integration will occur in light of these factors 
intense competition in local and long distance telecommunications 
the local and long distance telecommunications and data industry is intensely competitive with relatively limited barriers to entry in the more deregulated countries we operate and with numerous entities competing for the same customers 
recent and pending deregulation in various countries may encourage new entrants to compete  including isps  wireless companies  cable television companies and utilities 
for example  the united states and many other countries have committed to open their telecommunications markets to competition pursuant to an agreement under the world trade organization which began on january  further  in the united states  as certain conditions have been met under the telecommunications act of  the rbocs have been allowed to enter the long distance market  at t  mci and other long distance carriers have been allowed to enter the local telephone services market  and any entities  including cable television companies and utilities  have been allowed to enter both the local service and long distance telecommunications markets 
moreover  the rapid enhancement of voip technology may result in increasing levels of traditional domestic and international voice long distance traffic being transmitted over the internet  as opposed to traditional telecommunication networks such as ours 
currently  there are significant cost savings associated with carrying voice traffic employing voip technology  as compared to carrying calls over traditional networks 
thus  there exists the possibility that the price of traditional long distance voice services will decrease in order to be competitive with voip 
additionally  competition is expected to be intense to switch customers to voip product offerings  as is evidenced by numerous recent market announcements in the united states and internationally from industry leaders and competitive carriers concerning significant voip initiatives 
our ability to retain effectively our existing customer base and generate new customers  either through our network or our own voip offerings  may be adversely affected by accelerated competition arising as a result of voip initiatives 
as competition intensifies as a result of deregulatory  market or technological developments  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
pricing pressure 
the long distance telecommunications and data industry is significantly influenced by the marketing and pricing decisions of the larger long distance industry and internet access business participants 
prices in the long distance industry have declined in recent years  and as competition continues to increase within each of our service segments and each of our product lines  we believe that prices are likely to continue to decrease 
our competitors in our core markets include  among others at t  mci  sprint  the rbocs and the major wireless carriers in the united states  telstra  singtel optus and telecom new zealand in australia  telus  bce  callnet allstream formerly at t canada and the major wireless companies in canada  and bt  cable wireless uk  mci  colt telecom  energis and the major wireless carriers in the united kingdom 
customers frequently change long distance providers and isps in response to the offering of lower rates or promotional incentives by competitors 
generally  customers can switch carriers at any time 
competition in all of our markets is likely to remain intense  or even increase in intensity and  as deregulatory influences are experienced in markets outside the united states  competition in non united states markets is likely to become similar to the intense competition in the united states 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  larger networks  a broader portfolio of service offerings  greater control over transmission lines  stronger name recognition and customer loyalty  long standing relationships with our target customers  and lower leverage ratios 
as a result  our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected 
many of our competitors enjoy economies of scale that result in low cost structures for transmission and related costs that could cause significant pricing pressures within the industry 
several long distance carriers in the united states  including most recently  at t  mci  sprint  the rbocs and the major wireless carriers  have introduced pricing and product bundling strategies that provide for fixed  low rates for calls within the united states 
this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our net revenue per minute  results of operations and financial condition if increases in telecommunications usage and potential cost declines do not result from  or are insufficient to offset the effects of  such price decreases 
many companies emerging out of bankruptcy might benefit from a lower cost structure and might apply pricing pressure within the industry to gain market share 
we compete on the basis of price  particularly with respect to our sales to other carriers  and also on the basis of customer service and our ability to provide a variety of telecommunications products and services 
if such price pressures materialize  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on transmission facilities based carriers 
we primarily connect our customers telephone calls through transmission lines that we lease under a variety of arrangements with other facilities based long distance carriers 
many of these carriers are  or may become  our competitors 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with the facilities based carriers from which we lease transmission lines 
if our relationship with one or more of these carriers were to deteriorate or terminate  it could have a material adverse effect upon our cost structure  service quality  network diversity  results of operations and financial condition 
international operations 
we have significant international operations and  as of december   derives more than of our revenues by providing services outside of the united states 
in international markets  we are smaller than the principal or incumbent telecommunications carrier that operates in each of the foreign jurisdictions where we operate 
in these markets  incumbent carriers are likely to control access to  and pricing of  the local networks  enjoy better brand recognition and brand and customer loyalty  and have significant operational economies of scale  including a larger backbone network and more correspondent agreements 
moreover  the incumbent carrier may take many months to allow competitors  including us  to interconnect to its switches within its territory 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for us to operate  obtain access to local transmission facilities on economically acceptable terms  or market services in international markets 
in addition  operating in international markets generally involves additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  restrictions associated with the repatriation of funds  technology export and import restrictions  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
our ability to operate and grow our international operations successfully could be adversely impacted by these risks and uncertainties particularly in light of the fact that we derive such a large percentage of our revenues from outside of the united states 
industry changes 
the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation  privatization  technological improvements  availability of alternative services such as wireless and voip  and the globalization of the world s economies 
in addition  alternative services to traditional fixed wireline services  such as wireless and voip services  are a substantial competitive threat 
if we do not adjust our contemplated plan of development to meet changing market conditions  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements 
achieving successful financial results will depend on our ability to anticipate  assess and adapt to rapid technological changes  and offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  services that meet evolving industry standards 
if we do not anticipate  assess or adapt to such technological changes at a competitive price  maintain competitive services or obtain new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms our financial results may be materially and adversely affected 
network development  migration of traffic 
our long term success depends on our ability to design  implement  operate  manage and maintain a reliable and cost effective network 
in addition  we rely on third parties to enable us to expand and manage our global network 
if we fail to generate additional traffic on our network  if we experience technical or logistical impediments to our ability to migrate traffic onto our network  or if we experience difficulties with our third party providers  we may not achieve desired economies of scale or otherwise be successful in growing our business 
government regulation 
our operations are subject to constantly changing regulation 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us  or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us 
as a multinational telecommunications company  we are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide our services 
local laws and regulations  and the interpretation of such laws and regulations  differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we operate 
enforcement and interpretations of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and are often subject to the informal views of government officials 
recent widespread regulatory changes in the united kingdom and potential future regulatory  judicial  legislative and government policy changes in other jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on us 
domestic or international regulators or third parties may raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations  and therefore may have a material adverse impact on our competitive position  growth and financial performance 
regulatory considerations that affect or limit our business include united states common carrier requirements not to discriminate unreasonably among customers and to charge just and reasonable rates  general uncertainty regarding the future regulatory classification of voip telephony  if regulators decide that voip is a regulated telecommunications service  our voip services may be subject to burdensome regulatory requirements and fees  we may be obligated to pay carriers additional interconnection fees and its operating costs may increase  general changes in access charges  universal service and regulatory fee payments would affect our cost of providing long distance services  and general changes in access charges and contribution payments could adversely affect our cost of providing long distance wireless and other services 
any adverse developments implicating the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  result of operations and prospects 
terrorist attacks 
we are a united states based corporation with significant international operations 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and subsequent worldwide terrorist actions  including apparent action against companies operating abroad  may negatively affect our operations and your investment in us 
we cannot assure you that there will not be further terrorist attacks that impact our employees  network facilities or support systems  either in the united states or in any of the other countries in which we operate 
certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable and others are not likely to be covered by our insurance 
terrorist attacks may directly impact our business operations through damage or harm to our employees  network facilities or support systems  increased security costs or the general curtailment of voice or data traffic 
any of these events could result in increased volatility in or damage to our business and the united states and worldwide financial markets and economies 
they also could result in a continuation of the current economic uncertainty in the united states or abroad  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency currently in excess of of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the usd 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country 
in the future we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs outside the united states  and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the following exchange rates usd aud  usd cad  usd gbp  and usd eur 
due to the large percentage of our operations conducted outside of the united states  strengthening of the usd relative to one or more of the foregoing currencies  could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations 
in addition  the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in foreign countries have been funded with investments and other advances 
historically  such investments and advances have been long term in nature  and we accounted for any adjustments resulting from currency translation as a charge or credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss within the stockholders equity deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
in  agreements with certain subsidiaries were put in place for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to the subsidiaries 
as we anticipate repayment in the foreseeable future of these amounts  we recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
we historically have not engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks 
however  the exposure of our income from operations to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is reduced in part because a majority of the costs that we incur in connection with our foreign operations are also denominated in local currencies 
we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of its international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into usd using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and losses and cash flows and may distort comparisons from year to year 
by way of example  when the usd strengthens compared to the eur  there is a negative effect on our reported results for europe 
it takes greater profits in eur to generate the same amount of profits in stronger usd 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the usd weakens there is a positive effect 
in the year ended december   the usd weakened compared to the aud  cad  gbp and eur 
as a result  our revenue of the subsidiaries whose local currency is aud  cad  gbp and eur increased   and in local currency compared to the year ended december   but increased   and in usd  respectively 
interest rates a substantial majority of our long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as additional financing may be required and certain of our long term obligations are at variable interest rates 
our primary exposure to market risk stems from fluctuations in interest rates 
our interest rate risk related to the variable interest rate on long term obligations results from changes in the united states libor  bloomberg bbswib  united states prime and canada prime rates 
we do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
the interest rate sensitivity table below summarizes our market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates as of december  in usd  which is our reporting currency 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity for our senior notes  convertible senior notes  convertible subordinated debentures  leased fiber capacity  and other long term obligations in effect at december  in the case of the senior notes  convertible senior notes and convertible debentures the table excludes the potential exercise of the relevant redemption and conversion features
