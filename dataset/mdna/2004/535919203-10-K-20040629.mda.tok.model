this order was subsequently renewed and extended such that cin groupe has until july  to file a plan of arrangement with its creditors or to ask the court for another extension to do so

accounting for films and television programs 
in june  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
sop establishes new accounting standards for producers or distributors of films  including changes in revenue recognition  capitalization and amortization of costs of acquiring films and television programs and accounting for exploitation costs  including advertising and marketing expenses 
we elected to adopt sop for canadian gaap purposes 
we capitalize costs of production and acquisition  including financing costs and production overhead  to investment in films and television programs 
these costs are amortized to direct operating expenses in accordance with sop these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized films or television program costs or estimated fair value 
these costs for an individual film or television program are amortized and participation and residual costs are accrued in the proportion that current year s revenues bear to management s estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the year expected to be recognized from exploitation  exhibition or sale of such film or television program over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of initial release 
for previously released film or television programs acquired as part of a library  ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed twenty years from the date of acquisition 
management regularly reviews and revises when necessary  its ultimate revenue and cost estimates  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and or write down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value 
no assurance can be given that unfavorable changes to revenue and cost estimates will not occur  which may result in significant write downs affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale or licensing of films and television programs is recognized upon meeting all recognition requirements of sop revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on the company s participation in box office receipts 
revenue from the sale of videocassettes and digital video disks dvds in the retail market  net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances  is recognized on the later of shipment to the customer or street date when it is available for sale by the customer 
under revenue sharing arrangements  rental revenue is recognized when the company is entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable 
revenues from television licensing are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast 
for television licenses that include separate availability windows during the license period  revenue is allocated over the windows 
revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the distributor for exploitation and no conditions for delivery exist  which under most sales contracts requires that full payment has been received from the distributor 
for multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks  the fee is allocated to the various media based on management s assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released 
for multiple title contracts with a fee  the fee is allocated on a title by title basis  based on management s assessment of the relative fair value of each title 
rental revenue from short term operating leases of studio facilities is recognized over the term of the lease 
until fiscal  the company earned fees from management services provided to canadian limited partnerships  whose purpose is to assist in the financing of films produced in canada 
these fees were recognized as revenue when the financing was completed 
we no longer provide these management services due to the rescission of certain tax shelter provisions by the canadian government 
cash payments received are recorded as deferred revenue until all the conditions of revenue recognition have been met 
long term  non interest bearing receivables are discounted to present value 
reserves 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
we estimate accruals for video returns and other allowances in the consolidated financial statements based on previous returns and our estimated expected future returns related to current period sales and our allowances history on a title by 
table of contents title basis in each of the video businesses 
there may be differences between actual returns and allowances and our historical experience 
we estimate provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience and relevant facts and information regarding the collectability of the accounts receivable 
income taxes 
the company recognizes future income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the financial statements or income tax returns 
future income taxes are provided for using the liability method 
under the liability method  future income taxes are recognized for all significant temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities 
future income tax assets  after deducting valuation allowances  are recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the foreseeable future 
future income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates at the date of substantive enactment 
goodwill 
on april   the company adopted the recommendations of the cica released handbook section  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is similar in many respects to statement of financial accounting standards sfas goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually within each fiscal year or if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company completed impairment tests required under cica and under sfas at april   september  and december  and determined that the recognition of impairment losses was not necessary 
at december   the company completed impairment tests required and it was determined that the implied fair value of goodwill for the animation reporting unit was less than the carrying value of goodwill and therefore animation goodwill was written down by million to nil 
for all other reporting units  it was determined that the recognition of impairment losses was not necessary 
determining the fair value of reporting units requires various assumptions and estimates 
business acquisitions 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions as a purchase  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair value of the net identifiable assets is allocated to goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires various assumptions and estimates
