overview we are a vertically integrated  worldwide provider of security and inspection systems  medical monitoring and imaging systems  and optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems 
our company was incorporated in initially  we manufactured optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems for customers in several industries  including makers of security and inspection systems and medical monitoring and imaging systems 
through acquisitions we have entered the security and medical products markets because we believe that vertical integration make us more competitive in these areas 
we design  manufacture and market security and inspection systems worldwide to end users under trade names including rapiscan  ancore  pnfa  eagle  metor  and secure 
these products are used to inspect people  baggage  cargo  vehicles and other objects for weapons  explosives  drugs and other contraband 
these systems are also used for the safe  accurate and efficient verification of cargo manifests for the purpose of assessing duties and monitoring the export and import of controlled materials 
in the medical field  we design  develop  manufacture  and market patient monitoring products  network connectivity solutions  ambulatory blood pressure monitors  and related services under trade names including spacelabs  ultracare  and ultraview 
we also design  develop  manufacture and market arterial hemoglobin saturation monitors and sensors  including hand held and wireless monitoring tools under trade names including dolphin and nucat  and peripheral bone densitometers under trade names including dtx and dtu one  which are used in the early stage detection or diagnosis of osteoporosis 
our optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems are used in a broad range of applications  including aerospace and defense electronics  security and inspection systems  medical diagnostics  fiber optics  telecommunications  gaming  office automation  computer peripherals and industrial automation 
we design and manufacture optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems for others through original equipment manufacturer arrangements  as well as for our security and medical equipment businesses 
in fiscal year  revenues from the sale of security and inspection products amounted to million  or approximately of our revenues  revenues from the sale of medical monitoring and imaging systems were million or of our revenues  while revenues from the sale of optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems amounted to million  or approximately of our revenues 
we report segment information by geographic area 
we are vertically integrated and our subsidiaries share common resources and facilities 
therefore  with the exception of external revenues  discrete financial information has not historically been available by product line at all operating locations 
as a result of the changes in our structure and operations which have occurred  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we will have discrete financial information available by product line for all operating locations and therefore will begin reporting our segment information by product line 
further information concerning reporting segments is available in note to our financial statements 
our security and inspection systems business continues to grow 
in fiscal year  this growth occurred despite the completion during the first quarter of our contract to manufacture pre scanners and related electronics for invision technologies  inc s ctx products 
the invision technologies  inc contract contributed approximately million to our sales in fiscal year including approximately million to our security and inspection side of our business compared to approximately  in fiscal year we substantially offset this decrease in revenues with growth in both domestic and international sales of our conventional parcel security and our cargo inspection products 
as part of our security and inspection systems growth strategy  we continue to invest in acquisitions to broaden our technology and product portfolio 
in january  we completed the acquisition of advanced research applications corp 
aracor  a privately held company based in sunnyvale  california for approximately million net of cash acquired 
during seven years following the close  contingent consideration is payable to aracor s former shareholders based on aracor s net revenues  provided certain requirements are met 
the contingent consideration is capped at million 
aracor s eagle product is a large  x ray based scanning system for inspecting containers at busy seaports 
the eagle was designed in partnership with us customs and us customs has issued a blanket purchase order for up to million over the next years 
including options exercised by us customs as well as other orders  aracor has to date received orders totaling approximately million for the eagle 
in december  we acquired substantially all the assets of j d engineering uk  limited  a company registered in england and wales for approximately  this acquisition has provided us with the ability to design and manufacture metal frames for our x ray machines and other products 
in june  we increased our investment in cxr limited  a uk based research and development venture that develops real time tomography systems  to approximately million including a million loan 
as a result of our additional equity investment  we now own approximately of cxr limited 
as a result of these and other developments  we continue to believe that our security and inspection systems business offers a broad product line in the conventional and cargo security business  including x ray  gamma ray and neutron technologies and hybrid products built on these technologies and we continue to invest in our research and development for our security and inspection business 
in march  we significantly enhanced our medical monitoring and imaging systems activities through the acquisition of spacelabs medical inc spacelabs medical  a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring and clinical information systems for use primarily in hospitals 
spacelabs medical s principal products encompass patient monitoring systems  network and connectivity solutions  ambulatory blood pressure monitors and medical data services 
we completed the acquisition of spacelabs medical from instrumentarium corporation for approximately million in cash net of cash acquired  including acquisition costs 
the final purchase price is subject to certain working capital adjustments 
in june  we notified instrumentarium corporation s parent  ge medical systems  of a working capital and retention bonus adjustments resulting in what we believe to be a downward adjustment of the purchase price in the amount of million 
in september  ge medical systems responded that it believes the amount of the downward adjustment to be approximately million 
no amounts have been recorded in the financial statements in relation to the expected reduction in the purchase price 
the amount of the final adjustment will be resolved by way of a process established in the purchase agreement 
therefore  the final purchase price and the purchase price allocation may differ significantly from the preliminary estimates of these amounts 
our other medical monitoring and imaging products are experiencing sales growth  especially our pulse oximetry products which compete directly with the products of nellcor 
in fiscal year  we granted conmed corporation exclusive marketing and distribution rights to certain dolphin medical products in the united states and other territories for a period of five years 
these products are receiving considerable interest as we have begun to introduce them in the united states and other countries worldwide where key nellcor patents have recently expired 
we also sold a interest in our dolphin medical subsidiary to conmed corporation and granted an option to conmed corporation to purchase the remaining shares of dolphin medical 
we received proceeds of million related to the sale of the interest  the grant of the option  and the grant of marketing and distribution rights to conmed corporation 
our optoelectronic devices and subsystems product sales have weakened in certain areas 
the growth that did occur in this area of our business was due to strategic acquisitions 
in august  we purchased the military  laser based training business of schwartz electro optics  inc for million 
we believe the products lines we acquired from this company  now sold by our newly formed osi defense systems  llc osi defense systems subsidiary  complement the defense product lines of our existing rapitec  inc rapitec subsidiary 
both osi defense systems and rapitec develop  manufacture  market  and sell tactical engagement simulation systems  man worn laser detectors  small arms transmitters  controller guns and a variety of targeting systems for the defense industry 
in october  we acquired the assets of a manufacturing services company specializing in surface mount technology lines and pc board assembly operations for approximately million 
the business  now operating as osi electronics  inc osi electronics  has begun to provide our optoelectronic devices and subsystems group with increased manufacturing capacity and technologies to support internal needs as well as to offer a broad manufacturing platform to our existing customers 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the remaining assets from schwartz electro optics  inc  for approximately million 
the acquired assets consist of a business that designs  manufactures  markets and sells laser based systems used in traffic and toll management  precision agricultural management  and precision mapping and surveying 
this business now operates under the name osi laserscan and offers  among other products  a unique  patented laser range finder technology  which is gaining acceptance by traffic and toll management authorities  as well as precision agricultural management  mapping  and survey technologies 
overall as a company  we continue to move towards the consolidation of our various businesses 
we do so in order to generate manufacturing  sales force  and administrative related efficiencies and to increase productivity 
we also continue to invest in critical areas such as sales  marketing  and research and development 
our gross margin is dependent on our product mix 
with the inclusion of spacelabs medical revenues  our gross margin as a percentage of revenues has increased  however  our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues have also increased as spacelabs medical has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
our gross margin as a percentage of revenues is also offset by the inclusion of the results of osi electronics  a manufacturing service company which operates in an area where gross margins are traditionally low 
we engage in significant international operations 
we currently manufacture our security and inspection products at our facilities in hawthorne  santa clara  sunnyvale  california  and internationally in canada  finland  malaysia  singapore and the united kingdom 
our medical monitoring and imaging systems are currently manufactured at our facilities in hawthorne  california  and issaquah  washington and internationally in india  malaysia  and singapore

revenues from shipments made outside of the united states accounted for of revenues in fiscal year  of revenues in fiscal year  and of revenues in fiscal year information regarding our operating income or loss and identifiable assets attributable to each of our geographic areas is set forth in note in our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions in  we  together with an unrelated company  formed ecil rapiscan security products limited  a joint venture organized under the laws of india 
we own a interest in the joint venture  our chairman and chief executive officer owns a interest  and the president of our security and inspection products group owns a ownership interest 
our initial investment was  for the year ended june   our equity earnings in the joint venture amounted to  for the year ended june  they amounted to  and for the year ended june  they amounted to  and are included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
during the year ended june   we increased our initial investment by  our ownership interest remained at as all the shareholders increased their respective investments proportionately 
we  our chairman and chief executive officer  and the president of our security and inspection products group collectively control less than of the board of directors voting power in the joint venture 
as a result  we account for the investment under the equity method of accounting 
the joint venture was formed for the purpose of the manufacture  assembly  service  and testing of x ray security and other products 
some of our subsidiaries are suppliers to the joint venture partner  which in turn manufactures and sells the resulting products utilizing technology received from the subsidiary 
the joint venture agreement provides for technology transfers between us and the joint venture  subject to certain restrictions 
during the year ended june   we earned a technical fee from the joint venture in the amount of  we did not earn any technical fee during the years ended june  and  as the technical agreement has expired 
we contracted with entities owned by members of our board of directors to provide messenger service  auto rental and printing services 
included in cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended june   and are approximately   and  for messenger service and auto rental  and   and  for printing services  and   and for professional services  respectively 
we contracted during fiscal year for professional services of  from a firm that has a partner serving as a member of our board of directors 
we have discontinued the contract for professional services from that firm 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products when title and risk of loss passes  and when terms are fixed and collection is probable 
in accordance with the terms of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  where installation services  if provided  are essential to the functionality of the equipment  the portion of revenue for the sale attributable to installation is deferred and recognized when the installation services are provided 
in an instance where terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
concurrent with the shipment of the product  we accrue estimated product return reserves and warranty expenses 
critical judgments made by management related to revenue recognition include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
we undertake projects that include the development and construction of large complex cargo inspection systems requiring installation and customization at the customer s site 
sales under such long term contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
costs and estimated revenues are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
critical estimates made by management related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method include the estimation of costs at completion and the determination of the overall margin rate on the specific project 
revenues from separate service maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
for other services  service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue for services arises from advance payments received from customers for services not yet performed 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and current credit worthiness  as determined by credit information available at that time 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on assessments of future demands for the next to months  market conditions and customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties 
if these factors are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available evidence and other factors  that we will not realize some portion or all of our deferred tax assets 
we base our determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of past and current evidence including  among other things  historical earnings  estimates of future earnings  the backlog of customer orders and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
we charge or credit adjustments to the valuation allowance to income tax expense in the period in which these determinations are made 
if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period this determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce net income and would establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset in the period this determination was made 
goodwill 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if events occur or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
this assessment requires the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units on the income approach which requires the use of estimates of future revenues  cash flows  and capital expenditures as well as market trends and growth 
we believe these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates

fin requires that variable interest entities be consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding a variable interest 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  which made certain amendments to fin the provisions of fin r are effective for the first interim or annual period ending after march  when certain conditions are met by a variable interest entity 
we have adopted fin r and have consolidated in our financial statements our investment in cxr limited  which was previously accounted for under the equity method 
the results and operations of this venture are not material to our financial position or results of operations 
creditors and other investors in the venture do not have any recourse to us

the provisions of eitf issue no

 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired to be applied in reporting periods beginning after june  and contains disclosure requirements effective in annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  for investments accounted for under sfas nos

did not have a material effect on our financial position or result of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce market risk in connection with specific foreign currency denominated transactions 
we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our short term borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
borrowings under these lines of credit do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings have short maturities and are borrowed at variable interest rates 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes 
foreign currency we maintain the accounts of our operations in canada  india  malaysia  norway  singapore  and the united kingdom in canadian dollars  indian rupees  malaysian ringgits  norwegian kroners  singapore dollars  and uk pounds  respectively 
we maintain the accounts of our operations in austria  finland  france  germany  and greece in euros 
foreign currency financial statements are translated into us dollars at current rates  with the exception of revenues  costs and expenses  which are translated at average rates during the reporting period 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income  while those resulting from translation of financial statements are excluded from income and accumulated as a component of shareholder s equity 
we included transaction losses of approximately  in income for fiscal year and  in fiscal year a hypothetical change in the relevant currency rates at june   would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
our use of derivatives consists primarily of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
we purchase forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposure related to commitments to acquire inventory for sale 
we do not use the contracts for trading purposes 
as of june   there were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
as of june   we had one foreign exchange contract with a notional amount of million to hedge foreign exchange exposure on accounts receivable and accounts payable 
importance of international markets international markets provide us with significant growth opportunities 
however  the following events  among others  could adversely affect our financial results in subsequent periods periodic economic downturns in different regions of the world  changes in trade policies or tariffs  and political instability 
for the year ended june   overall foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar had an immaterial effect on our consolidated revenues and results of operations 
as a result of monetary policy in malaysia  including the pegging of the malaysian ringgit to the us dollar  we believe that our foreign currency exposure in malaysia will not be significant in the foreseeable future 
we continue to perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and  if deemed necessary  we require advance payments for sales 
we monitor economic and currency conditions around the world to evaluate whether there may be any significant effect on our international sales in the future 
due to our overseas investments and the necessity of dealing with local currencies in our foreign business transactions  we are at risk with respect to foreign currency fluctuations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations 
interest rate risk all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalent and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
short term investments are comprised of high quality marketable securities 
we have not historically used derivatives to hedge our interest rate risk 
however  during the fiscal year we entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our variable interest rate debt to a fixed rate liability 
as of june   all interest rate swaps had expired 
the fair value of the swaps was  as of june  the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of june  are as follows carrying amount maturity fair value investments cash and cash equivalents average interest rate long term debt secured long term loan average interest rate the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of june  are as follows carrying amount maturity fair value investments cash and cash equivalents average interest rate long term debt secured long term loan average interest rate risk factors investing in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk 
investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this report or incorporated by reference 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer  in which case the trading price of our common stock may decline 
risks related to our business fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results 
factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business  adverse changes in industries  such as semiconductors and electronics  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the portions of our revenue represented by various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations by our competitors  variations in our product mix  the timing and amount of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
we face aggressive competition in many areas of business 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business 
in the security and inspection and medical monitoring and imaging systems markets  competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance  functionality and quality  cost  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  price  certification by government authorities  local market presence  and breadth of sales and service organization 
in the optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems market competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices  product quality  timeliness of delivery  price  customer technical support  and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through volume subsystem production 
we may not be able to compete effectively with all of our competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and enhance our existing products in a timely manner 
we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
the september  terrorist attacks and the creation of the us department of homeland security have increased financial expectations that may not materialize 
the september  terrorist attacks and the subsequent creation of the us department of homeland security have created increased interest in our security and detection products  however  we are not certain whether the level of demand will continue to be as high as anticipated 
we do not know what solutions will continue to be adopted by the us department of homeland security as a result of the terrorism and whether our products will be a part of the solution 
additionally  should our products be considered as a part of the future security solution  it is unclear what the level may be and how quickly funding to purchase our products may be made available 
these factors may adversely impact us and create unpredictability in revenues and operating results 
our revenues are dependent on orders in the security and inspection products  which have lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles 
sales of security and inspection products depend in significant part upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports  border crossing inspection sites  seaport inspection sites  and other security installations 
accordingly  a portion of our sales of security inspection and detection products is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that typically accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  we expend significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if we fail to receive an order after expending such resources  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer 
we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
some of our products are used by our customers to develop  test  and manufacture their products 
we therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing any new product  we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues 
interruptions in our ability to purchase raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability 
we purchase certain raw materials and subcomponents from third parties pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
purchase order terms range from three months to one year at fixed costs  but we do not have guaranteed long term supply arrangements with our suppliers 
any material interruption in our ability to purchase necessary raw materials or subcomponents could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy  integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or make acquired businesses profitable 
one of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our management  working capital  and financial resources 
we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons  including competition among buyers  the need for regulatory approvals  including antitrust approvals  and the high valuations of businesses 
some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  we must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 
to finance our acquisitions  we may have to raise additional funds  through either public or private financings 
we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms 
our acquisition and alliance activities could disrupt our ongoing business 
we intend to continue to make investments in companies  products  and technologies  either through acquisitions or investments or alliances 
for example  we completed the acquisition of spacelabs medical this past year  a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring and clinical information systems for use primarily in hospitals 
acquisitions and alliance activities often involve risks  including i difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees  ii difficulty in managing product co development activities with our alliance partners  iii retaining the key employees of the acquired operation  iv disruption of our ongoing business  v inability to successfully integrate the acquired technologies and operations into our businesses and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies  and procedures  and vi lacking the experience necessary to enter into new product or technology markets 
in addition  from time to time  our competitors acquire or enter into exclusive arrangements with companies with whom we do business or may do business in the future 
reductions in the number of partners with whom we may do business in a particular context may reduce our ability to enter into critical alliances on attractive terms or at all  and the termination of an existing alliance by a business partner may disrupt our operations 
economic  political  and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales 
in fiscal year revenues from shipments made outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year of the revenues generated during fiscal year from shipments made to customers outside of the united states  represented sales from the us to foreign customers  and the balance represented sales generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
since we sell our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenues from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities  employees and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 
our failure to protect our intellectual property could impair our competitive position 
while we own certain patents and trademarks  some aspects of our business cannot be protected by patents or trademarks 
accordingly  in these areas there are few legal barriers that prevent potential competitors from copying certain of our products  processes  and technologies or from otherwise entering into operations in direct competition with us 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  and resulting claims against us could be costly and prevent us from making or selling certain products 
third parties may seek to claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties 
in addition  claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from making  using or selling our products in the us or abroad 
a claim for damages could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  particularly with respect to our security and inspection products 
there are many factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims  including the failure of the products in which our subsystems are installed  the reliability of the customers operators of the inspection equipment  and the maintenance of the inspection units by the customers 
there can be no assurance that the amount of product liability insurance that we carry will be sufficient to protect us from product liability claims 
a product liability claim in excess of the amount of insurance we carry could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees 
we are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees  many of whom are individually key to our current and future success  and the availability of new employees to implement our growth plans 
in particular  we are dependent upon the services of deepak chopra  our chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer 
we have entered into a year employment agreement with mr 
chopra  which expires april  and we maintain a million policy of key man life insurance on the life of mr 
chopra 
the market for skilled employees is highly competitive  especially for employees in technical fields 
while our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for it to be successful  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute on our plans  nor can there be any assurances that we will be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations may create significant environmental liabilities and force us to modify our manufacturing processes 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
under such laws  we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or wastes that have been or are being disposed of offsite as wastes or that have been or are being released on or in our facilities 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or caused  the release of such hazardous substances or wastes 
any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes  or cessation of operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal  state  local  and foreign regulations  such as environmental  health  safety  and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure  and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products 
risks related to our capital structure and common stock our articles of incorporation and other agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock  to fix the number of shares constituting any such series  and to fix the designation of any such series  without further vote or action by shareholders 
the terms of any series of preferred stock  which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights  could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock and thereby reduce the value of our common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock  coupled with the concentration of ownership in the directors and executive officers  could discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of our company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices  otherwise dilute the rights of holders of common stock  and may limit the ability of such shareholders to cause or approve transactions which they may deem to be in their best interests  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have in place a stockholder rights plan  adopted in  under which our stockholders are entitled to purchase shares of preferred stock under certain circumstances 
these circumstances include the purchase of or more of the outstanding shares of common stock by a person or group  or the announcement of a tender or exchange offer to acquire or more of the outstanding common stock 
the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of our company that could be beneficial to the stockholders 
our articles of incorporation limit the liability of its directors  which may limit the remedies we or our shareholders have available 
our articles of incorporation provide that  pursuant to the california corporations code  the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under california law 
this is intended to eliminate the personal liability of a director for monetary damages in an action brought by us  or in our right  for breach of a director s duties to us or our shareholders and may limit the remedies available to us or our shareholders 
this provision does not eliminate the directors fiduciary duty and does not apply to liabilities for i acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law  ii acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of our company or our shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director  iii any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit  iv acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director s duty to the our company or our shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware  or should have been aware  in the ordinary course of performing a director s duties  of a risk of serious injury to our company or our shareholders  v acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director s duty to our company or our shareholders  vi certain transactions or the approval of transactions in which a director has a material financial interest  and vii expressly imposed by statute for approval of certain improper distributions to shareholders or certain loans or guarantees
