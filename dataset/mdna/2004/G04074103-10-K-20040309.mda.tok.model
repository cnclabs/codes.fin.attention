item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of apex silver mines limited and the selected financial data and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
apex limited is a mining exploration and development company that holds a portfolio of silver exploration and development properties primarily in south america  mexico  central america and central asia 
we currently focus our resources primarily on the development and financing of our san cristobal project in bolivia 
at present  none of our properties is in production and  consequently  we have no current operating income or cash flow 
we completed an initial public offering of our ordinary shares on december  we completed a subsequent offering of ordinary shares and warrants during november during january and february we completed additional subsequent offerings totaling million ordinary shares resulting in gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million after commissions and fees 
the offerings were completed at an average offering price of per share and substantially completed the sale of securities available under our shelf registrations filed with the securities and exchange commission 
overview during the first half of  metals prices and capital market conditions remained at levels that we deemed unattractive for the development of san cristobal 
as a result  we kept exploration and administrative costs at levels below those of the previous two years 
interest income fell from the level earned in  because capital market interest rates fell 
trading income improved  mainly due to the effect of higher metals prices on the small amount of silver and zinc that we had bought 
as metals prices rose late in and into the early part of  we found the market conditions improving and as a result  were able to successfully complete the above noted equity offerings in early during  we anticipate working with our lead arranger for project financing  barclays capital  and other financial organizations to advance the financing for san cristobal 
during  we anticipate completing most of the remaining engineering required to develop san cristobal 
results of operations interest and other income 
our interest and other income for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income compared to is primarily the result of lower interest rates during the decrease in interest and other income for compared to was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates during as compared to trading gains and losses 
we recorded a trading gain for the year ended of approximately million compared to trading losses of approximately million for and million for the improvement in as compared to is primarily the result of rising silver and zinc prices  and to a lesser extent  rising lead prices during the improvement in of a million loss as compared to the million loss in is primarily the result of a smaller deterioration in the value of our long position in zinc during inception to date  we have recorded a gain of approximately million related to the trading program 
that amount represents approximately million of cash gains partially offset by million of unrealized losses at december  under fas  fair value measurements may vary substantially from period to period based on spot prices  forward prices and quoted option volatilities 
exploration 
our exploration expenses  including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses  were million for the year ended december   including million value of ordinary shares issued to consultants  as compared to million  including million value of ordinary shares issued to acquire mineral rights  for the year ended december   and million  including million value of ordinary shares issued to acquire mineral rights for the year ended december  the decreases in our exploration expenses since were due primarily to the increased emphasis on conserving our cash balances 
administrative 
our administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our administrative expenses since is primarily the result of cost savings associated with the reduction of personnel and office facilities as part of our cash conserving policy 
in addition  the  and expenses include million  million and million respectively  for the value of stock  options and warrants issued to consultants in lieu of cash 
income taxes 
apex silver mines corporation  our us management services company  is subject to us income taxes 
otherwise we pay no income tax in the us since we are incorporated in the cayman islands and do not conduct or expect to conduct business in the us that would generate us taxable income 
the cayman islands currently impose no corporate taxation 
we have been granted an exemption until january  from any form of corporate taxation that may subsequently be adopted in the cayman islands 
deferred tax assets of approximately million at december   resulting from operating loss carry forwards of our subsidiaries  have been entirely offset by valuation allowances 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents during is the result of million capitalized to property  plant and equipment related to the development of the san cristobal project  million used to fund operations  property holding costs and administrative costs  net of interest and other income  partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of our stock options by certain employees  consultants and a former director 
pursuant to two universal shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission  we sold million ordinary shares during january and february the sales resulted in gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million after commissions and fees 
the offerings were completed at a weighted average offering price of per share and the offerings substantially complete the sale of the securities available under these registration statements 
proceeds from the offerings will be used to finance a portion of the construction and development of san cristobal  advance evaluation of exploration properties and for general corporate purposes 
if metals and capital markets remain at levels that will allow us to do so  we intend to substantially complete the financing requirements for our san cristobal project in the next twelve months 
we continue to work with our lead arranger for project financing  barclays capital  as well as several multilateral agencies  to develop financing options for san cristobal as part of a total financing package that may incorporate support from other official agencies as well as debt financing from banks and the use of capital markets 
we have spent approximately million on construction costs through december  and have expended approximately million in total project capital on san cristobal to date 
based on estimated revisions made during to the september feasibility study for the san cristobal project  which assumes contract mining  we forecast remaining capital costs for construction to total approximately million net of approximately million in expected tax credits  including approximately million which will be recovered against our future bolivian income taxes after commencement of production 
we expect to complete detailed engineering during and incorporate into our feasibility study any changes deriving from our ultimate infrastructure arrangements  which may result in increases to our forecasted construction capital and working capital requirements 
there can be no assurance that metals or capital markets will maintain their recently improved state or that we will be able to obtain the required remaining financing on terms that we find attractive  or at all 
during the next twelve months we expect to spend up to million on infrastructure development  engineering and other costs related to our san cristobal project 
in addition  in order to maintain our current portfolio of mineral properties  we expect to make lease  patent and option payments during the next twelve months of about million 
there also is likely to be some discretionary spending on attractive exploration opportunities as they arise 
total administrative expenses are not expected to exceed million during  net of interest and other income 
we plan to fund our project and operating expenditures for the next twelve months from our existing cash balances 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
table of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years thereafter thousands debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other gaap liabilities from time to time we enter into lease option agreements related to exploration properties that are of interest to us 
these agreements normally contain escalating lease payments required to maintain our exploration rights to the property 
such agreements are not included in the above table because exploration success is historically low and the agreements can be terminated by us at any time 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
we expect to be able to comply with those laws and does not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with best contemporary industry practice 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have changed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
you should also read note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements are affected by estimates that we  or experts that we have retained  have made as to our proven and probable reserves 
reserve estimates involve subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions that may later prove to be inaccurate 
these estimates include engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  changes in the market prices of metals may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect ore reserves 
our current proven and probable reserve estimates at san cristobal  total approximately million tonnes of ore grading grams per tonne of silver  zinc and lead 
these reserves contain approximately million ounces of silver  billion pounds of zinc and billion pounds of lead 
the reserves are based on per ounce silver  per pound zinc and per pound lead 
these prices represent the three year average prices for each of the metals as per guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission 
to complete the project financing on san cristobal  we may be required to hedge a portion of our planned production 
in addition  when san cristobal enters production  we may sell forward a portion of our production and use price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating metals prices 
we currently engage in limited metals trading activities utilizing puts and calls and other market instruments in anticipation of potential lender requirements for the san cristobal project financing 
we measure the fair value of open positions at each reporting period and record the difference in the carrying value to current earnings  in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
under fas  fair value measurements may vary substantially from period to period based on spot prices  forward prices and quoted option volatilities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  our major principal cash balances are held in us dollars 
we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and therefore have a relative low exposure to currency fluctuations 
because we conduct our activities in several foreign countries  we may in the future engage in hedging activities to minimize the risk of exposure to currency and interest rate fluctuations 
to complete the project financing for san cristobal  we expect to be required to hedge a portion of our planned production 
in addition  when san cristobal enters production  we may sell forward a portion of our production and use price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating metals prices 
we currently engage in limited metals trading activities  utilizing puts and calls and other market instruments in anticipation of potential lender requirements for the san cristobal project financing
