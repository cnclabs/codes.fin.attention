current developments fair and accurate credit transactions act of in december  president bush signed the fair and accurate credit transactions act of  or facta  into law amending the fair credit reporting act  or fcra 
facta makes the state law pre emption provisions of the fcra permanent  so we  and our customers  can continue to operate uniformly nationally 
among other things  facta requires us also on an annual basis to provide free credit reports to consumers upon request 
in developing the implementation rules that will be issued during this year  we are working closely with the federal trade commission  or ftc 
the effective date for the free report requirement is december as the ftc rules are finalized  we will be better able to quantify the cost of compliance 
in anticipation  we are taking substantive action to determine ways to offset these costs  including cost reductions  offsets and realization on additional marketing opportunities caused by heightened consumer awareness 
acquisition of smaller affiliates and companies in  we continued the strategy of growing our credit data franchise through the acquisition of affiliates 
during the months of  we acquired the credit files  contractual rights to territories  and customer relationships and related businesses of four independent credit reporting agencies in the united states and one in canada  all of which house consumer information on our system 
additionally  in april  we completed the purchase of a small emarketing business for million 
we acquired all of these businesses for million primarily in cash  allocating million of the purchase price to goodwill  million to purchased data files  and million to non compete agreements 
the results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition  and have not been material 
emarketing services during  we renamed naviant  equifax emarketing solutions  inc restructured the products and services that it offers and completed consolidation into direct marketing services 
provided many challenges for our emarketing services business 
during the year  emarketing experienced difficulty in aligning operations with revenue 
in the second and third quarters of we described the extent of these difficulties and the actions we were taking to restructure and reposition the business 
in the fourth quarter of  after efforts to right size our emarketing business by reducing headcount and eliminating certain products  we determined  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of how we review assets for impairment in our business environment  that certain of our amortizable intangible assets  fixed assets  and indefinite lived assets of our emarketing business were impaired 
as described in our discussion in note  we wrote down the identifiable assets of our emarketing business to their estimated remaining fair value 
the total asset impairment charge for emarketing assets totaled million  leaving assets  excluding goodwill  of million  of which million is for trade accounts receivable  net of a million allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  we further reduced headcount  consolidated multiple locations  and consolidated eliminated products with limited growth  resulting in restructuring charges of million  also for the emarketing business 
to make the operating environment even more challenging  the emarketing products and services were negatively impacted by increased business and legislative pressure to significantly reduce or eliminate spam 
in december  president bush signed the can spam act which is the first anti spam legislation passed by the us congress 
it is anticipated that this legislation will benefit the deliverability of consumer requested email  which is the basis of our emarketing services 
additionally  this legislative action should remove some uncertainty concerning federal government actions that existed during we believe that the asset write downs  personnel reductions  facility consolidations and federal spam legislation allow for an efficient operating structure for future periods 
on december   we and naviant served a demand for arbitration alleging  among other things  that the shareholder sellers of naviant had breached various warranties and representations concerning information furnished to us in connection with the acquisition

the arbitration is in its early stages and the issues have not yet been joined 
we cannot predict at this time the probable outcome of this matter

in december  we began discussions with a new prospective buyer that in january agreed to purchase the business 
during  the commercial business in spain was written down an additional million to reflect the impact of the offer on the carrying value of the discontinued operations 
we have reviewed the terms and conditions of this contract to purchase the business  and have concluded that the december   provision for the estimated loss on disposal is adequate
