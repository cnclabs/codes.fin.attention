item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements  including the related notes  presented in this annual report on form k 
executive summary cephalon is an international biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and marketing of innovative products to treat sleep disorders  neurological disorders  cancer and pain 
in addition to conducting an active research and development program  we market three products in the united states and numerous products in various countries throughout europe 
our three biggest products in terms of product sales  provigil  actiq and gabitril  comprised approximately of our worldwide net sales for the year ended december  we market provigil  actiq and gabitril in the united states through our approximately person sales force 
our corporate and research and development headquarters are in west chester  pennsylvania  and we have offices in salt lake city  utah  france  the united kingdom  germany and switzerland 
we operate manufacturing facilities in france for the production of modafinil  which is the active drug substance in provigil  and salt lake city  utah  for the production of actiq for worldwide distribution and sale 
on november   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with cima labs inc 
cima 
pursuant to this agreement  we will acquire cima  and each outstanding share of cima common stock will be converted into the right to receive per share in cash 
the total value of the transaction is approximately million  net of cima s cash and cash equivalents as of december  the completion of the transaction is subject to several conditions  including the approval of the merger by the stockholders of cima and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of hsr act 
on january   we announced that we had received a request for additional information from the federal trade commission as part of its review of the transaction under the hsr act 
this request extends the waiting period under the hsr act during which the ftc is permitted to review the proposed transaction 
we expect the merger will be completed in the second quarter of as part of our business strategy in the future  we expect to consider and  as appropriate  consummate acquisitions of other technologies  products and businesses 
our future success is highly dependent on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our products and technology 
with respect to provigil  we have filed a patent infringement suit against four generic companies 
depending on the results of this litigation  we could face generic competition as early as december for actiq  the patents covering the previous and current formulations are set to expire as early as may and september  respectively 
the loss of patent protection on any of our existing products  whether by third party challenge  invalidation or circumvention or by patent expiration  would materially impact our results of operations 
over the past few years  we have pursued a strategy of both broadening the range of clinical uses that are approved by regulatory authorities and seeking new and improved formulations of our currently marketed products 
our efforts resulted in fda approval in january of an expanded label for provigil and will continue in as we conduct phase clinical trials of provigil in adhd and nuvigil in narcolepsy  osa hs and swsd and phase studies of gabitril in generalized anxiety disorder  post traumatic stress disorder and insomnia 
we also expect to initiate in clinical development of a sugar free formulation of actiq 
we also have devoted significant resources to the development of therapeutics to treat neurological and oncological disorders 
in the neurology area  we have a program with a molecule  cep  that has entered into an patient phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with early stage parkinson s disease 
in the cancer area  we have a program with a molecule  cep  and are currently enrolling patients for phase clinical trials in patients suffering from prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia aml and a phase program with another molecule  cep  to evaluate safety and tolerability in patients with treatment refractory tumors 
in the pharmaceutical industry  the regulatory approval for the sale of new pharmaceutical products remains highly uncertain because the majority of therapeutic candidates fail to show the human safety and efficacy necessary for regulatory approval and successful commercialization 
in addition  these efforts require substantial time  effort and financial resources 
our success in developing and commercializing these product candidates  or new or improved formulations of existing products  will be a significant factor in our future success 
we have significant levels of indebtedness outstanding  the majority of which consists of convertible notes with stated conversion prices or restricted conversion prices higher than our stock price as of the date of this filing 
of our outstanding convertible notes  million matures in the rate of our future growth and our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations necessary to service and repay our indebtedness ultimately will depend  in large part  on our ability to maintain patent protection on our existing products and successfully acquire or develop new products 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december  change change sales provigil    actiq    gabitril    other    total sales    total other revenues total revenues certain sales amounts for the year ended december  have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
revenues total sales in increased over total sales in the increase is attributable to a number of factors including sales of provigil increased in as compared to the increase was the net result of strong us demand for provigil as indicated by a increase in prescriptions  according to ims health  driven by an expansion of both our sales force and marketing efforts  and by weighted average domestic price increases of approximately 
while applicable laws and regulations prevent us from promoting our products for uses beyond those contained in the approved label  our analysis of prescription data for provigil in the united states indicated a considerable portion of the increase in prescriptions is due to the fact that some physicians have elected to prescribe the product to treat excessive sleepiness and fatigue outside of narcolepsy 
sales in also increased relative to as a result of the depletion in and early of inventory levels at certain wholesalers 
additionally  international sales of provigil increased during due to the impact of recording a full calendar year of sales in in certain european countries to which product rights had been acquired in  and also due to the favorable translation impact resulting from a strengthening euro and uk pound versus the uk dollar 
sales of actiq increased in as compared to the same period last year 
this increase was due  in part  to an expansion of our sales force in and continued  focused marketing efforts to pain specialists as indicated by an increase in us prescriptions  according to ims health 
domestic weighted average price increases of approximately also contributed to higher sales recorded in sales of gabitril increased in as compared to the same period last year  as indicated by a increase in us prescriptions  according to ims health 
while applicable laws and regulations prevent us from promoting our products for uses beyond those contained in the approved label  our analysis of prescription data for gabitril in the united states indicated a considerable portion of the increase in prescriptions is due to the fact that some physicians have elected to explore new uses for gabitril including anxiety  insomnia  and neuropathic pain 
weighted average increases in domestic prices of approximately also contributed to higher sales recorded in other sales consist primarily of sales of other products and certain third party products in various international markets  principally in france 
the most significant sales in this category are spasfon phloroglucinol and fonzylane buflomedil 
while other sales denominated in foreign currencies remained relatively flat from year to year  a strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar in contributed to increased equivalent sales denominated in us dollars 
total other revenues in and is mainly comprised of revenue recognized under collaborative agreements 
the decrease of from period to period is primarily due to lower clinical research related expenditures on our cep program combined with a decrease in the contractually stated reimbursement rate  partially offset by increased expenditures on our cep program 
the level of other revenue recognized from period to period may continue to fluctuate based on the status and activity of each related project and terms of each collaboration agreement 
therefore  past levels of other revenues may not be indicative of future levels 
for the year ended december  change change costs and expenses cost of sales    research and development    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    cost of sales the cost of sales was approximately of net sales for and of net sales for the decrease is due to cost savings realized from our transfer of us actiq manufacturing from abbott laboratories to our salt lake city facility beginning in june and to higher than normal gabitril inventory costs recorded in associated with our acquisition of gabitril product rights in territories other than the united states 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  in as compared to approximately million of this increase is due to costs associated with additional clinical studies conducted in to explore the utility of gabitril beyond its current indication  increased expenditures associated with the ongoing phase study of cep in parkinson s disease  and costs incurred with phase and phase studies of nuvigil 
research and development expenses incurred by our cephalon france subsidiary increased million primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro as compared to the us dollar 
additionally  in  we recorded a million charge relating to the write off as r d expense of the value of an investment in an unaffiliated entity 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenditures in primarily associated with the conclusion of clinical studies of provigil in shift work sleep disorder and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder of million and by a decrease in expenditures of million related predominantly to producing clinical supplies in for our phase studies of cep in collaboration with sanofi synth labo 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to sales and marketing costs increased million in the us as a result of the expansion of our field sales forces  additional product promotional expenses and an increased number of medical education programs 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to  of which million is attributable to amortization in associated with the october acquisition of actiq marketing rights in certain countries 
depreciation expenses increased by million in  in part  as a result of increased capital spending on capitalized software and building improvements at our west chester location 
additionally  during  the estimated useful life of certain building improvements was changed from years to years  resulting in an increase of million in depreciation expense 
for the year ended december  change change other income and expense interest income    interest expense    charge on early extinguishment of debt    other income expense  net    other income and expense total other expenses  net  decreased million  or  in from due to interest income decreased by million in due to lower investment returns partially offset by higher average investment balances 
interest expense decreased by million due to a decrease in interest expense of million associated with the march termination of our joint venture  a decrease in interest and amortization expense of million associated with the july redemption of our convertible subordinated notes  a decrease in interest expense of million on our convertible subordinated notes as a result of the interest rate swap agreement in effect for million of the outstanding million balance  partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of million associated with debt issuance costs from our june sale of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes 
in  we recognized a charge of million resulting from our purchase of the class a investors interests in a joint venture 
this charge consisted of a write off of million of the remaining capitalized costs associated with the formation of the joint venture and a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
in  we recognized a charge of million associated with the redemption of the outstanding balance of convertible subordinated notes and the july repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes 
other income increased in by million primarily due to the effect of foreign currency gains from the termination of the australian dollar hedge related to our sirtex bid 
this gain was offset by foreign currency losses recorded by our european subsidiaries related to the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
for the year ended december  change change income tax expense benefit  net    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  income tax expense benefit  net we recognized million of income tax expense in based on an overall estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 
this includes million of additional valuation allowance attributable to deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be realized 
in  we recorded a net income tax benefit of million 
this benefit was partially offset by income tax expense primarily associated with group lafon 
in light of our expectations for continued profitability  during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was probable that we would realize a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the benefit of accumulated international  federal and state net operating losses  and federal research and development credits 
we reduced the valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets accordingly 
in  the valuation allowance increased in total by million 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million for state net operating losses that we believe are unlikely to be realized in the future  partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowances for federal r d credits that we now expect will be realized due to our increasing profits 
cumulative effect of changing inventory costing method from fifo to lifo effective january   we changed our method of valuing domestic inventories from the first in  first out  or fifo method  to the last in  first out  or lifo method 
we recognized a charge of million in the first quarter of as the cumulative effect of adopting the lifo inventory costing method 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december  change change sales provigil    actiq    gabitril    other   total sales    total other revenues    total revenues    certain sales amounts for the year ended december  have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
revenues total sales in increased over the increase was attributable to a number of factors including sales of provigil increased by in compared to this increase was the net result of strong underlying demand for provigil in the us as evidenced by a increase in prescriptions filled over and a price increase effective june  these increases were partially offset by the reduction during of higher than normal inventory levels which existed at certain wholesalers at the end of due to significant speculative buying 
sales of modiodal  the trade name for modafinil in france  were million for for which there were no comparable amounts in sales of actiq increased in as compared to domestic sales increased driven by a increase in us prescriptions filled 
after our merger with anesta corp 
in october  we established a dedicated sales force for actiq and made ongoing changes to our marketing approach including hiring additional sales representatives and targeting our marketing efforts to pain specialists  all of which contributed to sales growth during a domestic price increase of effective march  also contributed to higher revenues 
sales of gabitril increased in as compared to as a result of a increase in us market demand driven by an expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts during  a average us price increase effective march   and the initiation of our european sales efforts  following the december acquisition of european rights to gabitril  which yielded million in sales 
product sales generated by group lafon  which we acquired on december   were million during the most significant product sales during were million of spasfon 
amounts recorded as other revenues consisted primarily of amortization of up front fees  ongoing research and development funding  milestone payments and certain payments under co promotional or managed services agreements 
total other revenues increased from year to year 
the increase was predominantly a result of the recognition of a full year of revenue recorded in under our collaboration agreement with sanofi synthelabo which became effective in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december  change change costs and expenses cost of sales    research and development    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    merger and integration acquired in process research and development   cost of sales the cost of sales in decreased to of product sales from in  principally due to the improvement in provigil margins as a result of our acquisition of group lafon 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million for from million for million of the increase was the result of research and development expenses incurred at group lafon during for which there are no comparable amounts in approximately million of this increase was due to higher expenditures on our clinical trials  including phase clinical studies for cep  studies related to our efforts to expand the label for provigil and to explore the utility of gabitril beyond their respective indications  and increased infrastructure costs to support the growing number of ongoing clinical trials 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to expenditures on development costs for compounds that progressed into later stages of development 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of million of group lafon expenses for which there were no comparable amounts in  and million associated with the expansion of both our us field sales force and promotional expenses for our products 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million during from million during  of which million was attributable to amortization of intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of group lafon and million was attributable to depreciation for property and equipment acquired from group lafon and depreciation from capitalized building improvements at our west chester and salt lake city locations 
the remainder of the increase was due to amortization expense associated with the capitalization of various payments in for additional provigil  actiq and gabitril product rights 
acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of group lafon in december  we acquired the rights to certain early stage technologies 
based on an independent appraisal of the assets acquired from group lafon  the fair value of these technologies of million was recorded as acquired in process research and development expense in because  at the date of the acquisition  the technologies acquired had not progressed to a stage where they met technological feasibility and there existed a significant amount of uncertainty as to our ability to complete the development of the technologies and achieve market acceptance within a reasonable timeframe 
in addition  the acquired in process technologies did not have an alternative future use to us that had reached technological feasibility 
for the year ended december  change change other income and expense interest income    interest expense    debt exchange expense   gain charge on early extinguishment of debt   other expense  net   other income and expense total other expenses  net  decreased million  or  in from due to interest income increased by million from due to higher average investment balances partially offset by lower average rates of return in interest expense increased by million from due primarily to a full year of interest recorded on the convertible subordinated notes issued in may and december of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
induced conversions of convertible debt  we recorded a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the exchange of million of our convertible notes for our common stock 
in december  we formed a joint venture with unaffiliated third party investors to fund additional commercial activities in support of provigil and gabitril in the united states 
in exchange for our transfer to the joint venture of certain intellectual property and other rights related to these two products  we received a class b interest  representing a interest in the joint venture 
in exchange for a contribution of million in cash to the joint venture  the investors received class a interests  also representing a interest in the joint venture 
we accounted for this transaction by recording the investors class a interests of million as long term debt on our balance sheet at december  on march   we acquired the investors class a interests and ended the joint venture by the issuance and sale in a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due march the purchase of the unaffiliated third party investors class a interests in connection with the termination of the joint venture resulted in the recognition of an extinguishment of debt charge of million during the first quarter of in may  we paid million to novartis pharma ag for deferred obligations due to them under our november collaboration agreement 
in connection with this payment  we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of of million 
other expense increased in as compared to primarily as a result of the effect of changes in the currency exchange value of the pound sterling gbp and the euro relative to the settlement of transactions in other currencies  and to an increase in the currency exchange value of the gbp relative to our other foreign operations currencies that were remeasured into the gbp for financial reporting purposes 
for the year ended december  change change income tax benefit  net   cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  dividends on convertible exchangeable preferred stock  income tax benefit  net we recorded a net income tax benefit of million in in light of our expectations for continued profitability  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit of the accumulated international  federal and state net operating losses  and federal research and development credits 
we reduced the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets accordingly 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows 
this income tax benefit was partially offset by income tax expense primarily associated with our group lafon operations 
cumulative effect of changing inventory costing method from fifo to lifo effective january   we changed our method of valuing domestic inventories from the first in  first out  or fifo method  to the last in  first out  or lifo method 
we recognized a charge of million in the first quarter of as the cumulative effect of adopting the lifo inventory costing method 
the acquisition of group lafon s manufacturing operations and the planned expansion of our internal manufacturing capacity for actiq reduced our reliance on third party manufacturers and allowed us to benefit from efficiencies of scale and corresponding lower per unit inventory costs 
the lifo method reflects these changes to manufacturing costs on the statement of operations on a more timely basis  resulting in a better matching of current costs of products sold with product revenues 
cost of product sales under the lifo inventory costing method was million lower in than it would have been under the fifo method 
dividends on convertible exchangeable preferred stock during  we sold  shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
as of december   all outstanding preferred shares had converted into shares of our common stock and  therefore  no dividends were recorded in liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were billion  representing of total assets  up from million  or of total assets  at december  a large portion of the increase of million was due to net proceeds of million received from the sale in june of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes and the related sale of warrants and purchase of hedge options  partially offset by the retirement of million in convertible subordinated notes 
working capital  which is calculated as current assets less current liabilities  was billion at december  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to higher income from operations in as a result of our increased sales 
net cash used for investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for significant acquisitions of intangible assets in included a payment of million for the october acquisition of actiq marketing rights in certain countries from elan and a payment of million to abbott pursuant to the extension of the gabitril composition of matter patent 
during we had net reductions to our investment portfolio of million as compared to net additions of million in our investment approach during has been to maintain liquidity in order to expediently access our funds for any potential mergers and acquisitions 
during  we purchased non marketable securities totaling million  including securities of mds proteomics inc  a privately held canadian company 
we made capital expenditures of million in and million in these expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements at our west chester  salt lake city and france locations to accommodate our growth and also for manufacturing equipment at our salt lake city location for the production of actiq for the us and european markets 
net cash provided by used for financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used for financing activities of million in the change is primarily the result of net proceeds of million received from the sale of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes partially offset by the retirement of million in convertible subordinated notes 
concurrent with the sale of the zero coupon notes  we purchased a convertible note hedge for million and sold warrants for million 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in us district court in new jersey against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  and barr laboratories  inc based upon the andas filed by each of these companies seeking fda approval for a generic version of modafinil 
the lawsuit claims infringement of our us patent no 
re  which covers pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment with the form of modafinil contained in provigil 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of this patent 
this litigation is currently in the discovery phase and we expect that the trial will begin sometime in we are a party to certain other litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including  among others  us patent interference proceedings  european patent oppositions  and matters alleging employment discrimination  product liability and breach of commercial contract 
we are vigorously defending ourselves in all of the actions against us and do not believe these matters  even if adversely adjudicated or settled  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
cephalon clinical partners  lp in august  we exclusively licensed our rights to myotrophin for human therapeutic use within the united states  canada and europe to cephalon clinical partners  lp ccp 
a subsidiary of cephalon is the sole general partner of ccp 
we developed myotrophin on behalf of ccp under a research and development agreement 
under this agreement  ccp granted an exclusive license to us to manufacture and market myotrophin for human therapeutic use within the united states  canada and europe  and we agreed to make royalty payments equal to a percentage of product sales and a milestone payment of approximately million upon regulatory approval 
we have a contractual option  but not an obligation  to purchase all of the limited partnership interests of ccp  which is exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events following the first commercial sale of myotrophin 
if  and only if  we decide to exercise this purchase option  we would make an advance payment of approximately million in cash or  at our election  approximately million in shares of common stock or a combination thereof 
if we discontinue development of myotrophin  or if we do not exercise this purchase option  our license will terminate and all rights to manufacture or market myotrophin in the united states  canada and europe will revert to ccp  which may then commercialize myotrophin itself or license or assign its rights to a third party 
in that event  we would not receive any benefits from such commercialization  license or assignment of rights 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
subsequently  in december  the fasb issued a revised version of fin fin r 
fin and fin r require a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin and fin r also require disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin and fin r apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing special purpose entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  for all other entities  the requirements of fin and fin r apply in the first period ending after march  as a result of the adoption of the standards  ccp has been consolidated in our financial statements at december  this consolidation did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
capital lease obligations under the terms of certain of our lease agreements  we must maintain a minimum balance in unrestricted cash and investments of million or deliver to the lessor an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of the then outstanding balance under such leases 
as of december   the amount due under such leases was million 
other commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other long term debt      capital lease obligations  operating leases      convertible notes     other long term liabilities on balance sheet   total contractual cash obligations    in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
we also have agreed to acquire cima labs  subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions  for a net transaction value of approximately million 
see outlook below 
outlook cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were billion 
we expect to use our remaining cash  cash equivalents and investments for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights  or technologies  the payment of contractual obligations  including scheduled interest payments on our convertible notes  and or the purchase  redemption or retirement of our convertible notes 
prior to  we had negative cash flows from operations and used the proceeds of public and private placements of our equity and debt securities to fund operations 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of sales growth in and beyond  such as the degree of market acceptance and exclusivity of our products  competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to demonstrate the utility of our products in indications beyond those already included in the fda approved labels 
however  we expect that sales of our three most significant marketed products  provigil  actiq and gabitril  in combination with other revenues  should allow us to continue to generate profits and positive cash flows from operations in the near term 
analysis of prescription data for provigil in the united states indicates physicians have elected to prescribe the product to treat a number of indications outside of its currently labeled indication of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy 
our strategy for provigil is to broaden the range of clinical uses that are approved by the fda and european regulatory agencies to include many of its currently prescribed uses 
in january  we received approval from the fda to expand the label for provigil to include improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with swsd and osa hs 
in the first quarter of  we launched provigil for these new indications with an expanded sales force of nearly persons 
we expect the addition of these new indications  coupled with a larger sales force  to have a meaningful and positive impact on provigil sales in continued sales growth of provigil beyond the december expiration of orphan drug exclusivity depends  in part  on our maintaining protection on the modafinil particle size patent through its expiration beginning in if we perform an additional clinical study of provigil in pediatric patients that is agreeable to the fda  the fda could grant us a six month extension of our orphan drug exclusivity to june and six months of exclusivity beyond the expiration of the particle size patent term 
we intend to perform such a study when we reach an agreement with the fda 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in us district court in new jersey against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  and barr laboratories  inc based upon the andas filed by each of these companies seeking fda approval for a generic equivalent of modafinil 
the lawsuit claims infringement of our us patent no 
re  which covers the pharmaceutical compositions and uses of modafinil 
this litigation is currently in the discovery phase and we expect that the trial will begin sometime in while we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of this patent  these efforts will be both expensive and time consuming and  ultimately  may not be successful 
see certain risks related to our business 
our sales of actiq also depend on our existing patent protection for the approved compressed powder formulation  which expires in the us in september  and for the formulation of actiq we sold prior to june  which expires in may if we perform an additional clinical study in pediatric patients that is agreeable to the fda  the fda could grant us six months of exclusivity beyond the expiration of these patents 
we intend to perform such a study once a mutually agreed upon clinical protocol is reached with the fda 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenditures associated with conducting additional clinical studies to explore the utility of these products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
with respect to provigil  we are currently enrolling patients into phase clinical programs in adhd in children and have commenced a phase program for nuvigil  the r isomer of modafinil 
with respect to gabitril  we have completed dose ranging studies in the therapeutic areas of anxiety  neuropathic pain and insomnia 
in the second quarter of  we initiated larger phase studies for gabitril in generalized anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder  which should be completed in the first half of depending on the results of these studies  we would expect to begin a phase program in one of these indications in the second half of in early  we initiated an additional phase study of gabitril in insomnia 
in  we also expect to conduct studies of a sugar free formulation of actiq and to continue our phase studies of cep for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
in the future  we expect to continue to incur significant expenditures to fund research and development activities  including clinical trials  for our other product candidates and for improved formulations for our existing products 
in the future  we may seek to mitigate the risk in our research and development programs by seeking sources of funding for a portion of these expenses through collaborative arrangements with third parties 
however  we intend to retain a portion of the commercial rights to these programs and  as a result  we still expect to spend significant funds on our share of the cost of these programs  including the costs of research  preclinical development  clinical research and manufacturing 
we also expect to incur significant expenditures in associated with manufacturing  selling and marketing our products 
for example  in we expect to begin a nearly million capital expansion of our production facility in salt lake city that will be substantially complete by late and that will increase our actiq capacity and provide us with flexibility to manufacture other products at this facility 
with respect to our sales and marketing efforts  we anticipate significantly higher expenditures in compared to  primarily as a result of the recent expansion of our sales force 
we may have significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of product sales and cost of product sales  inventory stocking or destocking practices of our large customers  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  marketing and other expenses  and manufacturing or supply disruptions 
we have significant indebtedness outstanding  consisting principally of indebtedness on convertible subordinated notes 
the following table summarizes the principal terms of our convertible subordinated notes outstanding as of december  security outstanding in millions conversion price other convertible subordinated notes due december redeemable on or after december  at our option at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
convertible subordinated notes due march redeemable on march  at option of holder at a redemption price of of principal amount redeemed 
zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
stated conversion prices as per the terms of the notes 
however  each convertible note contains certain terms restricting a holder s ability to convert the notes  including that a holder may only convert if the closing price of our stock on the day prior to conversion is higher than or with respect to the notes or the notes  respectively 
for a more complete description of these notes  including the convertible note hedge strategy we entered into when we sold the notes and the related potential impact of the notes and hedge strategy on the calculation of earnings per share  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the annual interest payments on the  million of convertible notes outstanding as of december  are million  payable at various dates throughout the year 
in the future  we may agree to exchanges of the notes for shares of our common stock or may determine to use a portion of our existing cash on hand to purchase  redeem or retire all or a portion of the outstanding convertible notes 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution relating to our million convertible notes in the aggregate notional amount of million 
under the swap  we agreed to pay a variable interest rate on this million notional amount equal to libor bba 
in exchange for the financial institution s agreement to pay a fixed rate of 
the variable interest rate is re calculated at the beginning of each quarter 
effective january   the interest rate is 
we also agreed to provide the financial institution with cash collateral to support our obligations under the agreement 
the current collateral amount is million and is recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
on november   we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire by merger all of the outstanding shares of cima labs inc 
for cash per share 
the total value of the transaction is approximately million net of cima s cash and cash equivalents as of december   which we would expect to fund from our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the merger is subject to certain closing conditions  including the approval of the merger agreement by the stockholders of cima and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hsr act 
on january   we received a request for additional information from the federal trade commission pertaining to the pending merger 
this request extends the waiting period under the hsr act during which the ftc is permitted to review the proposed transaction 
if the hsr condition is not satisfied and the transaction is not closed by june  unless the parties mutually agree to an extension  we will be required to pay cima a break fee in the amount of million 
although we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to complete this transaction  in the future our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate future acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds to complete these transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
in february  we filed with the sec a billion universal shelf registration statement covering the issuance and sale from time to time  of common and preferred stock  debt securities and warrants 
while we have no current plans to access the capital markets  the shelf registration statement would allow us to expediently access capital markets periodically in the future 
based on our current level of operations and projected sales of our products combined with other revenues and interest income  we believe that we will be able to service our existing debt and meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the near term 
however  we cannot be sure that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that we will continue to generate significant positive cash flow from operations 
we may need to obtain additional funding for future significant strategic transactions  to repay our outstanding indebtedness or for our future operational needs  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are developed  and challenged periodically  by management based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in item of this form k 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition in the united states  we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which account for approximately of our current worldwide net sales 
decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventories they hold can materially affect the level of our sales in any period 
we attempt to minimize these fluctuations  both by providing  from time to time  discounts to our customers to stock normal amounts of inventory and by canceling orders if we believe a particular customer is speculatively buying inventory in anticipation of possible price increases 
we have no agreements  understandings  or business practices under which we extend incentives based on levels of inventory held by wholesalers  and any incentives we may offer are not intended to have any relation to the wholesaler s cost of carrying inventory 
we believe that wholesaler inventories as of december  for all three of our products were within a normal range 
at december   inventory levels maintained by wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains were approximately one month s supply for all three of our us products according to ims health 
sales recorded for the year ended december  were generally representative of underlying demand for the products 
product sales are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product to the customer 
in the united states  we sell all commercial products fob shipping point 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product pass to the customer at the point that the product is picked up by a common carrier for shipment to the customer 
in europe  product sales are recognized predominantly upon customer receipt of the product  except in certain contractual arrangements where different terms may be specified 
we record product sales net of estimated reserves for contractual allowances  discounts and returns 
contractual allowances result from sales under contracts with managed care organizations and government agencies 
other revenue  which includes revenues from collaborative agreements  consists primarily of up front fees  ongoing research and development funding  milestone payments and payments under co promotional or managed services agreements 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement 
we adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based upon available facts and circumstances 
we recognize periodic payments over the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the agreements 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based upon the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract or as a measure of substantive progress towards completion under the contract 
payments under co promotional or managed services agreements are recognized over the period when the products are sold or the promotional activities are performed 
the portion of the payments that represent reimbursement of our expenses is recognized as an offset to those expenses in our results of operations 
inventories our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of raw materials  labor  overhead and shipping and handling costs 
cost is computed on domestic inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
for the majority of our foreign inventories  the first in  first out fifo method is utilized 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in our opinion  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  we establish a reserve against the inventories carrying value 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated decreases in demand could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
to date  inventory adjustments have not been material 
valuation of property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and investments our property and equipment have been recorded at cost and are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
our intangible assets which consist primarily of developed technology  trademarks  and product and marketing rights  are amortized over estimated useful lives which are intended to approximate the estimated pattern of economic benefits generated by the asset 
determining the estimated pattern of economic benefit for an intangible asset is a highly subjective and difficult assessment 
to the extent that the pattern cannot be reliably determined  a straight line amortization method has been used 
in conjunction with acquisitions of businesses or product rights  we allocate the purchase price based upon the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired 
in certain circumstances  fair value may be assigned to purchased in process research and development and  as such  expensed immediately 
we regularly assess whether intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill have been impaired and adjust the carrying values of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that some or all of the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operating performances of our businesses and products 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the carrying values of our property and equipment  intangible assets or goodwill are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
if we determine that events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our company and its goodwill  we would consult with one or more valuation specialists in estimating the impact of these on our estimate of fair value 
we believe the estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of common valuation practices 
no impairment losses on intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill have been recorded to date 
we evaluate the recoverability and measure the possible impairment of our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
our estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company  as well as i publicly available information regarding comparable publicly traded companies in the pharmaceutical industry  ii the financial projections and future prospects of our business  including our growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and iii comparable sales prices  if available 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  we compare our estimate of fair value for the company to the book value of our consolidated net assets 
if the book value of our consolidated net assets were greater than our estimate of fair value  we would then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step measures the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination  and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess 
we performed our annual test of impairment of goodwill as of july  we have only one reporting unit  a pharmaceutical unit  that constitutes our entire business 
we compared the fair value of this reporting unit with its carrying value 
the quoted market value of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the nasdaq national market at july  was used as the fair value of the reporting unit 
since the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at july   no adjustment to our goodwill for impairment was necessary 
we evaluate our investments in non marketable securities of outside entities on a quarterly basis by reviewing key indicators of the entities financial performance  condition and outlook 
we review the entities most recent financial statements and discuss the entities current and future financial and operational strategies with their senior management personnel 
we also discuss with our senior research and development personnel the current status of and future expectations for any collaborative agreements we have with those entities 
based on this information  we make a determination as to whether any impairment in the carrying value of our investments exists 
this determination is a highly subjective process that is based on the evaluation of qualitative information and numerous assumptions as to future events 
nonetheless  we believe our evaluation process provides a reasonable basis for our determination 
in  we recorded a million charge relating to the write off as r d expense of the value of an investment in an unaffiliated entity 
any additional impairment loss on one or more of our investments could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
prior to  we had a history of losses from our operations  which generated significant international  federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if we believe that we are not likely to realize future tax benefits 
based on our profitability for the year ended december  and projected future results  in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was likely that we would be able to realize a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  and therefore  we reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
as a result  beginning in  we began providing for income taxes at a rate equal to our estimated annual combined federal  state and foreign statutory effective rates 
subsequent adjustments to our estimates of our ability to recover the deferred tax assets or other changes in circumstances or estimates could cause our provision for income taxes to vary from period to period 
we also adjust our remaining valuation allowance periodically based on our evaluation of the ability to realize the future tax benefits of our deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires recognition of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets when a legal obligation to incur such costs arises as a result of the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense over the asset s useful life 
we adopted sfas on january  the adoption of this new standard did not impact our current financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement amends or rescinds certain existing authoritative pronouncements including sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses on extinguishment of debt  such that the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions must now be followed to determine if the early extinguishment of debt should be classified as an extraordinary item 
in addition  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that does not meet the criteria in apb must be reclassified 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we adopted this new standard effective december  and reclassified all gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt as other income and expense  rather than extraordinary items  in our current financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the statement requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recorded at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
sfas is effective for disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of this new standard did not impact our current financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the additional disclosure requirements of sfas effective january  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees 
this interpretation requires that upon the issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of this new statement did not impact our current financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
subsequently  in december  the fasb issued a revised version of fin fin r 
fin and fin r require a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin and fin r also require disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin and fin r apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing special purpose entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  for all other entities  the requirements of fin and fin r apply in the first period ending after march  as a result of the adoption of the standards  cephalon clinical partners  lp has been consolidated in our financial statements at december  this consolidation did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
our investments in non marketable securities of other entities are not considered variable interest entities and  therefore  we have not consolidated these entities 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of fasb statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative discussed in sfas no 
 clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to language used in fin no 
 and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of this new standard did not impact our current financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this new standard has been considered in accounting for our convertible note hedge and warrants 
in may  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying this issue  separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
this issue also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the application of this issue did not impact our current financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit costs of defined benefit plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december   except for certain disclosures about foreign plans which are effective for fiscal years ending after june  since all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans are foreign plans  we will adopt the additional disclosure requirements of this statement in certain risks related to our business you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report  before making an investment decision 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from us sales of our three largest products  and our future success will depend on the continued acceptance and growth of these products 
for the year ended december   approximately of our worldwide net sales were derived from sales of provigil  actiq and gabitril 
we cannot be certain that these products will continue to be accepted in their markets 
specifically  the following factors  among others  could affect the level of market acceptance of provigil  actiq and gabitril the perception of the healthcare community of their safety and efficacy  both in an absolute sense and relative to that of competing products  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  particularly with respect to our efforts in directed to general practitioners for the indications approved for provigil in january  any unfavorable publicity regarding these products or similar products  the price of the product relative to other competing drugs or treatments  any changes in government and other third party payer reimbursement policies and practices  and regulatory developments affecting the manufacture  marketing or use of these products 
any material adverse developments with respect to the sale or use of provigil  actiq and gabitril could significantly reduce our product revenues and have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate net income and positive net cash flow from operations 
we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to expand the number and scope of authorized uses of provigil or gabitril  which would significantly hamper sales and earnings growth 
even with the broader approval in january of a label for provigil  the markets for the approved indications of provigil and gabitril remain relatively small 
analysis of prescription data indicates that a significant portion of our product sales is derived from the use of these products outside of their labeled indications 
we believe that the growth of provigil and gabitril will be greater if we are able to further expand the approved indications for these products 
to this end  we are developing a proprietary formulation of modafinil for the treatment of adhd in children and are currently enrolling patients into a phase program 
we also have initiated phase studies of gabitril in generalized anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder and  in early  an additional phase study of gabitril in insomnia 
if the results of these phase gabitril studies are positive  we will need to conduct additional studies before we can apply to regulatory authorities to expand the authorized uses of gabitril for these indications 
we do not know whether these current or future studies will demonstrate safety and efficacy  or if they do  whether we will succeed in receiving regulatory approval to market these products for these or other disorders 
if the results of some of these additional studies are negative  this could undermine physician and patient comfort with the product  limit its commercial success  and diminish its acceptance 
even if the results of these studies are positive  the impact on sales of these products may be minimal unless we are able to obtain fda and foreign medical authority approval to expand the authorized uses of this product 
fda regulations limit our ability to communicate the results of additional clinical studies to patients and physicians without first obtaining regulatory approval for any expanded uses 
we may not be able to maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property or market exclusivity for certain of our products and  therefore  competitors may develop competing products  which could result in a decrease in sales and market share  cause us to reduce prices to compete successfully and limit our commercial success 
we place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection for new technologies  products and processes 
to that end  we file applications for patents covering the compositions or uses of our drug candidates or our proprietary processes 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding breadth of claims in such companies patents 
accordingly  the patents and patent applications relating to our products  product candidates and technologies may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technology 
patent disputes in our industry are frequent and can preclude commercialization of products 
if we ultimately engage in and lose any such disputes  we could be subject to competition or significant liabilities  we could be required to enter into third party licenses or we could be required to cease using technology or product in dispute 
in addition  even if such licenses are available  the terms of any license requested by a third party could be unacceptable to us 
the us composition of matter patent for modafinil expired in we own us and foreign patent rights that expire between and covering pharmaceutical compositions and uses of modafinil and  more specifically  covering certain particle sizes of modafinil contained in the pharmaceutical composition 
ultimately  these patents might be found invalid as the result of a challenge by a third party  or a potential competitor could develop a competing product or product formulation that avoids infringement of these patents 
to date  the fda has accepted four andas  for pharmaceutical products containing modafinil 
each of these andas contained a paragraph iv certification in which the anda applicant certified that the us particle size modafinil patent covering provigil either is invalid or will not be infringed by the anda product 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in us district court in new jersey against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  and barr laboratories  inc 
based upon the andas filed by each of these companies with the fda 
the lawsuit claims infringement of our us patent no 
re while we intend to vigorously defend the validity of this patent and prevent infringement  these efforts will be both expensive and time consuming and  ultimately  may not be successful 
this litigation is currently in the discovery phase  and we expect that the trial will begin sometime in in early  barr and ranbaxy each announced the receipt of tentative fda approval for their respective generic versions of provigil 
if the court finds the particle size patent is invalid or not infringed  barr and ranbaxy could begin selling their modafinil based products upon the expiration of our fda orphan drug exclusivity  currently in december  which would significantly and negatively impact revenues from provigil 
we do not know whether the andas filed by teva and mylan have been  or will be  tentatively approved by the fda if we perform an additional clinical study of provigil in pediatric patients that is acceptable to the fda  the fda could grant us a six month extension of our orphan drug exclusivity to june and six months of exclusivity beyond the expiration of the particle size patent term 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to reach an agreement with the fda with respect to an appropriate pediatric study 
with respect to actiq  we hold an exclusive license to a us patent covering the currently approved compressed powder pharmaceutical composition and methods for administering fentanyl via this composition that is set to expire in september  though the fda could grant us a six month extension of these patents when we perform a clinical study in pediatric patients 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to reach an agreement with the fda with respect to an appropriate pediatric study 
corresponding patents in foreign countries are set to expire between and our patent protection with respect to the actiq formulation we sold prior to june will expire in may the loss of patent protection on actiq  beginning as early as may in the united states  could significantly and negatively impact our revenues from the sale of actiq 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancements to support our competitive position 
although we have entered into confidentiality and invention rights agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators  these parties could fail to honor such agreements or we could be unable to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know how 
moreover  others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
in addition  many of our scientific and management personnel have been recruited from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies where they were conducting research in areas similar to those that we now pursue 
as a result  we could be subject to allegations of trade secret violations and other claims 
manufacturing  supply and distribution problems may create supply disruptions that could result in a reduction of product sales revenue and an increase in costs of sales  and damage commercial prospects for our products 
the manufacture  supply and distribution of pharmaceutical products  both inside and outside the united states  is highly regulated and complex 
we  and the third parties we rely upon for the manufacturing and distribution of our products  must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the fda and foreign authorities  including current good manufacturing practice regulations 
in addition  we must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the drug enforcement administration and analogous foreign authorities for certain of our products that contain controlled substances 
the facilities used to manufacture  store and distribute our products also are subject to inspection by regulatory authorities at any time to determine compliance with regulations 
these regulations are complex  and any failure to comply with them could lead to remedial action  civil and criminal penalties and delays in production or distribution of material 
in april  we initiated a voluntary recall of certain batches of actiq that were distributed in europe based upon our determination that some units in these batches might contain levels of fentanyl that were higher than those established in the product specifications 
the recall resulted in a reduction of sales revenue and an increase in cost of sales in the first half of  with an aggregate financial impact in the amount of million 
we predominately depend upon single sources for the manufacture of both the active drug substances contained in our products and for finished commercial supplies 
for example provigil our manufacturing facility in france is the sole source of the active drug substance modafinil 
with respect to finished commercial supplies of provigil  we currently have two qualified manufacturers  dsm pharmaceuticals  in greenville  north carolina  and patheon  inc  in ontario  canada 
actiq our us facility in salt lake city  utah  is the sole source for the worldwide manufacture of actiq 
gabitril abbott laboratories manufactures finished commercial supplies of gabitril for the us market through at least october and sanofi synthelabo manufactures gabitril for non us markets through january 
we have identified a third party manufacturer for the future worldwide production of the active drug substance tiagabine and finished commercial supplies of gabitril 
we are in the process of qualifying this manufacturer with appropriate us and european regulatory authorities 
other products certain of our products are manufactured at our facilities in france  with the remaining products manufactured by single source third parties 
the process of changing or adding a manufacturer or changing a formulation requires prior fda and or european medical authority approval and is very time consuming 
if we are unable to manage this process effectively or if an unforeseen event occurs at any facility  we could face supply disruptions that would result in significant costs and delays  undermine goodwill established with physicians and patients  damage commercial prospects for our products and adversely affect operating results 
we also rely on third parties to distribute our products  perform customer service activities and accept and process product returns 
as our products are used commercially  unintended side effects  adverse reactions or incidents of misuse may occur that could result in additional regulatory controls and reduced sales of our products 
during research and development  the use of pharmaceutical products  such as ours  is limited principally to clinical trial patients under controlled conditions and under the care of expert physicians 
the widespread commercial use of our products could produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in our clinical trials or the relatively limited commercial use to date 
in addition  in patients who take multiple medications  drug interactions could occur that can be difficult to predict 
additionally  incidents of product misuse  product diversion or theft may occur 
these events  among others  could result in additional regulatory controls that could limit the circumstances under which the product is prescribed or even lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market 
more specifically  actiq has been approved under regulations concerning drugs with certain safety profiles  under which the fda has established special restrictions to ensure safe use 
any violation of these special restrictions could lead to the imposition of further restrictions or withdrawal of the product from the market 
we face significant product liability risks  which may have a negative effect on our financial performance 
the administration of drugs to humans  whether in clinical trials or commercially  can result in product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually at fault for causing an injury 
furthermore  our products may cause  or may appear to have caused  adverse side effects including death or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug has been administered to patients for some time 
as our products are used more widely and in patients with varying medical conditions  the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction  unintended side effect or incidence of misuse may increase 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us  which could have a negative effect on our financial performance 
the costs of product liability insurance have increased dramatically in recent years  and the availability of coverage has decreased 
nevertheless  we maintain product liability insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable 
any claims could easily exceed our coverage limits 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
our activities and products are subject to significant government regulations and approvals  which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we fail to comply 
we currently have a number of products that have been approved for sale in the united states  foreign countries or both 
all of our approved products are subject to extensive continuing regulations relating to  among other things  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling  and promotion 
the failure to comply with any rules and regulations of the fda or any foreign medical authority  or the post approval discovery of previously unknown problems relating to our products  could result in  among other things fines  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspension of manufacturing activities and or product sales  non approval of product license applications  restrictions on our ability to enter into strategic relationships  and criminal prosecution 
it is both costly and time consuming for us to comply with these regulations 
additionally  incidents of adverse drug reactions  unintended side effects or misuse relating to our products could result in additional regulatory controls or restrictions  or even lead to withdrawal of a product from the market 
with respect to our product candidates and for new therapeutic indications for our existing products  we conduct research  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
we cannot market these product candidates or these new indications in the united states or other countries without receiving approval from the fda or the appropriate foreign medical authority 
the approval process is highly uncertain and requires substantial time  effort and financial resources 
ultimately  we may never obtain approval in a timely manner  or at all 
without these required approvals  our ability to substantially grow revenues in the future could be adversely affected 
in addition  because provigil and actiq contain active ingredients that are controlled substances  we are subject to regulation by the dea and analogous foreign organizations relating to the manufacture  shipment  sale and use of the applicable products 
these regulations also are imposed on prescribing physicians and other third parties  making the storage  transport and use of such products relatively complicated and expensive 
with the increased concern for safety by the fda and the dea with respect to products containing controlled substances  it is possible that these regulatory agencies could impose additional restrictions on marketing or even withdraw regulatory approval for such products 
in addition  adverse publicity may bring about rejection of the product by the medical community 
if the dea  fda or a foreign medical authority withdrew the approval of  or placed additional significant restrictions on the marketing of any of our products  our product sales and ability to promote our products could be substantially affected 
we may be unable to repay our substantial indebtedness and other obligations 
as of december   we had  million of indebtedness outstanding  including  million outstanding under convertible notes with stated conversion prices or restricted conversion prices higher than our stock price as of the date of this filing 
of our outstanding convertible notes  million matures in there are no restrictions on our use of our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  and we cannot be sure that these funds will be available or sufficient in the future to enable us to repay our indebtedness 
in the future  these factors  among other things  could make it difficult for us to service  repay or refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing in the future  or limit our future flexibility and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
unless we are able to generate cash flow from operations that  together with our available cash on hand  is sufficient to repay our indebtedness  we will be required to raise additional funds 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
our product sales and related financial results will fluctuate  and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall  especially if investors do not anticipate them 
a number of analysts and investors who follow our stock have developed models to attempt to forecast future product sales and expenses  and have established earnings expectations based upon those models 
these models  in turn  are based in part on estimates of projected revenue and earnings that we disclose publicly 
forecasting future revenues is difficult  especially when we only have a few years of commercial history and when the level of market acceptance of our products is uncertain 
forecasting is further complicated by the difficulties in estimating both existing stocking levels at pharmaceutical wholesalers and retail pharmacies and the timing of their purchases to replenish these stocks 
as a result  it is likely that our revenues will fluctuate significantly  which may not meet with market expectations and which also may adversely affect our stock price 
there are a number of other factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate unexpectedly  including cost of product sales  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  marketing and other expenses  manufacturing or supply disruptions  and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies 
the efforts of government entities and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care may adversely affect our sales and limit the commercial success of our products 
in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of pharmaceutical products is subject to various forms of direct and indirect governmental control  including the control over the amount of reimbursements provided to the patient who is prescribed specific pharmaceutical products 
for example  we are aware of governmental efforts in france to limit or eliminate reimbursement for some of our products  which could impact revenues from our french operations 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  various proposals to implement similar controls 
the commercial success of our products could be limited if federal or state governments adopt any such proposals 
in addition  in the united states and elsewhere  sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
these third party payers increasingly challenge the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and seek to limit reimbursement levels offered to consumers for such products 
these third party payers could focus their cost control efforts on our products  especially with respect to prices of and reimbursement levels for products prescribed outside their labeled indications 
in these cases  their efforts could negatively impact our product sales and profitability 
we experience intense competition in our fields of interest  which may adversely affect our business 
large and small companies  academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for product development in competition with us 
products developed by any of these entities may compete directly with those we develop or sell 
the conditions that our products treat  and some of the other disorders for which we are conducting additional studies  are currently treated with several drugs  many of which have been available for a number of years or are available in inexpensive generic forms 
with respect to provigil  there are several other products used for the treatment of excessive sleepiness or narcolepsy in the united states  including methylphenidate products such as ritalin by novartis  and in our other territories  many of which have been available for a number of years and are available in inexpensive generic forms 
with respect to actiq  we face competition from numerous short and long acting opioid products  including three products johnson johnson s duragesic  purdue pharmaceutical s oxycontin and ms contin that dominate the market 
we also are aware of numerous other companies developing other technologies for rapidly delivering opioids to treat breakthrough pain  including transmucosal  transdermal  nasal spray and inhaled delivery systems  among others 
for example  in september  johnson johnson filed an nda with the fda for e trans  a battery powered transdermal patch that allows on demand delivery of fentanyl with rapid absorption 
with respect to gabitril  there are several products  including neurontin gabapentin by pfizer  used as adjunctive therapy for the partial seizure market 
some are well established therapies that have been on the market for several years while others have recently entered the partial seizure marketplace 
in addition  several treatments for partial seizures are available in inexpensive generic forms 
thus  we need to demonstrate to physicians  patients and third party payers that the cost of our products is reasonable and appropriate in the light of their safety and efficacy  the price of competing products and the related health care benefits to the patient 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and substantially greater experience in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
these entities represent significant competition for us 
in addition  competitors who are developing products for the treatment of neurological or oncological disorders might succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that we develop or sell or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
competition and innovation from these or other sources  including advances in current treatment methods  could potentially affect sales of our products negatively or make our products obsolete 
furthermore  we may be at a competitive marketing disadvantage against companies that have broader product lines and whose sales personnel are able to offer more complementary products than we can 
any failure to maintain our competitive position could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of technologies  products and businesses  which may subject us to a number of risks and or result in us experiencing significant charges to earnings that may adversely affect our stock price  operating results and financial condition 
on november   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire by merger all of the outstanding shares of cima labs inc 
for per share in cash 
the merger is subject to certain closing conditions  including the approval of the merger agreement by cima labs stockholders and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of hsr 
on january   we received a request for additional information from the federal trade commission pertaining to the pending merger 
if the hsr condition is not satisfied and the transaction is not closed by june  unless the parties mutually agree to an extension  we will be required to pay cima labs a break fee in the amount of million 
if the transaction does not close for any reason  we will not realize the anticipated benefits of the cima labs transaction 
as part of our review of cima labs  we conducted business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction 
despite our efforts  we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and  as a result  we might not realize the intended advantages of the acquisition 
we also must consolidate and integrate the operations of cima labs with our business 
integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult and expensive than we predicted 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from this acquisition  or from acquisitions we may consummate in the future  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties  regulatory setbacks or otherwise  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  as a result of our efforts to acquire businesses or to enter into other significant transactions  such as cima labs  we have experienced  and will likely continue to experience  significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closure costs  acquired in process research and development charges or break fees 
these costs also may include substantial fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisers  as well as severance and other closure costs associated with the elimination of duplicate operations and facilities 
our incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 
the results and timing of our research and development activities  including future clinical trials  are difficult to predict  subject to potential future setbacks and  ultimately  may not result in viable pharmaceutical products  which may adversely affect our business 
in order to sustain our business  we focus substantial resources on the search for new pharmaceutical products 
these activities include engaging in discovery research and process development  conducting preclinical and clinical studies and seeking regulatory approval in the united states and abroad 
in all of these areas  we have relatively limited resources and compete against larger  multinational pharmaceutical companies 
moreover  even if we undertake these activities in an effective and efficient manner  regulatory approval for the sale of new pharmaceutical products remains highly uncertain because the majority of compounds discovered do not enter clinical studies and the majority of therapeutic candidates fail to show the human safety and efficacy necessary for regulatory approval and successful commercialization 
preclinical testing and clinical trials must demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and efficacious 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in subsequent clinical trials  and these clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates 
a number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
for ethical reasons  certain clinical trials are conducted with patients having the most advanced stages of disease and who have failed treatment with alternative therapies 
during the course of treatment  these patients often die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested 
such events can have a negative impact on the statistical analysis of clinical trial results 
the completion of clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed by many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
neither we nor our collaborators can control the rate at which patients present themselves for enrollment  and the rate of patient enrollment may not be consistent with our expectations or sufficient to enable clinical trials of our product candidates to be completed in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  we may not be permitted by regulatory authorities to undertake additional clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates 
even if such trials are conducted  our product candidates may not prove to be safe and efficacious or receive regulatory approvals 
any significant delays in  or termination of  clinical trials of our product candidates could impact our ability to generate product sales from these product candidates in the future 
our research and development and marketing efforts are often dependent on corporate collaborators and other third parties who may not devote sufficient time  resources and attention to our programs  which may limit our efforts to develop and market potential products 
because we have limited resources  we have entered into a number of collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies  including h 
lundbeck a s with respect to our research efforts in parkinson s disease  and with a number of marketing partners for our products in certain countries outside the united states 
in some cases  our collaboration agreements call for our partners to control the supply of bulk or formulated drugs for use in clinical trials or for commercial use  the design and execution of clinical studies  the process of obtaining regulatory approval to market the product  and or marketing and selling of an approved product 
in each of these areas  our partners may not support fully our research and commercial interests because our program may compete for time  attention and resources with the internal programs of our corporate collaborators 
as such  our program may not move forward as effectively  or advance as rapidly  as it might if we had retained complete control of all research  development  regulatory and commercialization decisions 
we also rely on some of these collaborators and other third parties for the production of compounds and the manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical products 
additionally  we may find it necessary from time to time to seek new or additional partners to assist us in commercializing our products  though we might not be successful in establishing any such new or additional relationships 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile  which may make it difficult for holders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile  and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future 
for example  from january  through march   our common stock traded at a high price of and a low price of 
negative announcements  including  among others adverse regulatory decisions  disappointing clinical trial results  disputes and other developments concerning patent or other proprietary rights with respect to our products  or operating results that fall below the market s expectations could trigger significant declines in the price of our common stock 
in addition  external events  such as news concerning economic conditions  our competitors  changes in government regulations impacting the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries or the movement of capital into or out of our industry  also are likely to affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
a portion of our revenues and expenses is subject to exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business  which could adversely affect our reported results of operations 
historically  a portion of our revenues and expenses has been earned and incurred  respectively  in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we translate revenues earned and expenses incurred into us dollars at the average exchange rate applicable during the relevant period 
a weakening of the us dollar would  therefore  increase both our revenues and expenses 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro and other currencies may affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
historically  we have not hedged our exposure to these fluctuations in exchange rates 
we are involved  or may become involved in the future  in legal proceedings that  if adversely adjudicated or settled  could materially impact our financial condition 
as a biopharmaceutical company  we are or may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including  among others  matters alleging employment discrimination  product liability  patent or other intellectual property rights infringement  patent invalidity or breach of commercial contract 
in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition 
we currently are vigorously defending ourselves against certain litigation matters 
while we currently do not believe that the settlement or adverse adjudication of these lawsuits would materially impact our results of operations or financial condition  the final resolution of these matters and the impact  if any  on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be material 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the united states 
three large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market 
for the year ended december   these wholesaler customers  cardinal health  inc  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation  in the aggregate  accounted for of our worldwide net sales 
the loss or bankruptcy of any of these customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on key executives and scientists could impact the development and management of our business 
we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development and management of our business 
although we do not believe the loss of one individual would materially harm our business  our research and development programs and our business might be harmed by the loss of the services of multiple existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner 
much of the know how we have developed resides in our scientific and technical personnel and is not readily transferable to other personnel 
while we have employment agreements with our key executives  we do not ordinarily enter into employment agreements with our other key scientific  technical and managerial employees 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations  and our related compliance may limit any future profitability 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous  infectious and radioactive materials that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment 
we store these materials  and various wastes resulting from their use  at our facilities pending ultimate use and disposal 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and wastes  and we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with related existing and future environmental laws and regulations 
while we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  which could include fines and remedial costs 
these damages could require payment by us of significant amounts over a number of years  which would be reflected in our results of operations and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent changes in control of our management or deter a third party from acquiring us  limiting our stockholders ability to profit from such a transaction 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  par value  of which  have been reserved for issuance in connection with our stockholder rights plan  and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
our stockholder rights plan could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of cephalon 
section  the rights plan  and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware corporate law  may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers  or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our operations in european subsidiaries that have transactions  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
historically  we have not hedged any of these foreign currency exchange risks 
for the year ended december   an average weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our european subsidiaries operate would have resulted in an increase of million in reported total revenues and a corresponding increase in reported expenses 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not assume any changes in the level of operations of our european subsidiaries 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution  relating to our million convertible subordinated notes  in the aggregate notional amount of million 
we pay interest under the swap based on the month libor bba rate plus basis points  adjusted quarterly 
at inception  we recognized a premium on the value of the bonds of million that we will amortize and recognize as interest expense over the remaining term of the notes 
we also recognize adjustments to interest expense based on changes in the fair values of the bonds and the swap agreement each quarter 
if libor increases or decreases by basis points  our annual interest expense would change by million 
changes in interest rates and the price and volatility of our common stock would also affect the fair values of the notes and the swap agreement  resulting in adjustments to interest expense 
in january  we entered into a foreign exchange contract to protect against fluctuations in the australian dollar against the us dollar related to our unsuccessful bid for sirtex medical limited 
we terminated this contract in the second quarter of except for the interest rate swap agreement described above  our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  since all of our outstanding debt is fixed rate 
our investments are classified as short term and as available for sale 
we do not believe that short term fluctuations in interest rates would materially affect the value of our securities
