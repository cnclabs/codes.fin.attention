because of the electronic industry trend towards moving manufacturing to lower operating cost countries in asia  the company has focused primarily on customers in china  taiwan  korea and hong kong 
we sell to asian customers of sales primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries  diodes taiwan and diodes hong kong 
the asian discrete semiconductor market is the largest and fastest growing market in which the company participates 
an increase in the percentage of sales in asia is expected as we have significantly increased our sales presence there and believes there is greater potential to increase market share in that region due to the expanding base of electronic product manufacturers 
our corporate headquarters located just outside los angeles in westlake village  california  which provides sales  marketing  engineering  logistics and warehousing functions  sells primarily to north american manufacturers and distributors of sales 
due to the manufacturing shift  the north american discrete semiconductor market is now the smallest market and its growth rate is far less than all other markets 
the majority of our applications engineers are located in the us in order to work with the customers design engineers 
whether the end application is ultimately manufactured in the us or in asia  our world wide sales organization is well positioned to provide sales and support to the customer 
in order to take advantage of the relatively robust european market  offices in toulouse  france and hattenheim  germany support our european sales expansion of sales 
asian sales are also generated from shanghai kaihong electronics co  ltd 
diodes china or kaihong  a owned manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  with offices in shanghai and shenzhen  china  as well as from fabtech incorporated diodes fabtech or fabtech  a silicon wafer manufacturer acquired in december located near kansas city  missouri 

table of contents manufacturing and significant vendors diodes china  located in shanghai  china  is our owned joint venture manufacturing facility 
since the factory s inception in  we have invested approximately million in plant and state of the art equipment 
diodes china manufactures product for sale by our us and asian operations  and also sells to external customers as well 
in  diodes china began selling to customers located in china 
at diodes china  silicon wafers are received and inspected in a highly controlled clean room environment awaiting the assembly operation 
at the first step of assembly  the wafers are sawn with very thin  high speed diamond blades into tiny semiconductor dice  numbering as many as  per diameter wafer 
dice are then loaded onto a handler  which automatically places the dice  one by one  onto lead frames  which are package specific  where they are bonded to the lead frame pad 
next  automatic wire bonders make the necessary electrical connections from the die to the leads of the lead frame  using micro thin gold wire 
the fully automatic assembly machinery then molds the epoxy case around the die and lead frame to produce the desired semiconductor product 
after a trim  form  test  mark and re test operation  the parts are placed into special carrier housings and a cover tape seals the parts in place 
the taped parts are then spooled onto reels and boxed for shipment 
acquired from lsc in december  our wafer foundry  diodes fabtech  is located in lee s summit  missouri 
diodes fabtech manufactures primarily inch silicon wafers  which are the building blocks for semiconductors 
fabtech purchases polished silicon wafers and then  by using various technologies and patents  in conjunction with many chemicals and gases  fabricates several layers on the wafers  including epitaxial silicon  ion implants  dielectrics and metals  with various patterns 
depending upon these layers and the die size which is determined during the photolithography process and completed at the customer s packaging site where the wafer is sawn into square or rectangular die  different types of wafers with various currents  voltages and switching speeds are produced 
in  our largest external supplier of products was lsc  a related party 
approximately and of our sales were from product manufactured by lsc in and  respectively 
also  in and  approximately and  respectively of our sales were from product manufactured by companies owned by xing international a related party 
in addition  sales of products manufactured by diodes china and diodes fabtech  our manufacturing subsidiaries  were approximately and in  respectively  versus and in  respectively 
we anticipate that diodes china will become an increasingly valuable supplier 
no other manufacturer of discrete semiconductors accounted for more than and of our sales in and  respectively 
all of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available both domestically and abroad 
although the we believe alternative sources exist for the products of any of our suppliers  the loss of any one of its principal suppliers or the loss of several suppliers in a short period of time could have a materially adverse effect on our financial statements until an alternate source is located and has commenced providing such products or raw materials 
related parties we conduct business with two related party companies  lsc and its subsidiaries and xing international and its subsidiaries 
lsc  a shareholder  is our largest shareholder  and xing international is owned by our joint venture partner in diodes china 
ch chen  our president and chief executive officer  and a member of the our board of directors  is also vice chairman of lsc 
mk lu  a member of our board of directors  is president of lsc  while raymond soong  our chairman of the board  is the chairman of the lite on group  a significant shareholder of lsc 
in addition to being our largest external supplier of products  in  we sold silicon wafers to lsc totaling in of our total sales  making lsc our largest customer 
the company has a long standing sales agreement where the company is the exclusive north american distributor for certain of lsc product lines 
in addition  the company leases warehouse space from lsc for its operations in hong kong 
such transactions are on terms no less favorable to the company than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
the audit committee of the board of directors has approved the contracts related to the transactions 
in december  the company acquired the wafer foundry  fabtech  inc  from lsc 
as part of the purchase price  at december   lsc holds a subordinated  interest bearing note for approximately million 
in may  the company renegotiated the terms of the note to extend the payment period from two years to four years  and therefore  payments of approximately  plus interest began in july in connection with the terms of the acquisition  lsc entered into a volume purchase agreement to purchase wafers from fabtech 
in addition  as per the terms of the stock purchase agreement  the company has entered into several management incentive agreements with members of fabtech s management 
the agreements provide members of fabtech s management guaranteed annual payments as well as contingent bonuses based on the annual profitability of fabtech  subject to a maximum annual amount 
any portion of the guaranteed and contingent liability paid by fabtech is reimbursed by lsc 

table of contents in addition to the of our sales of product manufactured by companies owned by xing international  in  the company sold silicon wafers to companies owned by xing international totaling in of the company s total sales 
in addition  diodes china leases its manufacturing facilities from  subcontracts a portion of its manufacturing process metal plating and environmental services to  and pays a consulting fee to xing international 
such transactions are on terms no less favorable to the company than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
the audit committee of the board of directors has approved the contracts related to the transactions 
income taxes in accordance with the current taxation policies of the people s republic of china prc  diodes china received preferential tax treatment for the years ended december  through earnings were subject to tax rates from through  and in  and earnings in will be taxed at one half the normal central government tax rate 
earnings of diodes china are also subject to tax of by the local taxing authority in shanghai 
the local taxing authority waived this tax in and  and is expected to waive this tax in earnings of diodes taiwan are currently subject to a tax rate of  which is comparable to the us federal tax rate for c corporations 
in accordance with us tax law  the company receives credit against its us federal tax liability for corporate taxes paid in taiwan and china 
the repatriation of funds from taiwan and china to the company may be subject to state income taxes 
in the years ending december  and  diodes taiwan distributed dividends of approximately million and million respectively  which is included in federal and state taxable income 
as of december   accumulated and undistributed earnings of diodes china are approximately million  including million of restricted earnings which are not available for dividends 
through march   the company had not recorded deferred us federal or state tax liabilities estimated to be million as of march  on these cumulative earnings since the company  at that time  considered this investment to be permanent  and had no plans or obligation to distribute all or part of that amount from china to the united states 
beginning in april  the company began to record deferred taxes on a portion of the earnings of diodes china in preparation of a dividend distribution 
as of december   the company has recorded million in deferred taxes and has made no distributions 
the company intends to dividend million from diodes china to the us in it is anticipated that this transaction will not have a material effect on net income as the us income taxes have already been accrued 
beginning in november  the company began to record deferred taxes on a portion of the earnings of diodes hong kong in preparation of a possible dividend distribution 
as of december   the company has recorded  in deferred taxes and has made no distributions 
the company is evaluating the need to provide additional deferred taxes for the future earnings of diodes china and diodes hong kong to the extent such earnings may be appropriated for distribution to the company s corporate office in north america  and as further investment strategies with respect to diodes china are determined 
should the company s north american cash requirements exceed the cash that is provided through the domestic credit facilities  cash can be obtained from the company s foreign subsidiaries 
however  the distribution of any unappropriated funds to the us will require the recording of income tax provisions on the us entity  thus reducing net income

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the product is actually shipped to both manufacturing end users and electronic component distributors 
we reduce revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances  the majority of which are related to our north american operations 
our estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of revenues  distributor inventories  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in quarterly adjustments to revenues 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory  both finished goods and raw material  for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by items  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
based upon this analysis  as well as an inventory aging analysis  we accrue a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
management continually evaluates its deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if management ever determined that its deferred tax asset was not likely to be realized  a write down of the asset would be required and would be reflected as an expense in the accompanying period 
allowance for doubtful accounts management evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors  including the current business environment and historical experience 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect to bad debt expense 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage that certain items in the statement of income bear to net sales and the percentage dollar increase decrease of such items from period to period

the following discussion explains in greater detail the consolidated financial condition of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
earnings per share discussion reflects three for two stock split in november all per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
year compared to year net sales for increased million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to a increase in units sold as a result of increased demand for the company s products  as well as a more favorable pricing environment compared to in  average selling prices asps for discrete products increased while asp s for wafers fell  consequently  overall asps decreased 
gross profit for increased to million from million for of the million increase  million was due to the increase in gross profit margin from in to in  while million was due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit increases in asia were the primary contributor to the gross profit increase in gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of increased to due to increased capacity utilization  continuing manufacturing efficiencies  relatively stable pricing  and a product mix that continues to shift towards higher value performance discretes and arrays 
for  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million from million for the increase in sg a was due primarily to higher sales commissions associated with the increase in sales  and higher labor benefits expenses 
also contributing to the increased sg a were higher corporate and administrative expenses  including legal and accounting fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
sg a  as a percentage of sales  increased to for from last year 
research and development expenses r d increased to million  or of sales  in from million  or of sales  in r d expenses are primarily related to new product development at the silicon wafer level  and  to a lesser extent  at the packaging level 
we continue to seek to hire qualified engineers who fit our focus on next generation discrete processes and packaging technologies 
our goal is to expand r d to of revenue as we bring proprietary technology and advanced devices to the market 
in  operating profit margins were negatively affected by a million reserve for fixed asset impairment  primarily as a result of the re engineering of our wafer production lines 
during the year  we took advantage of opportunities to purchase more efficient equipment at discounts 
as a result  we retired un depreciated equipment that was replaced 
management does not expect to see material equipment write downs in the coming quarters 

table of contents net interest expense for decreased  to  from million in  due primarily to a decrease in the use the company s credit facilities  as well as lower interest rates 
in  the company paid down million on its long term debt  reducing the balance  net of current portion from million to million 
other expense for increased  compared to last year  primarily due to the discontinuance of income diodes fabtech was receiving from an external company s use of its testing facilities in  a decrease in high technology grant income received at diodes china in  and currency exchange losses primarily in asia in  partly offset by a severance payment as per a separation agreement in  as well as the reduction in the expense recorded for the management incentive agreement at diodes fabtech in the effective tax rate in was compared to in  due primarily to a higher proportion of income earned by our asian subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions 
the company is benefiting from its diodes hong kong subsidiary  established last year  not only due to its lower tax rates  but also as another entry point into the asia market 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of million for the year  compared to million for included in the tax provision in is  in deferred taxes recorded for a portion of the earnings at diodes china  and  for a portion of the earnings at diodes hong kong 
the minority interest in joint venture represents the minority investor s share of the diodes china joint venture s income for the period

the joint venture investment is eliminated in consolidation of the company s financial statements  and the activities of diodes china are included therein 
as of december   the company had a controlling interest in the joint venture 
the company generated net income of million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in  as compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for this increase is due primarily to the sales increase at gross profit margins of compared to gross profit margins of in year compared to year net sales for increased million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to a increase in units sold as a result of increased demand for the company s products  as well as an easing of pricing pressures 
average selling prices in decreased approximately for discrete products and for wafer products 
gross profit for increased to million from million for of the million increase  million was due to the increase in gross profit margin from in to in  while million was due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit increases for wafer products was the primary contributor to the gross profit increase in gross profit in was adversely affected by higher fixed costs associated with the company s wafer fabrication facility  reduced capacity utilization at both the wafer facility and the china manufacturing facility  as well as by demand induced product mix changes and inventory pricing adjustments at distributors related to lower market prices 
for  sg a increased million to million from million for the increase in sg a was due primarily to higher sales commissions associated with the increase in sales  and higher wages and benefits expenses 
sg a also increased due to higher corporate and administrative expenses  including insurance expense partly offset by reduced goodwill amortization expense per the new accounting pronouncements 
sg a  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for from in r d increased to million  or of sales  in from  or of sales  in r d expenses are primarily related to new product development at the silicon wafer level 
net interest expense for decreased  to million from million in  due primarily to a decrease in the use the company s credit facilities 
in  the company paid down its credit facilities by million  from million to million

the minority interest in joint venture represents the minority investor s share of the diodes china joint venture s income for the period 
the increase in the joint venture earnings for is primarily the result of increased gross profit margins due to increased capacity utilization 
as of december   the company had a controlling interest in the joint venture 
the company generated net income of million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in  as compared to  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for this million increase is due primarily to the sales increase at gross profit margins of compared to gross profit margins of in financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise from the funding of its working capital needs  primarily inventory  work in process and accounts receivable  as well as capital expenditures 
the company s primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities and borrowings from principal stockholders 
any withdrawal of support from its banks or principal stockholders could have adverse consequences on the company s liquidity 
the company s liquidity depends  in part  on customers paying within credit terms  and any extended delays in payments or changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on the company s cash flow 
in addition  any abnormal product returns or pricing adjustments may also affect the company s source of short term funding 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities in were depreciation and amortization of million and net income of million 
the primary sources in were depreciation and amortization of million and net income of million 
the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities in were a decrease in inventories of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was a decrease in accrued liabilities of million and an increase in deferred income taxes of million 
for the year ended december   accounts receivable increased compared to the increase in sales as days sales outstanding increased from to days due primarily to a trend in longer payments terms  primarily from far east customers as well as major distributors 
the company continues to closely monitor its credit terms  while at times providing extended terms  required primarily by far east customers 
the ratio of the company s current assets to current liabilities on december  was to  compared to a ratio of to and to as of december  and  respectively 
cash used by investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in the primary investments were for additional manufacturing equipment and expansion at the diodes china manufacturing facility  as well as for the fabtech acquisition payments in on december   the company purchased all the outstanding capital stock of fabtech incorporated  a inch wafer foundry located in lee s summit  missouri from lite on semiconductor corporation lsc  the company s largest stockholder 
the acquisition purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash plus fabtech was obligated to repay an aggregate of approximately million of debt  consisting of i approximately million note payable to lsc  ii approximately million note payable to the company  and iii approximately million note payable to a financial institution which was repaid on december  with the proceeds of a capital contribution by the company 
the acquisition was financed internally and through bank credit facilities 

table of contents in june  according to the company s us bank covenants  diodes fabtech was not permitted to make regularly scheduled principal and interest payments to lsc on the remaining million payable related to the fabtech acquisition note  but was  however  able to renegotiate with lsc the terms of the note 
under the terms of the amended and restated subordinated promissory note  payments of approximately  plus interest were scheduled to begin again in july  provided the company met the terms of its us bank s covenants 
in may  the company renegotiated the terms of the note with lsc to extend the payment period from two years to four years  and accordingly  payments of approximately  plus interest began in july cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash used by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
the primary source of cash in was the receipt of million from stock option exercises 
at december   the company s total bank credit facility of million encompasses one major us bank  three banks in mainland china and five in taiwan 
as of december   the total credit lines were million  million  and million  for the us facility secured by substantially all assets  the unsecured chinese facilities  and the unsecured taiwanese facilities  respectively 
as of december   the available credit was million  million  and million  for the us facility  the chinese facilities  and the taiwanese facilities  respectively 
in february  the company and its us bank renewed its million revolving credit line  extending it for two years  and obtained an additional million credit facility to be used for capital expenditure requirements at its wafer fabrication facility 
the credit agreements have certain covenants and restrictions  which  among other matters  require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and operating results  as defined in the agreements  and prohibit the payment of dividends 
the company was in compliance with its covenants as of december the company has used its credit facilities primarily to fund the capacity expansion at diodes china and to a lesser extent diodes fabtech  as well as for the fabtech acquisition  and to support all operations 
the company believes that the continued availability of these credit facilities  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet the company s current foreseeable operating cash requirements 
in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major us bank which expires november   to hedge its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to of its long term debt 
the interest rate under the swap agreement is fixed at and is based on the notional amount 
the swap contract is inversely correlated to the related hedged long term debt and is therefore considered an effective cash flow hedge of the underlying long term debt 
the level of effectiveness of the hedge is measured by the changes in the market value of the hedged long term debt resulting from fluctuation in interest rates 
during and  variable interest rates decreased resulting in an interest rate swap liability of  as of december  as a matter of policy  the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
total working capital increased to million as of december   from million as of december  the company believes that such working capital position will be sufficient for foreseeable operations and growth opportunities 
the company s total debt to equity ratio improved to at december   from at december  it is anticipated that this ratio may increase should the company use its credit facilities to fund additional inventory sourcing opportunities 
the company has no material plans or commitments for capital expenditures other than in connection with manufacturing expansion at diodes china  diodes fabtech equipment requirements  and the company s implementation of an erp computer system 
however  to ensure that the company can secure reliable and cost effective inventory sourcing to support and better position itself for growth  the company is continuously evaluating additional internal manufacturing expansion  as well as additional outside sources of products 
the company believes its financial position will provide sufficient funds should an appropriate investment opportunity arise and thereby  assist the company in improving customer satisfaction and in maintaining or increasing market share 
based upon plans for new product introductions  product mixes  capacity restraints on certain product lines and equipment upgrades  the company anticipates that year capital expenditures for the manufacturing facilities will be million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that will affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  nor do we engage in leasing  hedging except for the interest rate swap agreement  or research and development services  that could expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table represents the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years long term debt    capital leases   operating leases     total obligations      inflation did not have a material effect on net sales or net income in fiscal years through a significant increase in inflation could affect future performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia 
the company s foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon the company s financial results 
certain of the company s assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar  the japanese yen  and the hong kong dollar 
because of the relatively small size and nature of each individual currency exposure  the company does not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
therefore  the company could experience currency gains and losses 
during the asian financial crisis  the chinese government resisted devaluing the renminbi rmb chinese currency 
china is again faced with international pressure demanding the appreciation of the rmb 
should the chinese government allow a significant rmb appreciation  and the company not take appropriate means to offset this exposure  the effect could have an adverse impact upon the company s financial results 
interest rate risk 
the company has credit agreements with us and far east financial institutions at interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a significant rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon the company s cost of working capital and its interest expense 
in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
the interest rate swap agreement applies to million of the company s long term debt at december  and expires november  the swap contract is inversely correlated to the related hedged long term debt and is therefore considered an effective cash flow hedge of the underlying long term debt 
the level of effectiveness of the hedge is measured by the changes in the market value of the hedged long term debt resulting from fluctuation in interest rates 
as a matter of policy  the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
political risk 
the company has approximately of its assets in mainland china  taiwan and hong kong at december  the possibility of political conflict between the two countries or with the united states could have an adverse impact upon the company s ability to transact business through these important business segments and to generate profits
