general introduction in may  the company changed its business model by licensing the candie s and bongo trademarks for footwear to steven madden and kcp  respectively  effectively eliminating the company s operations as they related to the production and distribution of women s and girl s footwear 
in conjunction with the elimination of its footwear operations  the company closed all of its retail stores during fiscal the company remains in the business of manufacturing  distributing  selling and marketing jeans wear under the bongo label through its unzipped division  as well as the marketing and sale of a variety of men s outdoor boots and casual shoes under private label brands through bright star 
the company s management agreement with sweet along with the supply and distribution agreements with azteca and ads  respectively  all expire on january  consistent with the company s current licensing structure  the company anticipates that on or before january  it will license the rights to bongo jeanswear to a third party licensee 
as a result of the company s transitions to a licensing business  the company s operating results are not comparable to prior years 
further  since there will be no net sales attributable to wholesale and retail footwear activities in fiscal and thereafter as a result of the company s transition to a licensing business the results for fiscal and are also expected to be non comparable to fiscal and prior years 
critical accounting policies during fiscal  the company adopted certain new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  as described below and summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these new accounting standards did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in fiscal several of the company s accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for the collectibility of accounts receivable and the recovery value of inventory 
for accounts receivable  the company estimates the net collectibility considering historical  current and anticipated trends of co op advertising deductions  operational deductions taken by customers  markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of customers 
for inventory  the company estimates the amount of goods that it will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and writes down the value of these goods to the recovery value expected to be realized through price reductions and close outs 
of the consolidated group  only unzipped  the company wholly owned bongo jeans wear subsidiary is subject to inventory risk 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any adjustments when necessary 
revenue is recognized upon shipment with related risk and title passing to the customers 
estimates of losses for bad debts  returns and other allowances are recorded at the time of the sale 
the company has entered into various trade name license agreements that provide revenues based on minimum royalties and additional revenues based on a percentage of defined sales 
minimum royalty revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over each period  as defined  in each license agreement 
royalties exceeding the defined minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee s sales 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon the company s adoption of sfas no 
on february   the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
as prescribed under sfas no 
 the company had goodwill tested for impairment during fiscal  and no impairments were necessary 
impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

in addition  sweet guarantees that the net income  as defined  of unzipped shall be no less than million for each year during the term commencing in fiscal the guarantee 
in the event that the guarantee is not met  sweet is obligated to pay the difference between the actual net income  as defined and the guarantee the shortfall payment see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended january   unzipped had a net income as defined  for the purpose of determining if guarantee has been met of  resulting in a shortfall payment of million 
this payment has been recorded in the consolidated income statements as a reduction of unzipped s cost of sales and on the balance sheet as a reduction of the senior subordinated note due to sweet  as provided for in the management agreement 
after adjusting for the shortfall payment  unzipped s reported gaap net income for the year ended january  was million 
in connection with the acquisition of unzipped  the company agreed to file and have declared effective a registration statement with the sec for the million shares of the company s common stock issued to sweet 
the terms of this agreement provided that in the event the registration statement was not declared effective by april   the company would be required to pay  to sweet as a penalty and thereafter be required to pay  per calendar quarter for each calendar quarter thereafter in which the registration statement is not effective for more than days of such calendar quarter 
since the registration statement was not declared effective until july   the company was required to pay  to sweet as a penalty 
the company recorded  expense for such penalty in the quarter ended april  current revolving credit facility 
on january   the company entered into a three year million credit facility the credit facility with cit commercial services 
borrowings under the credit facility are formula based and originally included a million over advance provision with interest at above the prime rate 
in june  the company agreed to amend the credit facility to increase the over advance provision to million and include certain retail inventory in the availability formula 
borrowings under the amended credit facility bore interest at above the prime rate 
at january   there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility which was terminated by an agreement dated january  unzipped had a credit facility with congress financial corporation congress 
under the facility as amended  unzipped was entitled to borrow up to million under revolving loans until september  the facility was further amended to extend its expiration on a month to month basis through january  borrowings under the facility were limited by advance rates against eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances  as defined 
the borrowings under the facility bore interest at the lender s prime rate or at a rate of per annum in excess of the eurodollar rate 
on february  unzipped entered into a two year million credit facility the unzipped credit facility with ge capital commercial services  inc geccs replacing its arrangement with congress 
borrowings are limited by advance rates against eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances  as defined 
under the facility  unzipped may also arrange for letters of credit in an amount up to million 
the borrowings bear interest at a rate of per annum in excess of the day commercial paper rate or  whichever is greater 
borrowings under the unzipped credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of unzipped 
in addition  unzipped has agreed to subordinate its accounts payable to azteca  ads and sweet to geccs 
unzipped is also required to meet a minimum tangible net worth covenant  as defined 
at january   unzipped s borrowings totaled million under the revolving credit agreement and the availability under the formula was million 
unzipped is in default of certain covenants under the unzipped credit facility  including the tangible net worth covenant 
as of may   unzipped had not obtained a waiver for these defaults and there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
as a result  the lender could  in addition to other possible remedies  reduce the advance rates  cease advancing funds  or demand immediate repayment of the outstanding loan amount which was approximately million as of april   any of which could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of unzipped 
while the company believes that it is unlikely that the lender would accelerate unzipped s obligations under the unzipped credit facility  in the event that it did so  unzipped would not be able to immediately repay the existing loan balance  which could result in the lender foreclosing on unzipped s assets  among other remedies 
in the event that the lender forecloses on the unzipped credit facility  the company believes  based on unzipped s current financial condition  that unzipped would have more than sufficient assets and net worth to allow the lender to recoup its entire loan  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
an acceleration of the unzipped credit facility would impact the operating results and financial condition of unzipped in fiscal including a possible write off or impairment of assets  which could result in a reduction in the company s consolidated revenues in fiscal sweet  the manager of unzipped  has guaranteed that the net income of unzipped  as defined in the management agreement  in fiscal shall be no less than million and the company believes that this guarantee is enforceable even in the event of foreclosure or acceleration of the unzipped credit facility 
additionally  candie s  inc  the parent of unzipped  is not a signatory or a guarantor of the unzipped credit facility and would not be liable for unzipped s obligations thereunder 
the company also believes that it has sufficient liquidity from revenues generated from its licensing and men s private label activity  which are separate from unzipped  as well as from the additional borrowing obtained under the iph bond financing see bond financing  to satisfy the company s anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company anticipates that on or before january   it will license the rights to bongo jeans wear to a third party licensee  which would provide the company with additional licensing revenues commencing upon signing an agreement 
unzipped currently has a royalty free non exclusive sublicense for bongo jeans wear 
bond financing 
in august iph  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  issued in a private placement million of asset backed notes secured by intellectual property assets tradenames  trademarks and license payments thereon 
the notes have a year term with a fixed interest rate of with quarterly principal and interest payments of approximately  the notes are subject to a liquidity reserve account of million  funded by a deposit of a portion of the proceeds of the notes 
the net proceeds of million were used to reduce amounts due by the company under its existing revolving credit facilities 
costs incurred to obtain this financing totaled approximately million which have been deferred and are being amortized over the life of the debt 
at january   the unamortized portion of such costs were million 
subsequent to january   iph amended the asset backed notes whereby it borrowed an additional million 
the additional borrowing matures in august  with a floating interest rate of libor  with quarterly principal and interest payments and  of interest prepaid at closing 
the net proceeds of million will be used for general working capital purposes 
costs incurred to obtain this financing totaling approximately  will be deferred and amortized over the life of the debt 
the company s cash requirements fluctuate from time to time due to  among other factors  seasonal requirements  including the timing of receipt of merchandise 
the company believes that it will be able to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements for the foreseeable future  primarily with cash flow from operations  and borrowings under the unzipped credit facility 
however  if the company s plans change or its assumptions prove to be incorrect  it could be required to obtain additional capital that may not be available to it on acceptable terms  or at all 
the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of january   and is based on information appearing in the notes to consolidated financial statements amounts in thousands contractual obligations total after notes payable   long term debt      operating leases total contractual cash obligations      seasonality the company s quarterly results may fluctuate quarter to quarter as a result of its licensees businesses as well as a result of holidays  weather  the timing of product shipments  market acceptance of company products  the mix  pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold  the hiring and training of personnel  the timing of inventory write downs  fluctuations in the cost of materials  the mix between wholesale and licensing businesses  and the incurrence of operating costs beyond the company s control as may be caused general economic conditions  and other unpredictable factors such as the action of competitors 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
in addition  the timing of the receipt of future revenues could be impacted by the recent trend among retailers in the company s industry to order goods closer to a particular selling season than they have historically done so 
the company continues to seek to expand and diversify its product lines under license to help reduce the dependence on any particular product line and lessen the impact of the seasonal nature of its business 
the success of the company  however  will still largely remain dependent on its and its licensees ability to contract with and retain key licensees  to predict accurately upcoming fashion trends among its customer base  to build and maintain brand awareness and to fulfill the product requirements of the retail channel within the shortened timeframe required 
unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the united states economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  among other factors noted herein  could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s products are marketed primarily for fall and spring seasons  with slightly higher volumes of products sold during the second fiscal quarter 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the past few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
net operating loss carry forwards at january   the company had available net operating losses of approximately million for income tax purposes  which expire in the years through because of ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code occurring in previous fiscal years  the utilization of approximately million of the net operating losses is limited to  per year and expires in the years through the remaining million is not subject to such limitation and expires through included in the nol is million as of january  from the exercises of stock options  the benefit of the utilization of this nol will go into additional paid in capital

the company s earnings may also be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under the unzipped credit facility 
a change in interest rates of two percentage points or less would not materially effect the company s fiscal and fiscal net losses
