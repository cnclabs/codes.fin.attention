item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding the termination of the metron technology distribution agreements 
industry background the complex process of fabricating semiconductor devices involves several distinct phases that are repeated numerous times 
because each production phase typically requires different processing technologies and equipment  no one semiconductor equipment supplier currently produces all of the types 
table of contents of tools needed to equip an entire state of the art fabrication facility 
instead  semiconductor device manufacturers typically equip their facilities by combining manufacturing equipment produced by a number of suppliers 
each set of equipment performs specific functions in the manufacturing process 
generally the need for new processes  larger substrates the underlying material silicon wafer upon which a semiconductor device or integrated circuit is formed and systems capable of manufacturing increasingly complex devices drives demand for new microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes 
industries that use microelectronics increasingly demand higher performance devices from manufacturers 
over the last decade  device manufacturers have reduced the size and substantially increased the functionality of individual devices through a number of technological advances 
our business depends upon the microelectronics manufacturers capital equipment expenditures 
manufacturers expenditures in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for products that use microelectronic devices 
the microelectronics industry has been cyclical in nature and has experienced periodic downturns 
microelectronics manufacturers require equipment suppliers to take an increasingly active role in meeting the manufacturers technology capital productivity requirements 
equipment suppliers satisfy this requirement by developing and supporting products and processes required to address the new trends in microelectronics manufacturing 
these trends include development of smaller geometries  transition to new materials  migration to mm wafers and wafer level packaging 
a number of semiconductor device manufacturers began the transition from mm to mm diameter wafers in calendar based upon a report published in july by the gartner group  a leading industry market research firm  the percentages of investment in semiconductor process equipment allocated by semiconductor manufacturers to mm capable products were approximately in calendar  in calendar and in calendar semiconductor manufacturers investment in mm capable products is forecasted to be approximately of their total equipment spending in calendar and of their total equipment spending in calendar the semiconductor equipment industry has experienced a significant decline from calendar through according to the gartner group  purchases of semiconductor equipment by microelectronics manufacturers decreased from billion in calendar to billion in calendar based upon the most recent gartner group forecast  the semiconductor equipment industry is expected to grow approximately percent in calendar products the mix of products we sell has varied significantly from year to year 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the amount of revenues and approximate percentages of our total revenues by our principal product lines fiscal year ended august  august  august  dollars in thousands surface conditioning products pss products spare parts and service surface conditioning products our surface conditioning products perform certain front end of line feol fabrication steps  where integrated circuits or transistors are formed in and on the silicon wafer during the manufacturing process  
table of contents back end of line beol fabrication steps  where metal wiring levels are formed on the surface of the wafer and are connected to the transistors  and wafer level packaging surface preparation  including cleaning  etching and stripping functions necessary to fabricate solder bumps or other terminal structures needed to connect the chip to the circuit board 
spray processing systems 
our spray processing systems  which include the mercury and zeta surface conditioning systems  are sophisticated spray chemistry systems that clean  etch and strip away unwanted films and contaminations from the surfaces of semiconductor wafers at various stages in the microelectronic device fabrication process 
multiple cassettes that contain up to wafers each are placed onto a turntable inside the system s process chamber 
as the turntable rotates  nozzles apply a chemical spray to the wafers surfaces to dissolve and remove the undesirable films and contaminants 
after chemical application  deionized water is sprayed on the wafer surfaces to rinse away the chemicals 
multiple chemical and rinse steps may be employed depending on the customer s specific application 
the process sequence is completed with a dry step where the centrifugal force from the rotation  combined with a flow of nitrogen into the chamber dries the wafers and the chamber 
our sophisticated microprocessor based control system and chemical mixing manifold allows the user to define  control and monitor a variety of chemical mixtures  temperatures and sequences 
this enables the user to rapidly develop new processes and utilize the systems for multiple applications 
the mercury system is a semi automated batch spray processor designed for wafer sizes up to mm in diameter and process technologies through the nanometers nm node 
the system offers the benefits of low capital cost and low cost of ownership in a small footprint 
the mercury system ranges in price from  to  depending on features and customer specific add ons 
the fully automated zeta surface conditioning system  a batch spray processor  is currently available in configurations for both mm and mm wafers 
the advanced process controls  process capability and automation are ideal for leading technology nodes  particularly nm and below 
the zeta products provide a reliable  automated environment to move wafers to and from the process chamber 
this tool s eight chemical flow system allows for a wide range of chemical blend ratios 
in subsequent generations of the zeta system  we improved tool capabilities through a significant footprint reduction and expanded the range of process applications in both feol and beol 
the zeta system with the flashclean tm advantage package  consisting of hardware  software and process advancements  further enhances system productivity and performance by shortening process time and increasing throughput 
the zeta system is also available in a semi automated configuration capable of processing either mm  mm or mm wafers 
our zeta systems range in price from  to  in response to customers that desire more environmentally benign processes  we supply an ozonated water generation module for use with our magellan  zeta and mercury systems 
our ozone based resist stripping and cleaning technologies utilize our patented and patent pending high concentration ozonated water generation process and dynamic chemical processing 
the use of ozone in semiconductor processing is attractive because it uses only oxygen and water in the place of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide mixtures 
not only does it eliminate environmentally harmful and potentially dangerous chemical mixtures  it also lowers costs by reducing chemical consumption  water usage and waste treatment 
vapor processing systems 
our excalibur vapor hf etching systems use anhydrous hydrogen fluoride hf gas in conjunction with water vapor to perform selective oxide etching applications 
the semi automated system is available for mm through mm wafers 
the system processes wafers individually  loading them from the wafer carrier into the process chamber by an automated handler to minimize particle contamination 
vapor hf processing offers advantages over processing systems using liquid chemicals  including providing unique high selective etch capabilities 
the high selectivity allows the removal of undesired oxides while etching little or none of the desired films 
this capability is unique to the excalibur vapor hf process and provides customers with the means to create device features not readily manufacturable by other methods 
the excalibur system ranges 
table of contents in price from  to  depending on the model  wafer size  number of process chambers and related electronic control requirements 
cryokinetic processing systems 
through a license agreement with ibm  we manufacture  market  and service products using ibm s cryogenic aerosol cleaning technology 
our cryokinetic clean is an energy transfer process used to remove non chemically bonded particles from the surface of a microelectric device 
the process is dry and non reactive using frozen argon nitrogen aerosols to remove yield limiting surface particles through momentum transfer  when the high velocity aerosols impact the particles 
the gas flow carries contaminants away from the wafer and removes them from the process chamber 
the antares cx advanced cleaning system is for mm and mm single wafer  fully automated processing 
the antares cx system removes surface particles to increase device yields 
these particles can be either process defects or fab contamination from sensitive new materials  such as copper and low k dielectric films 
low k dielectric film is a material used as insulation between interconnects for beol semiconductor manufacturing applications 
because low k dielectric films can be porous  a dry method such as the cryokinetic technology is especially attractive because it does not alter material properties 
this technology is an effective replacement for existing scrubber technology 
the antares system is also available with the aspectclean tm process  a method of removing defects from feol and beol patterned structures without altering film properties or physically damaging the structures  which is becoming more critical in nm production ramps 
traditional methods of defect reduction have been phased out due to damage issues  where as this process is demonstrating high removal efficiency on sensitive narrow structures without causing damage 
antares cx systems range in price from  to  immersion processing systems 
with our acquisition of yieldup international in october  we expanded into the critical cleaning segment of the surface conditioning market through immersion processing 
immersion processing is a method used to clean silicon wafers by immersing the wafer in multiple tanks filled with process chemicals 
in june  we introduced the magellan immersion clean system and in august  released a mm version 
with this product  we expanded our immersion processing solutions by providing a system capable of multiple  mainstream cleans  including critical clean  resist strip and etch 
the magellan system is a fully automated immersion cleaning system designed for processing of both mm and mm wafers at advanced technology nodes 
it is differentiated from the competition through rapid cycle time  flexibility and high performance in a footprint that is up to smaller than the leading competition when configured for specific applications 
the tool incorporates an extensive portfolio of exclusive intellectual property  including our surface tension gradient stg rinse dry technology  symflow tm etch technology  ozone oxide re growth and narrow gate compatible megasonic technology 
we shipped our first domestic demonstration system in december in august  we shipped a demonstration system to a korean customer and delivered a magellan system for process development to our japanese affiliate  m fsi 
the magellan system ranges in price from  to  during fiscal  magellan process development and tool qualification activities have been conducted at a customer site and in our chaska  minnesota based laboratory 
since september  m fsi has been conducting additional development work in its okayama  japan process laboratory 
the magellan system is qualified for a number of processes including feol critical clean  feol photoresist strip and post ash clean  oxide etch and nitride etch 
the yieldup system is a rinsing and drying system that delivers nm capable watermark free performance in a stand alone platform 
originally designed for mm wafer processing  its capabilities have been expanded to serve smaller wafers as well 
the yieldup module is also available for integration into a wet bench system 
the yieldup system is a two chamber etching  rinsing and drying system that provides integrated hydrofluoric acid etching 
yieldup immersion systems range in price from  to  see item legal proceedings for additional information on our ability to sell yieldup modules 

table of contents pss products our pss products are microlithography products used to deposit photoresist  which is light sensitive  etch resistant material used to transfer an image to the surface of a silicon wafer  or insulating films onto the surface of a wafer and develop the photosensitive films 
following our announcement on march  to exit the resist process equipment market  we discontinued our active manufacture and sale of these products and established the pss business to provide key support services to our global polaris customer base 
pss offers software maintenance  process applications support  engineering and equipment maintenance 
customer s robot refurbishment  system level and standard upgrades  systems operations and maintenance training and spare parts 
refresh program tm  in which customers can purchase certified polaris clusters made of both new and pre owned  re qualified modules

these upgrade and spare part packages and support service programs enable our worldwide customers to realize a higher return on their capital investment 
we sell a variety of process  service and maintenance programs 
a number of customers have purchased maintenance contracts in which our service employees work at the customer s facility to provide process service and maintenance support for our equipment 
backlog and seasonality our backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer s purchase order has been received 
our backlog at fiscal year end was million  of which related to sc products and related to the pss products 
our backlog at fiscal year end was million  of which related to sc products and related to pss products 
approximately of our backlog at fiscal year end and of our backlog at fiscal year end was comprised of orders from two customers for each year 
samsung and intel were the top two customers in backlog at the end of fiscal texas instruments and sandia national labs were the top two customers in our backlog at the end of fiscal the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
all orders are subject to cancellation by the customer and in some cases a penalty provision could apply to a cancellation 
in fiscal  purchase orders aggregating approximately million  constituting of sales  were canceled and not rescheduled 
in fiscal  purchase orders aggregating approximately million  constituting of sales  were canceled and not rescheduled 
because of the timing and relative size of certain orders received by us and possible changes in delivery schedules and order cancellations  our backlog can vary from time to time so that backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any subsequent period 
our business is not seasonal to any significant extent 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional sales and backlog information 

table of contents research and development we believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to enhance  in collaboration with our customers and other equipment and materials manufacturers  our existing sc product lines to meet the changing needs of microelectronics manufacturers 
we believe that industry trends  such as the use of smaller circuit geometries  increased use of larger substrates and manufacturers increased desire for integrated processing equipment  will make highly automated and integrated systems  including single substrate processing systems  more important to customers 
for assistance in our development efforts  we maintain relationships with our customers and others  who help identify and analyze industry trends and our development activities to meet the industry s advanced technology needs 
our current research and development programs are focused on the need for cleaner substrate surfaces due to smaller geometries  increased process control and flexibility through monitoring and software management systems and process automation  robotics automation in the cleanroom  and integration of our product offerings with other suppliers products 
each of these programs involves customer and other equipment manufacturers collaboration to ensure proper machine configuration and process development to meet industry requirements 
we maintain an  square foot  state of the art demonstration and process development laboratory for our surface conditioning business in our chaska  minnesota facility 
in addition  our japanese affiliate  m fsi  ltd  maintains a demonstration laboratory in its okayama  japan facility 
expenditures for research and development  which are expensed as incurred  during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales 
expenditures for research and development during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales  and expenditures for research and development during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales 
the fiscal to fiscal decline relates primarily to our decision to exit the resist processing market in march we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
we also recognize the importance of managing product transitions successfully  as the introduction of new products could adversely affect sales of existing products 
marketing  sales and support we market our products worldwide to manufacturers of microelectronic devices 
our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long term relationships with our customers 
these efforts are supported by marketing  sales  and service personnel  along with process and applications engineers that work closely with individual customers to find solutions to their needs 
on october   we announced the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology  effective march  this change occurred as a result of our customers asking us to strengthen our presence in these regions and to bring them the full capabilities of our organization 
we worked closely with metron technology to ensure a successful transition of sales  applications  service and spares logistical functions 
our direct sales and service support employees worked with customers to understand their processing requirements and to configure our equipment to provide applications solutions to meet those requirements 
as of the end of fiscal  our sales effort was supported by approximately employees and contractors engaged in customer service and support 
during fiscal  our products were directly sold and serviced by us in north america  europe and the asia pacific region  and through our joint venture  m fsi  ltd  in japan 
the only exception is israel  which is represented by the distribution company metron technology  nv see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding the termination of the metron technology distribution agreements and the transitioning of our sales and service efforts 
we believe as a result of our direct selling and service initiative  we are experiencing broader product adoption in europe and the asia pacific region 
by providing a full portfolio of direct support services  we have developed stronger customer relationships and our customers are beginning to show greater interest in 
table of contents expanding beyond their use of fsi traditional spray cleaning technologies to include new beol and wafer bumping applications for spray  as well as employing our advanced immersion and cryokinetic technologies 
our increased responsiveness on the local level has resulted in more productive collaborative efforts and joint development programs with integrated circuit makers throughout the world for both nm production and nm development projects 
international sales  primarily in europe  the asia pacific region and japan accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal  of total sales in fiscal  and of total sales in fiscal as of august   we held approximately million shares of metron technology stock or approximately of the outstanding shares 
metron technology has an extensive distribution organization located in europe  israel  india  and in the asia pacific region  and sells materials and equipment on behalf of several semiconductor equipment and consumables manufacturers 
on august   metron technology entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement purchase agreement with applied materials  inc applied  pursuant to which applied has agreed to acquire the worldwide operating subsidiaries and business of metron technology 
in connection with the purchase agreement  in order to induce applied to enter into the purchase agreement  applied and certain shareholders of metron the shareholders  including fsi  entered into voting agreements and proxies  dated august  the voting agreements 
pursuant to the voting agreements  each of the shareholders  including fsi  irrevocably appointed the directors of applied as such shareholder s lawful attorneys and proxies with respect to certain prescribed matters related to the transaction 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  applied has agreed to pay approximately  in cash to metron technology for all outstanding shares of metron technology s worldwide operating subsidiaries and substantially all of the other assets of metron technology  and assume certain metron technology liabilities 
based on information provided by metron technology  the acquisition  which is subject to regulatory and metron technology shareholder approval and other closing conditions  is expected to close before the end of calendar according to metron technology  following the close of the proposed acquisition  metron technology plans to announce cash distributions to its shareholders in the range of approximately to per share depending on the tax attributes of the metron technology shareholders  which are expected to be made in at least two cash distributions during the six month period following the close of the transaction 
in connection with the final cash distribution to its shareholders  metron technology also expects to conclude its business  delist its shares from nasdaq and be dissolved and liquidated 
we expect to record a to million gain on the sale of these shares of metron technology 
we own a equity interest in m fsi  ltd  a japanese joint venture company formed in with mbk project holdings ltd 
formerly mitsui co  ltd 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  chlorine engineers corp  ltd 
collectively  mitsui 
mitsui owns a equity interest in m fsi 
in connection with its formation  we and mitsui granted m fsi certain product and technology licenses and product distribution rights pursuant to a license agreement and a distribution agreement 
in september  m fsi granted fsi exclusive rights to distribute certain products outside of japan and an exclusive license covering the patents and related technology with regard to certain products for use outside of japan 
in fiscal year  the majority of our international sales were made to metron technology or m fsi for resale to end users of our products 
in addition to metron technology prior to the termination of our distribution agreements and m fsi having a direct presence in europe  asia and japan  we augmented their support to customers with several sales and service personnel located in the regions 
in some cases  we also sold directly to an international customer  in which case we paid a commission to our affiliated distributor in connection with the sale 
when commissions are taken into account  the international sales to our affiliates are on terms generally no less favorable to us than international sales by us directly to non affiliates 

table of contents manufacturing  raw materials and suppliers we maintain manufacturing facilities in chaska  minnesota and allen  texas 
we plan to sell our allen  texas manufacturing facility related to our pss business during fiscal we typically assemble our products and systems from components and prefabricated parts manufactured and supplied by others  such as process controllers  robots  integrated circuits  power supplies  stainless steel pressure vessels  chamber bowls  valves and relays 
certain of the items manufactured by others are made to our specifications 
typically  final assembly and systems tests are performed by our manufacturing personnel 
quality control is maintained through quality assurance programs with suppliers  incoming inspection of components  in process inspection during equipment assembly  and final inspection and operation of manufactured equipment prior to shipment 
we have a company wide quality program in place and received iso certification in certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers to ensure overall quality and delivery timeliness 
although we seek to reduce dependence on sole and limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of certain of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on our operations 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products  if necessary  but that production delays would likely occur in some cases 
further  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have an adverse effect on our operating results  delay scheduled deliveries and result in damage to customer relationships 
competition in each of our regional markets we face intense competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  research  development  manufacturing  marketing  service and support resources 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in research and development  marketing  and customer service and support  and manage our operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that our products will continue to be viewed as competitive as a result of technological advances by competitors or changes in semiconductor technology 
our competitors also may increase their efforts to gain and retain market share through competitive pricing  strategic alliances or mergers and acquisitions 
such competitive pressures may require us to reduce prices or may result in lost orders that could adversely affect our financial results 
if our competitors enter into strategic alliances with leading semiconductor manufacturers in the areas of surface conditioning  this could impair our ability to sell our products and adversely affect our operating results 
significant competitive factors in the equipment market include system price  quality  process repeatability  capability and flexibility  ability to integrate with other products  process or tool of record  incumbency and overall cost of ownership  including reliability  automation  throughput  system price and customer support 
we have experienced significant price competition from certain competitors 
however  we believe that we have the strategies in place to develop technological advantages over our competitors 
to realize and maintain these advantages will require a continued high level of investment by us in research and development  marketing  and customer service and support as well as controlling operating expenses 
our surface conditioning products compete with  among others  dainippon screen manufacturing co 
ltd  kaijo denki  ses co  ltd  semitool  inc  scp global technologies  the sez group  akrion and tokyo electron ltd 
our pss organization competes with various small equipment refurbishment  equipment maintenance and spare parts providers 
customers we sell products from one or more of our product lines to most major microelectronics manufacturers 
we have an extensive history of sales to several of the largest integrated circuit manufacturers and we have over active customers worldwide 

table of contents texas instruments accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal  of our total sales in fiscal and of our total sales in fiscal ibm accounted for less than of our total sales in fiscal  approximately of our total sales in and approximately of our total sales in fiscal we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in our customer mix 
the timing of an order for our equipment is primarily dependent upon the customer s expansion program  replacement needs  or requirements to improve productivity and yields 
consequently  a customer who places significant orders in one year will not necessarily place significant orders in subsequent years 
sales to metron technology and m fsi  our international distributors  accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal  of our total sales in fiscal  and of our total sales in fiscal usually these systems are purchased for resale to device manufacturers 
on october   we announced the termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology effective march  metron technology continues to represent our products in israel 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding the termination of the metron technology distribution agreements 
under the m fsi distribution agreement  m fsi has exclusive distribution rights with respect to certain of our products in japan 
a licensing agreement allows m fsi to manufacture certain of our products 
the agreements may be terminated only upon the occurrence of certain events or conditions or as otherwise mutually agreed 
there is no obligation under the distribution agreement for m fsi to purchase a specified amount or percentage of our products 
in september  m fsi granted fsi exclusive rights to distribute certain products outside of japan and fsi was granted an exclusive license covering the patents and related technology with regard to certain m fsi products for use outside of japan 
patents  trademarks and intellectual property our success depends upon a variety of factors  including proprietary technology 
it is important to protect our technology by obtaining and enforcing patents 
consequently  we have an active program to file patent applications in the united states and other countries on inventions we consider significant 
we also possess other proprietary intellectual property  including trademarks  know how  trade secrets and copyrights 
we also protect our proprietary information through non disclosure agreements with our employees and with third parties 
we have a number of patents in the united states and other countries  and additional applications are pending 
these patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or may not provide any competitive advantages to us 
pending applications may not result in patents and the claims allowed in future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
the laws of some foreign countries may not permit the protection of our proprietary rights to the same extent as under the laws of the united states 
although we believe that protection afforded by our patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property rights has value  because of rapidly changing technology  our future success is primarily dependent on our employees engineering  marketing  service and manufacturing skills 
in the normal course of business  we from time to time receive and make inquiries about possible patent infringement 
in dealing with such inquiries  it may be necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights 
however  there can be no assurance that such license rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the inability to obtain certain license or other rights  or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation could have a material adverse effect on us

we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and have never been subject to a work stoppage 
we believe we have good relations with our employees 
environmental matters in january  we received our certificate of registration from bsi  inc for its iso environmental management system 
iso is an internationally recognized environmental management standard that empowers organizations to address the environmental impact of activities  services and processes 
the standard then provides a framework for enterprises to take steps to identify issues significant to them and implement environmental management programs to achieve improved performance 
registration with iso allows companies to reaffirm that environmental processes are essential components of their business strategy 
we have a long history of environmentally friendly practices and research and development programs that actively seek out ways to operate more environmentally efficient 
we registered with iso to emphasize our ongoing commitment to the preservation and protection of the environment  and to support existing environmental health and safety initiatives 
we implemented an enterprise wide program to actively engage our employees and to emphasize the importance of protecting the environment in everyday life at fsi 
our programs include recycling  water use reductions  chemical handling processes and equipment design for the environment 
we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing and product development process 
we believe we are in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes 
if we fail to comply with present or future regulations  fines could be imposed  production and product development could be suspended  or operations could cease 
such regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or take other actions to comply with environmental regulations at a potentially significant cost to us 
if we fail to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of  hazardous substances  we could incur future liabilities 
see also item legal proceedings for a discussion of our environmental legal proceedings

management believes its existing facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 
item legal proceedings we generate minor amounts of liquid and solid hazardous waste and use licensed haulers and disposal facilities to ship and dispose of such waste 
in the past  we have received notice from state or federal enforcement agencies that we are a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the investigation of several hazardous waste disposal sites owned and operated by third parties 
in each matter  we have elected to participate in settlement offers made to all de minimis parties with respect to such sites 
the risk of being named a prp is that if any of the other prp s are unable to contribute its proportionate share of the liability  if any  associated with the site  those prp s that are financially able could be held financially responsible for the shortfall 
there has and continues to be substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the microelectronics industry 
commercialization of new products or further commercialization of our current products could provoke claims of infringement by third parties 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of effort by us  which by itself could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
further  adverse determinations in such litigation could result in our loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling one or more products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our product lines are intended for use with hazardous chemicals 
as a result  we are notified by our customers from time to time of incidents involving our equipment that have resulted in a spill or release of a hazardous chemical 
in some cases it may be alleged that we or our equipment are at fault 
there can be no assurance that any future litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results

hsu was awarded an additional  for attorneys fees and expenses incurred since the judgment was rendered in november the total judgment against ssi together with post judgment interest and attorneys fees as of august  aggregated approximately million 
ssi and the individual defendants have filed an appeal on a variety of grounds and we posted an appeal bond on behalf of ssi and defendants in the amount of million 
as part of the posting of the bond  we entered into entered into a letter of credit of million with a surety company 
this letter of credit is collateralized with restricted cash of a similar amount 
we  on behalf of ssi  have made a claim with respect to the lawsuit under the escrow created at the time of our acquisition of ssi 
the escrow was established to secure certain indemnification obligations of the former shareholders of ssi 
the escrow consists of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock paid to the former shareholders of ssi as consideration in the acquisition 
the former shareholders have agreed to hold us and ssi harmless from any claim arising out of any securities transactions between ssi and the shareholders or former shareholders of ssi 
the indemnification obligations of the individual ssi shareholders are capped at approximately million in the aggregate 
any shares in the escrow returned to us to satisfy any indemnification obligations will be valued at per share  the per share price of our common stock at the time of the ssi acquisition 
given the escrowed shares and the additional indemnification by the individual ssi shareholders  along with our litigation reserve  we believe we are adequately reserved for this potential liability 
however  there is considerable uncertainty as to the ultimate resolution of this matter and the respective liability  if any  of ssi 
we will continue with our appeal process and our defense

cfm filed an additional complaint against yieldup in united states district court for the district of delaware on december  on january   mattson technology  inc mattson completed the merger of the semiconductor equipment division of steag electronic systems ag and cfm and established its wet products division 
with the merger completed  mattson assumed responsibility for the two suits cfm filed against yieldup 
then  on march   scp global technologies scp acquired the wet product division of mattson  including cfmt  inc  and assumed responsibility for the two lawsuits 
on february   fsi and scp announced that they settled the two patent infringement lawsuits pending in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
in an effort to settle these lawsuits  we acknowledged the validity and enforceability of the patents  but disputed that any of our products infringed upon the claims of the patents 
we agreed to pay scp million for a release from past infringement claims and a prospective license under all four patents asserted against us in the two lawsuits 
the release applies to all purchasers of our products containing its surface tension gradient stg technology 
the prospective license applies to all end user customers of our products subject to certain limitations 
in addition  we agreed to supply scp customers  at a pre established price  our rinse dry kits to implement its stg technology for certain applications 
we made an initial payment of million on march  and will make additional payments of  on both the first and second anniversaries of the effective date of the settlement agreement

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies and estimates in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically product warranty  inventory reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts and assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if our equipment sales involve sales to our existing customers who have previously accepted the same type s of equipment with the same type s of specifications  we account for the product sale as a multiple element arrangement 
we recognize the equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title 
the other elements may include installation and training 
equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete an installation and published or quoted service labor rates and is recognized when the labor has been completed 
training revenue is valued based on published training class prices and is recognized when the customers complete the training classes or when a customer specific training period has expired 
the published or quoted service labor rates and training class prices are rates actually charged and billed to our customers 
all other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance 
future revenues may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet customer specific acceptance criteria 
revenue related to spare part sales is recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
timing and amount of revenue recognized is dependent on the mix of revenue recognized upon shipment versus acceptance and for revenue recognized upon acceptance  it is dependent upon when customer specific criteria are met 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we do determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model or another valuation technique 
net intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of august  in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
as of august   we performed our initial evaluation of our goodwill for any indication of impairment 
as of that date  our market capitalization was approximately  this fair value was allocated to our two reporting units based on relative cash flows 
as of august   there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
subsequent to august   the world experienced the tragedy 
this caused economic uncertainty and delayed capital equipment purchases by many of our customers 
approximately six months after the tragedy  certain semiconductor manufacturers  including our customers  started to realize improved demand for their products 
at about the same time  we  along with a number of our peer companies  started to experience more positive order activity 
this overall electronics industry recovery turned out to be unsustainable as we approached summer this change in industry conditions had a negative impact on our market capitalization and our financial performance  including cash flows 
our market capitalization went from  as of august  to  as of august   the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
we reviewed for impairment of goodwill according to the guidelines of sfas and  based upon the analysis  we deemed goodwill impaired 
as a result  we recorded a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents the decrease in our market capitalization  the continued downturn in the electronics industry and the overall global economic conditions  all contributed to the impairment of our goodwill as of the end of fiscal our investment in our affiliate  metron technology  was accounted for by the equity method of accounting until the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal while we determined at august  that our investment in metron technology was not other than temporarily impaired  our decision on october  to use metron technology shares with a value of to settle the termination fee payment with metron technology triggered an impairment loss on that date for all of the shares we held 
accordingly  the difference between the per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon for purposes of the transition agreement on the shares held was recorded as a non cash impairment charge of million in our quarter ended november  the per share value reflected the average closing price of the common stock of metron technology for the five business days prior to the execution of the transition agreement 
upon completion of the termination of the distribution agreements with metron technology  our ownership in metron technology was reduced from approximately to approximately 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to account for our investment in metron technology as a marketable equity security available for sale and carried the investment at fair market per the closing price of metron technology s stock as reported on the nasdaq national market 
the fair value of metron technology is subject to stock market fluctuations 
as of august   we owned approximately million shares of common stock of metron technology  or a equity interest in metron technology  and the fair market value of our investment in metron technology was million  including unrealized holding gains of million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we conducted a review of the long lived assets of the microlithography business  as we transitioned to the pss business model 
accordingly  we recorded a write down of million against the property  plant and equipment assets of the pss business to write the assets down to their estimated fair value 
this write down included a million impairment charge associated with the pss facility and a million impairment charge related to the pss business equipment 
these impairment charges were based upon our review of the pss facility and business equipment and their estimated fair values 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges 
product warranty estimation we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  releases of new products and other factors  including product performance 
the warranty periods for new equipment manufactured by us range from to months 
special warranty reserves are also accrued for major rework campaigns 
although management believes the likelihood to be relatively low  claims experience could be materially different from actual results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
inventory reserves estimation we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the amounts of these reserves are based upon historical loss trends  inventory levels  physical inventory and cycle count adjustments  expected product lives  forecasted sales demand and recoverability 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of the industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry or by us 

table of contents we recorded million of inventory charges in the second quarter of fiscal based on the estimated future sales and recoverability  specifically related to our decision to wind down the microlithography business 
we determined the million inventory charges by comparing the inventory balance of the pss business as of march  to the inventory balance expected to be used for pss orders in backlog  anticipated orders  and anticipated order cancellations and adjusted the net inventory balance to its net realizable value 
during fiscal  we had sales of pss inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had sales of pss inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero 
in addition  we were able to reduce certain open purchase order commitments and inventory buyback requirements 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimation management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
the most significant risk is the risk of sudden unexpected deterioration in financial condition of a significant customer which is not considered in the allowance 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
results could be materially impacted if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorated and related accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible 
accounts receivable are charged off after management determines that they are uncollectible 
litigation liability estimation management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss and no estimate within the range is better than the other estimates 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management is not always able to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
industry update during fiscal  industry conditions continued to improve in parallel with strengthening global economic conditions 
unit demand for semiconductors  the products our customers produce exceeded the peak monthly levels during the first half of calendar during the same period  factory utilization rates for our customers exceeded percent  with many leading edge fabs running at or near their capacity limits 
however  we have seen some softening in the industry conditions in the second half of calendar while unit demand remains strong  our customers factory utilization rates have been declining since june as a result  our customers have become more cautious with respect to increasing their manufacturing capacity 
in calendar  worldwide demand for semiconductor or integrated circuit manufacturing equipment  as reported by dataquest  an industry research organization  was nearly billion 
in calendar  the reported demand for equipment had decreased to billion 
given the managed spending by our customers on new semiconductor device manufacturing capacity during the past few years  dataquest anticipates that the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment could increase by nearly percent in calendar as compared to calendar the increase in spending is being led by asian semiconductor manufacturers as unit demand in that region has grown 
industry analysts are forecasting demand for semiconductor equipment to increase only modestly from to percent in calendar as compared to 
table of contents results of operations for the fiscal year ended august   we had net income of  as compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended august  the improved financial performance was a result of increased sales revenue from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to improved industry conditions 
we also improved our gross margins to for fiscal and reduced operating expenses by approximately million as compared to fiscal wind down of microlithography business in march  we announced that we would wind down the microlithography business due to uncertain economic conditions and the weak semiconductor industry forecast 
the decision was also due to a history of operating losses of the microlithography business as a result of competitive pressures and general economic and industry conditions 
subsequent to the wind down  we provide support services for our polaris products through our pss business 
the pss business revenue represented million  or of our total revenue of million for fiscal  million  or  of our total revenue of million for fiscal and million  or  of our total revenue of million for fiscal prior to the wind down of the microlithography business  approximately of our employees worked in this business 
we recorded million in severance expenses in fiscal we recorded million of inventory charges in the second quarter of fiscal based on the estimated future sales and recoverability  specifically related to our decision to wind down the microlithography business 
we determined the million inventory charge based on the inventory balance as of march  as compared to the inventory balance expected to be used for pss orders in backlog  anticipated orders and anticipated order cancellations and adjusted the net inventory balance to its net realizable value 
during fiscal  we had sales of pss inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had sales of pss inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero 
in addition  we were able to reduce certain open purchase order commitments and inventory buyback requirements 
we will continue to try to sell the impaired inventory to our customers as spares  refurbished systems and upgrades to existing systems 
if unsuccessful  some of the items will be disposed of 
only as items are sold or disposed of will the reserve be reversed or reduced 
gross margins will be higher if inventory carried at a reduced cost is sold 
the higher margins will fluctuate depending on the timing of product sales  specific customers and specific inventory sold 
we also recorded a write down of million against the property  plant and equipment assets of the pss business 
this write down included a million impairment charge for the microlithography business facility 
this impairment charge was based upon our estimate of fair value 
also included in the write down was an impairment charge of million to the microlithography business equipment 
this impairment charge was based upon our review of microlithography business equipment and its estimated fair value 
the employee headcount for the pss group was reduced from approximately employees in february to employees at the end of fiscal we started to recognize the full financial savings of this reduction in the fourth quarter of fiscal the savings  consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits from the third quarter restructuring  was approximately million for the fourth quarter of fiscal and approximately million in fiscal our focus was to successfully wind down this business and transition it to the pss business 
our primary goals are to satisfy our remaining pss customer obligations and support requirements 
we are committed to providing a path for our customers to maximize the useful life for their polaris systems and have established key support services programs to support this goal 
we expect to generate to million of positive cash flow from this operation over the next several quarters as we continue to sell 
table of contents inventory  collect accounts receivable and assuming we are able to dispose of the owned facility in allen  texas 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a non binding letter of intent to sell this facility and sublease approximately  square feet for use by our pss business

impairment of goodwill due to a significant decline in our stock price in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the continued downturn in the industry and the overall global economic conditions  an impairment review of goodwill was completed as of august  as a result  the balance of goodwill was deemed other than temporarily impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal fiscal restructuring during the second quarter of fiscal  in response to the continued delay in an industry recovery and the overall economy  we implemented cost reduction actions 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion related to the fiscal restructuring 
sales revenue and shipments fiscal sales revenues were million as compared to million in fiscal the majority of the increase in fiscal related to increases in sc revenues 
sales revenues for sc increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sc sales revenues related primarily to increased shipments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to improved industry conditions 
sales revenues for pss increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in pss sales revenue in fiscal related primarily to increased upgrade and spares revenue  partially offset by a decline in equipment revenue associated with the transition to the pss model in the microlithography area 
fiscal sales revenues were million as compared to million for fiscal sales revenues for pss decreased to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal sales revenues for sc decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sales revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the industry downturn  competitive pricing pressures  and the global recession 
the decrease in fiscal was also due to the wind down of the microlithography business 
shipments were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal sc shipments increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in sc shipments related to increased bookings from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to improved industry conditions 
pss shipments decreased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal based upon our revenue recognition policy  revenue for certain shipments to customers are not recognized until customer acceptance  therefore depending on timing of shipments and customer acceptances  there are time periods where shipments may exceed sales revenue or sales revenue may exceed shipments 
international sales were million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal  million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal  and million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal international sales through our affiliates  
table of contents metron technology and m fsi  represented approximately of international sales during fiscal  of our total international sales during fiscal  and of our total international sales during fiscal the increase in international sales revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to our transition to a direct global distribution model in march as well as improved industry conditions in international markets 
we experienced increased sales in all international markets in fiscal the decrease in international sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to poor industry conditions 
in fiscal  total sales in europe and japan  however  represented a higher percent of total sales as compared to fiscal due to its broader customer base  sc has a higher percentage of international sales than pss 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s international sales 
we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million as compared to million at the end of fiscal backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer purchase order has been received 
because of the timing and relative size of orders and the possibility of cancellations or customer delays  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for future periods 
deferred revenue was approximately million as of the end of fiscal deferred revenue is included in deferred profit which is net of deferred cost of goods sold on the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the fiscal year end backlog  deferred revenue levels and anticipated orders in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect first quarter fiscal revenue to be in the range of to million 
we also expect fiscal first quarter orders to be between and million 
gross margin our gross margin fluctuates due to a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  as spare parts and service revenues generally have higher margins  the proportion of international sales  as international sales  particularly in asia  generally have lower margins due to pricing pressures  and utilization of manufacturing capacity 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in margins from fiscal to fiscal was primarily impacted by inventory charges of million recorded in the second quarter of see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion related to the pss inventory charges 
the increase in gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal was also due to the product sales mix shift to sc products  our go direct initiative in asia and europe and an increase in spares and service revenue to over percent of total revenue in fiscal as compared to percent of total revenue in fiscal fiscal gross margins were also favorably impacted by million of changes in warranty estimates primarily related to an sc product rework program in which actual costs were less than anticipated 
during fiscal  we had sales of pss inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero 
this was primarily due to sales revenues generated from unanticipated pss refreshed tools  spare parts and upgrades sales 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal would have been if we included the original cost of the pss inventory that had been written down to zero 
gross margin including the original cost of the pss inventory that had been written down to zero is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our management believes that the presentation of gross margin including the original cost of the pss inventory that has been written down to zero provides a useful analysis of our ongoing operating trends and helps investors compare our operating performance period over period

only as items are sold or disposed of will the reserve be reversed or reduced 
any reversal or reduction will be disclosed 
gross margins will be higher if inventory carried at a reduced cost is sold 
the decrease in gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily related to the million of pss inventory charges recorded in fiscal fiscal gross margins were also negatively impacted by million of changes in warranty estimates  primarily related to a pss reliability rework program 
margins in fiscal were also impacted by  of severance costs that were recorded to cost of goods sold in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the margins for fiscal were impacted by  of realignment charges that were recorded to cost of goods sold in the second quarter of fiscal we expect the gross profit margins for the first quarter of fiscal to decrease to between to of revenues  due to an anticipated change in product mix and the lower margins on the initial placement of our products at strategic customers 
we do not anticipate any significant impact on gross margins as a result of utilizing pss inventory that was previously written off

table of contents as compared to fiscal related to million of expense incurred to settle a patent infringement litigation in the second quarter of fiscal  offset by a decrease in information technology expenses 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the patent infringement litigation settlement 
these increases were also offset by savings related to organizational efficiencies from our transition to direct international distribution and the pss business model 
the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflected the impact of our cost control efforts 
the decrease was partially offset by our infrastructure investment in going direct in europe and the asia pacific region  the related addition of sales and service personnel in these regions and the severance costs associated with the wind down of the microlithography division 
selling  general and administrative expenses included realignment charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal are expected to be in the range of million to million  as we expand our product and program management resources in support of the demonstration programs with customers in europe and asia

these impairment charges were based upon our review of the pss business equipment and their estimated fair values 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion related to the write down of property  plant and equipment 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales in fiscal  and million  or of total sales  for fiscal the decrease in the dollar amount of research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to the reduction of engineering resources when we exited the resist processing market in march the decrease in the dollar amount of research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was related to the wind down of the microlithography business and the cost control efforts in the surface conditioning area 
in addition  there was million of realignment charges in fiscal and  of realignment charges in fiscal 
table of contents we expect research and development expenses to range from to million for the first quarter of fiscal as we continue to invest in new application and product development programs and continue to support our flagship products the magellan  the antares and the zeta 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was approximately million of income  or of total sales  for fiscal as compared to million of expense  or of total sales  for fiscal and million of income  or of total sales  for fiscal the change for fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to an approximately million non cash impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal for the shares of metron technology that we owned 
the change was also due to the million gain on the sale of approximately  shares of metron technology common stock in the first quarter of fiscal the change for fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to the approximately million non cash impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal for the shares of metron technology that we owned 
the change for fiscal as compared to fiscal was also related to a decrease in interest income due to lower average cash balances in fiscal as compared to fiscal we currently own approximately million shares of metron technology 
our basis in this stock is approximately per share  or million 
in august  applied materials announced that it was acquiring substantially all of the assets of metron technology 
it is anticipated that this transaction will close before the end of calendar we anticipate a to million cash distribution from metron technology after the transaction closes 
at that time  we would also record a to million gain on this sale 
as of the end of fiscal  we carried our investment in metron technology as a marketable security valued at million 
interest income is expected to be approximately  to  for the first quarter of fiscal  given our current level of cash reserves  the anticipated interest rates and the expectation that the sale of metron technology assets to applied materials will not close during the first quarter of our fiscal income tax benefit expense we recorded a tax expense of  in both fiscal and fiscal  primarily as a result of state franchise taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal this benefit was primarily a result of a refund that became available due to a tax law revision enacted in the third quarter of fiscal we filed the appropriate federal tax returns and received a cash refund of approximately  during the fourth quarter of fiscal our deferred tax assets on the balance sheet as of august  have been fully reserved for with a valuation allowance 
we do not expect to reduce our valuation allowance until we are consistently profitable on a quarterly basis 
overall  we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million at august   which will begin to expire in fiscal through fiscal if not utilized 
of this amount  approximately million is subject to internal revenue code section limitations on utilization 
this limitation is approximately million per year 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings losses of affiliates was approximately  of income for fiscal  million of losses for fiscal  and  of losses for fiscal the change in fiscal related to improved financial performance for m fsi in fiscal due to improved industry conditions in japan 
the change in fiscal from fiscal reflected the impact that deteriorating industry conditions had on metron technology 
in fiscal  metron technology wrote off a significant amount of 
table of contents its goodwill and incurred additional expenses in connection with the transition of its fsi product distribution business to fsi 
the losses from metron technology were partially offset by a positive contribution from m fsi 
the loss in fiscal was due to the impact that deteriorating industry conditions had on both metron technology and m fsi 
in fiscal  we no longer recorded equity in losses from metron technology  as our ownership  in metron technology has been below percent since the fourth quarter of fiscal on august   metron technology entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement purchase agreement with applied materials  inc applied  pursuant to which applied has agreed to acquire the worldwide operating subsidiaries and business of metron technology 
see item business marketing  sales and support for a discussion of the purchase agreement 
we anticipate that equity in earnings from m fsi ltd  our japanese affiliate  will range from  to  in the first quarter of fiscal as m fsi ltd continues to benefit from the improved industry conditions in japan 
net income loss based upon achieving anticipated revenue  gross margin and operating expense levels  we expect to record a net loss of to million in the first quarter of fiscal  excluding gains on sales of marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents were approximately million as of august   an increase of million from the end of fiscal the slight increase in cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances of million and million from the proceeds of sales of marketable securities  a million decrease in other long term assets and million of positive currency impact partially offset by funds used for operations of million and capital expenditures of million 
marketable securities were approximately million as of august   a decrease of million from the end of fiscal the decrease was due to the sale of million of marketable securities net of an increase in valuation of marketable securities of million 
accounts receivable increased million from the end of fiscal trade accounts receivable from non affiliates increased million from the end of fiscal the increase in trade accounts receivable related primarily to an increase in shipments from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the balance in trade accounts receivable from affiliates as of august  represented approximately of the fiscal sales to affiliates 
the timing of shipments to affiliates is impacted by our affiliates receipt of customer purchase orders  our production lead times and the ultimate ship dates 
inventory increased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase in inventory related primarily to increases in raw materials and purchased parts due to increased bookings to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase was also due to an increase in finished goods related to additional demonstration tool placements 
deferred profit decreased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease relates primarily to a decline in pss deferred profit 
as of august   our current ratio was to  and working capital was million 

table of contents the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total other long term liabilities represent payments related to a patent litigation settlement and minimum royalty payments or discounts granted under a license agreement 
as previously discussed  we have outstanding litigation regarding the hsu matter 
the total judgment against ssi together with post judgment interest as of august  aggregated approximately million 
ssi and the individual defendants have filed an appeal on a variety of grounds 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we posted an appeal bond on behalf of ssi and defendants in the amount of million 
as part of the posting of the bond  we entered into a letter of credit in the amount of million with a surety company 
this letter of credit is collateralized with restricted cash of approximately the same amount 
as of august  we had guarantees totaling  related to auto leases  vat and payroll requirements in europe 
these guarantees were collateralized with  of restricted cash 
the total balance of restricted cash as of august  was million 
in accordance with our israel distribution agreement with metron technology  if we give notice of a termination other than because of a breach of the agreement by metron technology  we are obligated to repurchase spare parts in metron technology s inventory 
the balance of spare parts in metron technology s inventory as of august  was approximately capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect capital expenditures to be less than million in the first quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately and million in the first quarter of fiscal at the first quarter expected run rate  we anticipate using to million of cash in the first quarter of fiscal  depending on the timing of accounts receivable collections and the expected placement of several additional evaluation systems with customers 
we believe that with existing cash  cash receipts  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds  there will be sufficient funds to meet our currently projected working capital requirements  and to meet other cash requirements through at least fiscal we believe that success in our industry requires substantial capital to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
one of our strategic objectives is  as market and business conditions warrant  to consider divestitures  investments or acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies particularly those that are complementary to our surface conditioning business 
we may fund such activities with additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  whether to maintain flexibility or to meet strategic objectives  could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
fin addresses the consolidation by businesses of variable interest entities 
table of contents and requires businesses to consolidate a variable interest entity if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  or receive a majority of the entity s expected returns if they occur  or both 
in december  the fasb revised fin for vies  the provisions of the revised fin became effective for us during the third quarter of fiscal we have assessed our relationships with m fsi in which we have a equity investment 
we have determined that the investment is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements pursuant to fin the adoption of the revised fin did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information and risks set forth in this report 
because our business depends on the amount that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment  downturns in the microelectronics industry may adversely affect our results 
the microelectronics industry experiences periodic downturns  which may have a negative effect on our sales and operating results 
our business depends on the amounts that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment 
the amounts they spend on capital equipment depend on the existing and expected demand for semiconductor devices and products that use semiconductor devices 
when a downturn occurs  some semiconductor manufacturers experience lower demand and increased pricing pressure for their products 
as a result  they are likely to purchase less semiconductor processing equipment and have sometimes delayed making decisions to purchase capital equipment 
in some cases  semiconductor manufacturers have canceled or delayed orders for our products 
typically  the semiconductor equipment industry has experienced more pronounced decreases in net sales than the semiconductor industry as a whole 
failure of our products to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our financial condition 
we believe that our growth prospects depend upon our ability to gain customer acceptance of our products and technology  particularly mm products 
market acceptance of products depends upon numerous factors  including compatibility with existing manufacturing processes and products  ability to displace incumbent suppliers or processes or tools of record  perceived advantages over competing products  and the level of customer service available to support such products 
moreover  manufacturers often rely on a limited number of equipment vendors to meet their manufacturing equipment needs 
as a result  market acceptance of our products may be affected adversely to the extent potential customers utilize a competitor s manufacturing equipment 
there can be no assurance that sales of new products will remain constant or grow or that we will be successful in obtaining broad market acceptance of our systems and technology 
we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new systems and enhance existing systems 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  we will make these expenditures well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of any new systems 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market any new systems is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle  including start up bugs  design defects and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems to the marketplace 
in addition  since our customers are not 
table of contents obligated by long term contracts to purchase our systems  our anticipated product orders may not materialize or orders that do materialize may be canceled 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  we may not be able to realize sufficient sales of our systems in order to recoup research and development expenditures 
the failure of any of our new products  for example the magellan  to achieve market acceptance would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 
if we do not continue to develop new products  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our business and results of operations could decline if we do not develop and successfully introduce new or improved products that the market accepts 
the technology used in microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes changes rapidly 
industry standards change constantly and equipment manufacturers frequently introduce new products 
we believe that microelectronics manufacturers increasingly rely on equipment manufacturers like us to design and develop more efficient manufacturing equipment  design and implement improved processes for microelectronics manufacturers to use  and make their equipment compatible with equipment made by other equipment manufacturers 
to compete  we must continue to develop  manufacture  and market new or improved products that meet changing industry standards 
to do this successfully  we must select appropriate products  design and develop our products efficiently and quickly  implement our manufacturing and assembly processes efficiently and on time  make products that perform well for our customers  market and sell our products effectively  and introduce our new products in a way that does not unexpectedly reduce sales of our existing products 
product or process development problems could harm our results of operations 
our products are complex  and from time to time have defects or bugs that are difficult and costly to fix 
this can harm our results of operations in the following ways we may incur substantial costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of products early in their life cycle  repeated defects or bugs can reduce orders  increase manufacturing costs  adversely impact working capital and increase service and warranty expenses  and we may require significant lead times between product introduction and commercialization 
as a result  we may have to write off inventory and other assets related to products and could lose customers and revenue 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing product and process development problems that could potentially harm our results of operations 
it may be difficult for us to compete with stronger competitors resulting from industry consolidation 
in the past several years  we have seen a trend toward consolidation in the microelectronics equipment industry 
we expect the trend toward consolidation to continue as companies seek to strengthen or maintain their market positions in a rapidly changing industry 
we believe that industry consolidations may result in competitors that are better able to compete 
this could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 

table of contents future acquisitions may dilute our shareholders ownership interests and have other adverse consequences 
because of consolidations in the semiconductor equipment industry we serve and other competitive factors  our management will seek to acquire additional product lines  technologies and businesses if suitable opportunities develop 
acquisitions may result in the issuance of our stock  which may dilute our shareholders ownership interests and reduce earnings per share 
acquisitions also may increase debt levels and the related goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in absorbing the new business  product line or technology  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entering new markets in which we have little or no experience  and possible loss of key employees of the acquired business 
because of the volatility of our stock price  the ability to trade fsi shares may be adversely affected and our ability to raise capital through future equity financing may be reduced 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future 
in fiscal  our stock price ranged from to and in fiscal  our stock price ranged from to per share 
the trading price of our common shares is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including factors discussed elsewhere in this report and the following failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts for a given period  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  press releases or announcements by  or changes in market values of  comparable companies  additions or departures of key personnel  and involvement in or adverse results from litigation 
the prices of technology stocks  including ours  have been particularly affected by extreme fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market generally 
these broad stock market fluctuations may have a negative effect on our future stock price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
in the future we could be the target of this type of litigation 
securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which can seriously harm our business 
because our quarterly operating results are volatile  our stock price could fluctuate 
in the past  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations may have a significant impact on our stock price 
the reasons for the fluctuations in our operating results  such as sales  gross profits  and net income  include the timing of significant customer orders and customer spending patterns 
during industry downturns  our customers may ask us to delay or even cancel the shipment of equipment orders 
delays and cancellations may adversely affect our operating results in any particular quarter if we are unable to recognize revenue for particular sales in the quarter in which we expected those sales 
the timing of new product and service announcements by us or our competitors 
new product announcements by us and our competitors could cause our customers to delay a purchase or to decide to purchase products of one of our competitors which would adversely affect our revenue 
table of contents and  therefore  our results of operations 
new product announcements by others may make it necessary for us to reduce prices on our products or offer more service options  which could adversely impact operating margins and net income 
the mix of products sold and the market acceptance of our new product lines 
the mix of products we sell varies from period to period  and because margins vary among or within different product lines  this can adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to sell our products which generate higher margins  our average gross margins may be lower than expected 
if we fail to sell our new product lines  our revenue may be lower than expected 
general global economic conditions or economic conditions in a particular region 
when economic conditions in a region or worldwide worsen  customers may delay or cancel their orders 
there also may be an increase in the time it takes to collect payment from our customers or even outright payment defaults 
this can negatively affect our cash flow and our results 
as a result of these factors  our future operating results are difficult to predict 
further  we base our current and future expense plans in significant part on our expectations of our longer term future revenue 
as a result  we expect our expense levels to be relatively fixed in the short run 
an unanticipated decline in revenue for a particular quarter may disproportionately affect our net income in that quarter 
if our revenue is below our projections  then our operating results will also be below expectations 
any one of the factors we list above  or a combination of them  could adversely affect our quarterly results of operations  and consequently may cause a decline in our share price 
because of our ownership position in m fsi ltd  adverse results of m fsi could adversely affect our results 
the profits or losses of our affiliate  m fsi ltd  can also significantly affect our financial results 
as of august   we had a interest in m fsi 
if this affiliate loses the business of a significant company for which it distributes or sells products  loses a significant customer or otherwise became less financially viable  it could have a negative effect on our financial condition 
changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may reduce our international sales 
almost all of our direct international sales are denominated in us dollars 
nonetheless  changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect our international sales 
sales for m fsi ltd are denominated in yen 
as a result  us dollar yen exchange rates may affect our equity interest in m fsi ltd s earnings 
m fsi ltd sometimes engages in so called hedging or risk reducing transactions to try to limit the negative effects that the devaluation of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have on operating results 
m fsi ltd will do so if a sale denominated in a foreign currency is sufficiently large to justify the costs of hedging 
to hedge a sale  m fsi ltd typically will commit to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at a given price at a future date 
if the customer cancels the sale  m fsi ltd may be forced to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at market rates to meet its hedging obligations and may incur a loss in doing so 
to date  the hedging activities of m fsi ltd have not had any significant negative effect on us 
because we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our products in europe and the asia pacific region starting in march  we incur labor  service and other expenses in foreign currencies 
as of august   we had not entered into any hedging activities and our foreign currency transaction loss for fiscal was insignificant 
we intend to evaluate various hedging activities and other options to minimize fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing foreign exchange rate risks and such failure may reduce our international sales or negatively impact our operating results 

table of contents because of the need to meet and comply with numerous foreign regulations and policies  the potential for change in the political and economic environments in foreign jurisdictions and the difficulty of managing business overseas  we may not be able to sustain our historical level of international sales 
we operate in a global market 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside of the united states 
for fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
for fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
these figures include sales through metron technology and m fsi  which accounted for of international sales in fiscal  of international sales in fiscal and of international sales in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total sales 
sales to customers outside the united states involve a number of risks  including the following imposition of government controls  compliance with us export laws and foreign laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in taxes and tariffs  longer payment cycles  difficulty of administering business overseas  and general economic conditions 
in particular  the japanese and asia pacific markets are extremely competitive 
the semiconductor device manufacturers located there are very aggressive in seeking price concessions from suppliers  including equipment manufacturers like us 
in fiscal  approximately of our international sales were attributable to these markets 
we seek to meet technical standards imposed by foreign regulatory bodies 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with those standards in the future 
any failure by us to design products to comply with foreign standards could have a significant negative impact on us 
because of the significant financial resources needed to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support and to invest in research and development  we may be unable to compete with larger  better established competitors 
the microelectronics equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive we will need significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support  and to invest in research and development 
we believe that the microelectronics industry is becoming increasingly dominated by large manufacturers who have the resources to support customers on a worldwide basis 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and customer support capabilities than us 
large equipment manufacturers have or may enter the market areas in which we compete 
in addition  smaller  emerging microelectronics equipment companies provide innovative technology 
we expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes 
we also expect them to introduce new products and processes with better performance and pricing 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to compete effectively in the united states or elsewhere 
we may be unable to continue to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe necessary to maintain our competitive position 
our failure to make these investments could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents because we do not have long term sales commitments with our customers  if these customers decide to reduce  delay or cancel orders or choose to deal with our competitors  then our results will be adversely affected 
if our significant customers  including ibm or texas instruments  reduce  delay  or cancel orders  then our operating results could suffer 
our largest customers have changed from year to year  however  sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of total sales in the fiscal  of total sales in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal texas instruments accounted for of total sales in fiscal  of total sales in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal ibm accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal we currently have no long term sales commitments with any of our customers 
instead  we generally make sales under purchase orders 
our backlog at august  was million  of which was comprised of orders from two customers 
all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer 
our backlog may not result in future net sales 
we schedule the production of our systems based in part upon order backlog 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
in addition  while we evaluate each customer order on a case by case basis to determine qualification for inclusion in backlog  there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog ultimately will result in future sales 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales  could harm our business 
because we depend upon our management and technical personnel for our success  the loss of key personnel could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our management and technical personnel 
the loss of a number of these key persons could have a negative effect on our operations 
competition is high for such personnel in our industry in all of our locations 
we periodically review our compensation and benefit packages to ensure that they are competitive in the marketplace and make adjustments or implement new programs for that purpose  as appropriate 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we require to continue to grow and operate profitably 
our employment costs in the short term are to a large extent fixed  and therefore any unexpected revenue shortfall could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating expense levels are based in significant part on our headcount  which generally is driven by longer term revenue goals 
for a variety of reasons  particularly the high cost and disruption of lay offs and the costs of recruiting and training  our headcount in the short term is  to a large extent  fixed 
accordingly  we may be unable to reduce employment costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue or gross margin shortfall  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
because our intellectual property is important to our success  the loss or diminution of our intellectual property rights through legal challenge by others or from independent development by others  could adversely affect our business 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures 
however  we believe that our financial performance will depend more upon the innovation  technological expertise and marketing abilities of our employees than on such protection 
in connection with our intellectual property rights  we face the following risks our pending patent applications may not be issued or may be issued with more narrow claims  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  
table of contents rights granted under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us  foreign laws may not protect our intellectual property rights  and others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we occasionally receive notices from others alleging infringement claims 
we have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past and we could become involved in similar lawsuits or other patent infringement claims in the future 
we cannot guarantee the outcome of such lawsuits or claims  which may have a significant negative effect on our business or operating results 
we are currently exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 
we currently are  and in the future  may be  involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  contracts or other matters 
these legal proceedings and claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend  and could divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims 
if we are not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms and or successfully prosecute or defend its position  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our sales cycle is long and unpredictable  which could require us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result 
sales cycles for some of our products can run as long as to months 
as a result  we may not recognize revenue from efforts to sell particular products for extended periods of time 
we believe that the length of the sales cycle may increase as some current and potential customers centralize purchasing decisions into one decision making entity 
we expect this may intensify the evaluation process and require us to make additional sales and marketing expenditures with no assurance that a sale will result 
accounting for equity compensation under future accounting changes may adversely impact our expected financial results 
under current accounting rules  we do not record charges to our financial statements in connection with the grant at fair market value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
however  we expect these accounting rules to change 
these new option related expenses may affect our future operating results 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with gaap 
the gaap are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission  the financial accounting standards board and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business  including rules relating to purchase accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition  stock compensation and the consolidation of variable interest entities  have recently been revised or are under review 
changes to those rules or the questioning of our current accounting practices may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business 
in addition  our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a change in the facts and circumstances 
table of contents surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results 
we do not intend to pay dividends 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates due to investments in foreign based affiliates 
as of august   our investments in affiliates include a interest in metron technology and a interest in m fsi ltd metron technology operates mainly in europe  asia pacific and the united states 
m fsi ltd operates in japan 
we denominate all us export sales in us dollars 
our investment in metron technology is currently accounted for as marketable securities and is subject to market fluctuations related to the stock price 
during fiscal  metron technology s stock price ranged from to 
see item business marketing  sales and support for information on a purchase agreement metron technology entered into with applied materials  inc because we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our products in europe and the asia pacific region starting in march  we have and will continue to incur labor  service and other expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rate risks 
as of august   we had not entered into any hedging activities and our foreign currency transaction loss for fiscal was insignificant 
we are currently evaluating various hedging activities and other options to minimize these risks 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates as all material outstanding debt was repaid on september  as of the end of fiscal  amortized cost approximated market value for all outstanding marketable securities 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
the impact on loss before income taxes of a change in short term interest rates would be approximately  based on cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of august
