item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements for eastman chemical company eastman or the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
all references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company s management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  doubtful accounts  impaired assets  environmental costs  pensions and other postemployment benefits  goodwill and other intangibles  and l itigation and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition and results 
these policies require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
customer programs and incentives the company records estimated obligations for customer programs and incentive offerings  which consist primarily of revenue or volume based amounts that a customer must achieve over a specified period of time  as a reduction of revenue to each underlying revenue transaction as the customer progresses toward reaching goals specified in incentive agreements 
these estimates are based on a combination of forecast of customer sales and actual sales volumes and revenues against established goals  the customer s current level of purchases  and eastman s knowledge of customer purchasing habits and industry pricing practice 
the incentive payment rate may be variable  based upon the customer reaching higher sales volume or revenue levels over a specified period of time in order to receive an agreed upon incentive payment 
since the volume incentives and their usefulness to the company are largely based on the overall supply and demand in the markets for the products the company produces  significant changes in supply and demand can positively or negatively impact the effectiveness of the company s customer programs and incentives 
this has been particularly true for the company s pet polymers business 
the company s reserve for customer programs and incentives was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively  and was recorded as a reduction of trade receivables 
if market conditions change  the company could be forced to take actions to adjust customer incentive offerings to maintain market share and capacity utilization

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts the allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowances are based on the relative age of each individual receivable and management s regular assessment of the financial condition of the company s customers 
additionally  management regularly reviews credit limits based on payment activity and other customer related factors to determine whether or not to extend credit and what other limiting terms  such as prepayment requirements  will be levied on given customers 
the company increases the allowances based on a monthly evaluation of the aged receivables  and based on their age  writes off a certain percentage 
these expectations have historically been relative ly accurate with regard to most of the company s customers 
however  under certain circumstances  such as a customers bankruptcy  the company will increase the allowance to reflect the collectability of the receivable 
the company believes  based on historical results  the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per share is low 
however  if one of the company s key customers were to file for bankruptcy  or otherwise be unable to make its required payments  or there was a significant continued slow down in the economy  the company could be forced to increase its allowances 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
the company s allowances were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively

impaired assets the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such assets are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
for long lived assets to be held and used  fair value of fixed tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or appraisal 
for long lived a ssets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale  fair value is determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
as the company s assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change  additional write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted  resulting in recognition of a charge or benefit to earnings 
the company recorded fixed tangible asset impairments of million and definite lived intangible asset impairments of million during for more information  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
environmental costs the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chem ical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december

accounting for asset retirement obligations  the company also establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains 
environmental assets include but are not limited to land fills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed  a reserve is established for the future environmental remediation anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on an expected life of the environmental assets 
these future expenses are accreted into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
currently  the company estimates the useful life of each individual asset up to years 
if the company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs o r its estimate of the useful lives of these assets  the future expenses to be accreted into earnings could increase or decrease 
the company s reserve for environmental contingencies was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively  representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and  for asset retirement obligation costs  the amount accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives 
for additional information see note  and to the company s consolidated financial statements and schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts 
united states pension and other postemployment benefits the company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits 
additionally  eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase for employees and health care cost trends 
at december   the company assumed a discount rate of  an expected return on assets of  a rate of compensation increase of  and an initial health care cost trend of 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions incl uding retirements  mortality  turnover and plan participation 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for us pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans change in assumption impact on pre tax us pension expense impact on december  projected benefit obligation for us pension plans impact on december  benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans basis point decrease in discount rate million million million basis point increase in discount rate million million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million no impact n a basis point increase in expected return on assets million no impact n a

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the company s pension and other postemployment benefit obligations are established each december the expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds  primarily the domestic  international  and private equities markets 
the assumed discount rate is based upon an index of high quality  long term corporate borrowing rates 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the difference is recorded as an unrecognized gain loss and then amortized into earnings over a period of time  which may cause the cost of providing these benefits to increase or decrease 
the charges applied to earnings in   and due to the amort ization of unrecognized actuarial losses were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during however  an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  as of december  for the impact on the pension s projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates  if any 
while the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements  it is an indication of the amount the company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years 
the amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon intere st rates  actual returns on plan assets  retirement and attrition rates of employees  and other factors 
for additional information see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  the company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company

eastman was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented 
eastman typically utilizes commercial paper to meet its liquidity needs 
the credit facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes 
accordingly  outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings available under the credit facility 
because the credit facility expires in july  the commercial paper borrowings supported by the credit facility are classified as long term borrowings because the company has the ability to refinance such borrowings on a long term basis

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the first quarter  the company entered into interest rate swaps that converted the effective interest rate of the notes due in to variable rates 
these original interest rate swaps were settled during the fourth quarter  resulting in million cash proceeds being received by the company 
the gain resulting from the settlement of the swaps is reflected as an increase in the current portion of long term borrowings and will be amortized into earnings as a reduction to interest expense through the maturity of the notes in january in conjunction with the settlement of the original interest rate swaps  new interest rate swaps were entered into in the fourth quarter  converting the effective interest rate on the notes due in to variable rate s that averaged at december  and at december  the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding debt resulted in increases of million in other current assets and the current portion of long term borrowings at december  in the third quarter  the company entered into interest rate swaps that converted the effective interest rate on million of the million notes due in to variable rates such that the effective average rate was on the variable portion at december  the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding debt resulted in a decrease of million for long term borrowings and an increase in other long term liabilities at december  in the fourth quarter  the company entered into interest rate swaps that converted the effective interest rate on million of the million notes due in to variable rates such that that the effective avera ge rate was on the variable portion at december  the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding debt resulted in an increase of million for long term borrowings and a decrease in other long term liabilities at december  the company contributed million to its us defined benefit pension plans during the company anticipates that additional funding of between and million may be required in funding requirements for are dependent on congressional legislation regarding pension discount rates 
cash flows from operations and the sources of capital described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements including those requirements related to the normal seasonal increase in working capital expected in the first half of the year 
however  the company s cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations  raw materials availability and cost  demand for and pricing of eastman s products  capacity utilization and other factors described under forward looking statements and risk factors below 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for include million related to the purchase of certain machinery and equipment previously utilized under an operating lease 
the company continues its emphasis on cash flow management and  for  expects that capital spending and other directed investments for small acquisitions and other ventures will increase compared to  but be no more than depreciation and amortization 
other commitments at december   the company s obligations related to notes and debentures totaled approximately billion to be paid over a period of years 
other borrowings  related primarily to commercial paper borrowings  totaled approximately million 
the company had various purchase obligations at december  totaling approximately billion over a period of approximately years for materials  supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business 
the company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable  noncancelable and month to month operating leases totaling approximately million over a period of several years 
of the total lease commitments  approximately relate to machinery and equipment  including computer and communications equipment and production equipment  approximately relate to real property  including office space  storage facilities and land  and approximately relate to railcars 
in addition  the company had other liabilities at december  totaling approximately billion related to pension  retiree medical  and other postemployment obligations

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the obligations described above are summarized in the following table dollars in millions payments due for period notes and debentures commercial paper and other borrowings purchase obligations operating leases other liabilities a total and beyond total a amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the company in the periods indicated 
the amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates  health care trends  actual returns on plan assets  retirement and attrition rates of employees  continuation or modification of the benefit plans  and other factors 
such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the company 
in addition  amounts related to retiree medical do not include the potential effect of the recently enacted medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
for further details regarding the implementation of the act  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
on january   the company retired the million of notes due the company also had outstanding guarantees at december  additional information related to these guarantees is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet and other financing arrangements if certain operating leases are terminated by the company  it guarantees a portion of the residual value loss  if any  incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets 
the company believes  based on current facts and circumstances  that a material payment pursuant to such guarantees in excess of the payments included above is remote 
under these operating leases  the residual value guarantees at december  totaled million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars  company aircraft  and other equipment 
the company has long term commitments relating to joint ventures as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company guarantees up to million of the principal amount of the joint ventures third party borrowings  but believes  based on current facts and circumstances and the structure of the ventures  that the likelihood of a payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote 
as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  eastman entered into an agreement in that allows it to generate cash by reducing its working capital through the sale of undivided interests in certain domestic trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third party 
under this agreement  receivables sold to the third party totaled million at december  and undivided interests in designated receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the purchased interest in the receivable pools 
the company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes 
thus  eastman is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations treasury stock transactions the company is currently authorized to repurchase up to million of its common stock 
no shares of eastman common stock were repurchased by the company during and during   shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately million  or an average price of per share  were repurchased 
a total of  shares of common stock at a cost of approximately million  or an average price of approximately per share  have been repurchased under the authorization 
repurchased shares may be used to meet common stock requirements for compensation and benefit plans and other corporate purposes 
in the first quarter  the company issued  previously repurchased shares as the annual company contribution to the eastman investment and employee stock owner ship plan 
dividends the company declared cash dividends of per share in the fourth quarters  and and a total of per share in  and environmental certain eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation  and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies 
in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites  the company  along with many other entities  has been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs 
in addition  the company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
adequate reserves for environmental contingencies have been e stablished in accordance with eastman s policies as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
because of expected sharing of costs  the availability of legal defenses  and the company s preliminary assessment of actions that may be required  it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters  individually or in the aggregate  will be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company s assumptions about remedial requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other prps 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  chemical control regulations and testing requireme nts could result in higher or lower costs 
in addition to remediation activities  the company establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains 
environmental assets include but are not limited to land fills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed  a reserve is established for the future environmental remediation anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on an expected life of the environmental assets 
these future expenses are accreted into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately of the total environmental reserve at december  currently  the company s environmental assets are expected to be no longer useable at va rious different times over the next years 
if the company was to invest in numerous new environmental assets  or  these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the company anticipated they would  the amortization on them would increase  and could have a material negative impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote  and does not anticipate  based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation  that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary 

eastman

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at december  and  the company had recognized environmental contingencies of approximately million and million  respectively  representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and  for closure postclosure costs  the amount accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives 
the company s cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were estimated to be approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts pertain primarily to operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities  but also include expenditures for construction and development 
the company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the company s planned level of capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 
inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a material adverse impact on eastman s costs 
the cost of raw materials is generally based on market price  although derivative financial instruments may have been utilized  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market price fluctuations

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  the following are some of the important factors that could c ause the company s actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements the company has manufacturing and marketing operations throughout the world  with approximately of the company s sales revenue attributable to sales outside the united states 
economic factors  including foreign currency exchange rates  could affect the company s sales revenue  expenses and results 
although the company utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies  any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect sales revenue  expenses and results and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
in addition  changes in laws  regulations  or other political factors in any of the countries in which the company operates could affect business in that country or region  as well as the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions  divestitures and investments  and enter into alliances  as part of its strategies for growth and improved profitability 
the completion of such transactions is subject to the timely receipt of necessary regulatory and other consents and approvals needed to complete the transactions which could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including the satisfactory negotiation of the transaction documents and the fulfillment of all closing conditions to the transactions 
additionally  there can be no assurance that such transactions will be successfully completed on a timely and cost efficient basis or that they will achieve projected op erating earnings or cost reduction targets 
the company has made strategic investments in technology  services businesses  and other ventures in order to build certain eastman capabilities 
there can be no assurance that such investments will achieve their objectives or that they will be beneficial to the company s results of operations 
the company owns assets in the form of equity in other companies  including joint ventures  technology investments and genencor 
such investments are minority investments in companies which are not managed or controlled by the company and are subject to all of the risks associated with changes in value of such investments including the market valuation of those companies whose shares are publicly traded 
the company has undertaken and will continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
in addition to cost reduction initiatives  the company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases  where warranted and accepted by the market  however  the company s earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized  not be sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs  or have a negative impact on demand and volume 
the company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials for its operations and utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
in addition  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the company operates or does business  or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials  could affect availability and costs of raw materials

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations while temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur  these items are generally sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements 
however  their continuous availability and price are subject to unscheduled plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand  or due to domestic or world market and political conditions  changes in government regulation  war or other outbreak of hostilities 
eastman s operations or products may  at times  be adversely affected by these factors 
the company s competitive position in the markets in which it participates is  in part  subject to external factors 
for example  supply and demand for certain of the company s products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which  in turn  impact demand for and pricing of the company s products 
the company has an extensive customer base  however  loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers 
limitation of the company s available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations could have a material adverse affect on sales revenue  expenses and results of operations and financial condition 
the company s facilities and businesses are subject to complex health  safety and environmental laws and regulations  which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future 
the company s accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based 
the amount accrued reflects the company s assumptions about remedial requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viabilit y of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
the company accesses the capital and credit markets on a regular basis 
access to these markets and the cost of capital is dependent in part upon the company s credit rating received from independent credit rating agencies 
an adverse change in the company s credit rating could affect the renewal of existing credit facilities or the company s ability to obtain access to new credit facilities or other debt financing in the future  could adversely affect the terms under which the company can borrow  and could increase the cost of new borrowings  other debt  or capital 
the company s operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations 
to mitigate the company s exposure to these market risks  eastman has established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis  which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and or commodity prices 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include short term commercial paper and long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements 
currently  these borrowings are predominately us dollar denominated 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions  and other factors 
for and  the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates of were approximately million and million  respectively  and an additional million for each one percentage point change in interes t rates thereafter 
this exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates 
the company s operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business 
in order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than two years and denominated in foreign currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency trans actions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts or currency options 
for  the market risks associated with forward exchange contracts utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model and a adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency hedged by the company were approximately million and an additional million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
further adverse movements in foreign currencies would create losses in fair value  however  such losses would not be linear to that disclosed above
