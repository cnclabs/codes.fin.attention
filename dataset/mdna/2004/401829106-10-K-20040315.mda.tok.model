item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as you read this management s discussion and analysis  you may find it helpful to refer to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
these consolidated financial statements present the results of our operations for  and as well as our financial position at december  and we analyze and explain the annual changes in the specific line items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations 
this analysis may be important to you in making decisions about your investment in guilford pharmaceuticals inc overview guilford is a pharmaceutical company engaged in the research  development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceutical products that target the hospital and neurology markets 
we market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products within our targeted markets  conduct clinical research to expand the labeled indications for our marketed products  and develop new product candidates 
we also collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies to support the sales and marketing of our products and the clinical development of our products and product candidates 
we currently have two marketed products gliadel wafer  and aggrastat injection 
gliadel wafer provides targeted  site specific chemotherapy for the treatment of malignant glioma at the time of initial surgery  in conjunction with radiation and chemotherapy  and for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme 
aggrastat injection is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation approved for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome  or acs 
our product pipeline consists of product candidates in various stages of clinical and preclinical development 
aquavan injection  a prodrug of propofol  is in phase ii clinical trials for procedural sedation during brief diagnostic or therapeutic procedures 
gpi  our lead neuroimmunophilin ligand compound  is in phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of parkinson s disease and peripheral nerve injury 
dopascan injection  an imaging agent used to diagnose and monitor the progression of parkinson s disease  is in registration in japan and finland by our corporate collaborators 
our preclinical research programs include the development of naaladase inhibitor compounds  through our corporate partner  pfizer  inc  for neuropathic pain  and on our own for prostate cancer  drug addiction and traumatic brain and spinal cord injury and the development of parp inhibitor compounds for cancer chemosensitization and radiosensitization 
we have financed our operations since inception in july of  primarily through the issuance of equity securities  convertible subordinated notes  revenues from the sales of gliadel and more recently aggrastat  funding pursuant to collaborative and partnering agreements and proceeds from loans or other borrowings 
until such time as we become substantially profitable  any or all of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to assist the company s capital requirements 
acquisition of aggrastat injection aggrastat from merck and co  inc on october   we acquired the rights to aggrastat injection aggrastat  from merck and co  inc merck  in the united states and its territories and possessions which include puerto rico  the u 
s 
virgin islands and guam  for a purchase price of million  plus a royalty based on the net sales of aggrastat 
in connection with the acquisition of aggrastat  we entered into an agreement with merck through  to supply us with our requirements of aggrastat 
aggrastat  a glycoprotein gp iib iiia receptor antagonist  is used for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome acs including unstable angina  which is characterized by chest pain at rest  and non st elevation myocardial infarction nstemi 
in order to finance the acquisition  we used million of working capital and entered into a million revenue interest financing arrangement with paul royalty fund  lp and paul royalty fund ii  lp  or prf  pursuant to a revenue interest assignment agreement 
for more information on the revenue interest obligation  see the liquidity and capital resources section 

table of contents results of operations overview of in fiscal  our primary goal was to expand our hospital based commercial portfolio and to increase top line revenues in order to accelerate our transition to profitability 
to this end  in we acquired the rights to aggrastat from merck in the united states and its territories and possessions and obtained fda approval to expand the label of gliadel for use at the time of initial surgery for malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation 
with the acquisition of aggrastat injection we gained an established hospital product with extensive clinical data and the potential for market and product growth 
our strategy is to use an active and focused marketing effort to increase sales and build market share for aggrastat 
in order to begin putting this strategy into effect  in we planned the re launch of the marketing of aggrastat for the treatment of acs  which in recent years has declined in hospital usage as a gp iib iiia receptor antagonist 
in addition  in we began preparations for the initiation of a phase iii clinical program studying aggrastat for use in percutaneous coronary intervention  or pci  in order to try and expand the label for the product 
through both the expansion of our marketing efforts for the use of aggrastat to treat acs and our efforts to expand aggrastat s label for use in pci  we hope to achieve our goal of significantly expanding top line revenues through a broader hospital based commercial portfolio 
our acquisition of aggrastat also is intended to enhance promotional activities for our other marketed product  gliadel wafer  as well as help establish an infrastructure for the future launch of aquavan injection  pending successful completion of clinical trials and regulatory review 
by increasing our portfolio of marketed products  we hope to leverage the expertise and capabilities of our highly specialized  clinically focused sales force in the sale of pharmaceuticals for use in hospital settings 
we believe the expansion of our line of marketed pharmaceutical products will provide the economies necessary to effectively cross market our products and create enhanced brand recognition  each of which are drivers of revenue growth 
revenues during   and  we recognized revenues of million  million  and million  respectively 
these revenues consisted of the following in millions revenues gliadel wafer net product sales aggrastat net product sales revenues from license fees  milestones and other total revenue gliadel wafer product sales gliadel wafer  or gliadel  net sales were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during this time  we sold gliadel i directly to a specialty distributor  ii directly to hospitals  iii by drop shipment to hospitals pursuant to purchase orders from wholesalers  iv to distributors located outside the united states for resale by those distributors in non united states markets  and v directly to a corporation for use in clinical trials 
the increase in net sales year over year is primarily attributable to fda approval in february of the expanded label of gliadel for use at the time of initial surgery for malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation 
sales in were higher than sales in due to sales to our distributors in  in anticipation that we would receive approval from the fda to expand the label for gliadel wafer to 
table of contents include use at the time of first surgery for malignant glioma 
in march  the fda informed us that the expanded label was not approvable 
consequently  physician demand for the product did not increase  resulting in an imbalance between units in the distribution channel and pull through demand 
because the supply of the product in the distribution channel had increased in excess of demand and the first surgery approval was no longer viewed as imminent or assured  we chose  during the second half of to reduce the sale of product to our specialty distributor in order to more closely align the number of units in the distribution channel with demand under the more limited product label for recurrent surgery 
gliadel net sales to customers within the united states were approximately million  million  and million  and of total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the remaining units were sold outside the united states  including europe  canada  south america  israel and australia  either through distributors or direct to hospitals 
in millions specialty distributors sales direct hospital sales gliadel advantage program international sales total net product sales during the years ended december    and approximately million  units  million units  and million units  respectively  were sold to a specialty distributor 
during the third quarter of we decided to sell gliadel through specialty distributors 
at the time of the specialty distributors initial orders in  we provided extended payment terms of up to days 
during and  all specialty distributor sales were made to specialty pharmaceuticals distribution spd formerly known as national specialty services  inc  a division of cardinal health  inc in  we sold to spd and another specialty distributor 
spd has nationwide marketing and distribution capabilities that complement our sales and marketing efforts 
additionally  when we make sales to spd  they are responsible for shipping the product that they purchase to hospital pharmacies  thereby reducing our overall distribution costs 
without this distributor  we would incur separate shipping costs from our logistical distributor for each shipment of the product to hospital pharmacies and other end users 
spd receives discounts on its purchases of gliadel based on its expected sales to end users and the amount of capital it has committed to the product as of the date of its purchases 
we have the ability to accept or reject purchase orders from spd at our sole discretion 
for the years ended december   and  our specialty distributors sold   and units  respectively  to hospitals and wholesalers 
it is our general practice to have our sales representatives direct hospital pharmacies to spd for purchases of the product 
additionally  for the first six months of  we engaged in an enhanced marketing initiative with spd that ended on june  of the treatments sold to spd during the six month period ended june   units were sold in connection with this marketing initiative 
this marketing initiative included mailing information about gliadel to prospective customers  telemarketing activity and working with our sales representatives to set up customer accounts 
this marketing initiative cost approximately  for the six month period ended june  we did not operate a similar marketing initiative during or for the years ended december    and  approximately million  million  and million  of gliadel net us sales  respectively  resulted from sales directly to hospitals or drop shipments to hospitals pursuant to purchase orders from wholesalers 
included in the million for the year ended december  are approximately million in sales to a corporation for use in a competitive clinical trial 
substantially all of these sales to hospitals and wholesalers included our normal payment terms including discounts for early payment 

table of contents during the years ended december  and  we sold treatments of gliadel pursuant to our gliadel advantage program  which was designed to increase neurosurgeons awareness of gliadel and to ensure its availability when the neurosurgeon requires it 
under this program  customers were provided day payment terms 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized net revenue of approximately million and million  respectively  under this program 
we were no longer offering this program 
revenue aggrastat product sales for the year ended december   we recognized net sales of aggrastat of approximately million  which represents net sales from october  when we acquired the rights to aggrastat from merck 
during this time period  we sold aggrastat directly to several wholesalers 
three wholesalers accounted for approximately million of net sales of aggrastat 
in preparation for the re launch of a marketing campaign for aggrastat in the united states  we have increased the size of our sales force and completed a training program for the entire sales and marketing team 
these re launch efforts will focus on expanding the acs market 
revenue other we entered into an exclusive license agreement with pfizer  on may   for a novel class of potential drugs called naaladase inhibitors 
under the terms of the agreement  pfizer will have exclusive rights to develop our naaladase inhibitors worldwide  and will conduct and pay for all costs associated with research  development  manufacturing  and commercialization of any products that may result from this agreement 
as part of the agreement  we are eligible to receive royalties on future product sales and milestone payments related to the successful development and commercialization of a naaladase inhibitor 
upon signing the agreement  we received a million payment from pfizer 
under the terms of the agreement  we do not have continuing involvement relating to the contract as defined by sab as a result  the payment was recognized as revenues from license fees and milestones in the second quarter of during the year  we also recorded a million milestone payment from drl  our partner in japan for dopascan injection  related to the filing of an application for regulatory approval to market the product in japan 
cost of sales and gross margin our cost of sales for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in cost of sales for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of increased unit sales for gliadel 
gliadel cost of sales includes the cost of materials  labor and overhead 
for the years ended december  and  gross profit percentage net product sales less cost of sales as a percent of net product sales was and  respectively 
cost of sales for the year ended december  was negatively affected by the write off of approximately million of inventory  which we determined did not meet product specifications through regular quality control testing 
we also established an additional reserve for spoiled or damaged inventory of approximately million based upon our historical experience 
gross profit percentage was for the year ended december  gross profit percentage for the year ended december  was lower than for the year ended december  because of decreased production volumes in compared to  when volumes were increased to support expected higher demand driven by an anticipated first surgery approval for gliadel 
the cost to manufacture gliadel can vary materially with production volume 
to the extent that production levels increase or decrease in the future  we anticipate that the unit cost to manufacture gliadel may decrease or increase  respectively 
as a result  we would expect the cost of product sales of gliadel  and accordingly  gross profit percentage  to fluctuate from year to year 
for the manufacture of aggrastat  we have entered into an exclusive supply agreement with merck for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  of aggrastat 
table of contents until december  merck has agreed to supply us with the finished product of aggrastat  through its contract manufacturers  baxter for bags until august  and ben venue for vials through the end of we may negotiate direct contractual relationships with these manufacturers in the future 
aggrastat cost of sales for the year ended december  was million 
research and development expenses beginning in fiscal year  the company began recording research and development costs under two platforms  pharmaceutical technologies and biopolymer technologies 
from january   through december   the company incurred  in the aggregate  costs of million for its pharmaceutical technologies platform  million for its biopolymer technologies platform  and million of indirect expenses 
our research and development projects are currently focused on pharmaceutical research and development 
for our biopolymer technologies  we have chosen to pursue potential corporate partnerships or other strategic alternatives in order to further their research and development  rather than develop these projects ourselves 
the following chart sets forth our projects in each of these areas and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status pharmaceutical technologies gpi neuroimmunophilin ligand phase ii active aquavan injection phase ii active aggrastat injection for pci indication phase iii active naaladase inhibitors pre clinical active partnered other neuroimmunophilin ligand research active parp inhibitors research active other cns projects research active biopolymer technologies paclimer microspheres ovarian cancer phase i ii inactive paclimer microspheres lung cancer phase i ii inactive lidocaine pe formerly lidomer microspheres phase i inactive other biopolymer projects research inactive for each of our research and development projects  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies 
we may also incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  consulting and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses  such as facility and equipment costs  utilities  general research and development management and other administrative overhead are allocated to research and development generally based on  among other things  the extent to which our general research and development efforts make use of facilities  non project personnel and other resources 
because of the uncertainties involved in progressing through pre clinical and clinical testing  and the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval and in establishing collaborative arrangements  among other factors  we cannot reasonably estimate the future expenses and timing necessary to complete our research and development projects as well as estimating the period in which material net cash inflows from significant projects are expected to commence 
our research and development expenses were divided between our research and development platforms in the following manner years ended december in millions pharmaceutical technologies biopolymer technologies indirect expenses 
table of contents pharmaceutical technologies our pharmaceutical technologies research and development costs increased in compared to due to increased expenditures of million in connection with further clinical development of gpi  our lead neuroimmunophilin ligand compound 
this increased spending was partially offset by reduced expenditures of million in our aquavan project as we incurred preparation and initiation costs in which related to the phase ii colonoscopy clinical trial in progress during fiscal year additionally  in  we made a million milestone payment to proquest  the licensor of the aquavan technology 
our pharmaceutical technology research and development expenses decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in expenses in our naaladase inhibitor program resulting from the completion of our phase i clinical trials of gpi a lead naaladase inhibitor compound 
the decrease in spending on our naaladase inhibitors was partially offset by an increase in spending on our fkbp neuroimmunophilin ligand technology and our aquavan injection program 
biopolymer technologies our biopolymer technology research and development expenses decreased in compared to due to a decision made as part of the corporate restructuring in the third quarter of to focus our research and development activities on our pharmaceutical technologies 
currently  we do not plan to conduct additional research or clinical testing on our biopolymer technologies  instead we are pursuing strategic alternatives to further develop these technologies 
our biopolymer technology research and development expenses decreased in  compared to  due to a decrease in expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of both paclimer microspheres and lidocaine pe formerly lidomer microspheres 
the decrease in clinical development expenses resulted from the completion of our clinical trials for paclimer microspheres ovarian cancer and lidocaine pe post surgical pain during the first quarter of in connection with our corporate restructuring in the third quarter of  we terminated the clinical trial for paclimer microspheres lung cancer 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses decreased in the year ended compared to primarily as a result of the full year impact of the restructuring efforts taken in the third quarter of of this decrease  million related to the reduction in employee costs  million in facility and equipment expenses  and the remainder related to certain non core project and other indirect costs 
our indirect research and development expenses decreased for the year ended compared to as a result of the reduced workforce and the associated overhead costs

costs and expenses associated with our general and administrative functions were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase for the year ended december  from results from increased employee costs of approximately million and recruiting and relocation efforts due to the acquisition of the aggrastat product line to expand the sales force and the research and development teams in preparation for a phase iii clinical trial of aggrastat 
the increase for the year ended december  from was largely attributable to a restructuring charge of million  of which million consisted of employee severance costs  including severance pay  related payroll taxes and insurance and outplacement services 
the remaining million represented the costs of decommissioning certain research and development laboratories 
our general and administrative functions include the areas of executive management  finance and administration  investor and public relations  corporate development  human resources and legal

intangible amortization increased from fiscal year to as a result of the aggrastat product rights acquisition in the fourth quarter of intangible amortization for the years ended december   and included million related to the reacquisition of gliadel rights in october acquired in process research and development as part of the acquisition of aggrastat  we engaged a third party to appraise the value of the intangible assets acquired 
based upon this appraisal  we allocated million of the purchase price of the aggrastat product rights in the fourth quarter of to acquired in process research and development 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows pertaining to the incomplete research and development of aggrastat for use in pci 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the acquired in process research and development was charged to expense as of the date of the acquisition 
this item is described in more detail in note to the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
other income and expense other income and expense consists primarily of income on our investments and interest expense on our debt and other financial obligations 
our investment income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in investment income in compared to results primarily from overall lower yields on invested capital and lower average investment balances maintained during the periods 
the decrease in investment income in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates and investment balances maintained during those periods 
we incurred interest expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and the increase in interest expense in compared to is primarily attributable to the million convertible subordinated notes offering and the million term loan 
table of contents arrangement with wachovia bank  national association 
additional interest expense for  and interest expense for and  resulted from i loans from a commercial bank that helped fund the construction of our manufacturing  administrative  and research and development facilities and the purchase of certain furniture and equipment  ii capital leases entered into for the purchase of computer equipment  and iii a note payable to a commercial bank primarily used to repay a million note payable to cardinal pursuant to the cardinal agreement 
we incurred revenue interest expense of million related to the prf revenue interest obligation for the year ended december  revenue interest expense was calculated using the interest method  which resulted in an imputed interest rate equivalent to the internal rate of return on future royalty payments 
these future royalty payments are based on the estimated future revenues 
we will periodically review estimated future revenues and make adjustments as necessary 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary cash requirements are i to fund our research and development programs  ii to support our sales and marketing efforts  iii to obtain regulatory approval  iv to prosecute  defend and enforce any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  v to fund general corporate overhead  and vi to support our debt service requirements and contractual obligations 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the issuance of equity securities  convertible subordinated notes  revenues from the sales of gliadel and more recently aggrastat  funding pursuant to collaborative agreements and proceeds from loans or other borrowings 
in evaluating alternative sources of financing we consider  among other things  the dilutive impact  if any  on our stockholders  the ability to leverage stockholder returns through debt financing  the particular terms and conditions of each alternative financing arrangement and our ability to service our obligations under such financing arrangements 
in  we engaged in four financing transactions a million convertible note offering  a million revenue interest obligation and warrant offering associated with the aggrastat product acquisition  a million equity private placement and an million term loan agreement 
in may  we entered into an agreement granting pfizer the exclusive right to develop naaladase inhibitors worldwide  for which pfizer paid us million upon the execution of the agreement  and was to pay us million on or before march  if pfizer does not pay the additional million by that date  we may elect to have all rights to the naaladase inhibitor technology revert to us 
under the terms of the agreement  pfizer is to conduct and pay for all costs associated with research  development  manufacturing and commercialization of any products that may emerge from the agreement 
as part of the agreement  we would be eligible to receive royalties on future product sales and milestone payments related to the successful development and commercialization of a naaladase inhibitor 
the schedule of milestone payments under the agreement outlines a total of million to be paid for each compound developed through commercialization  as well as one additional set of milestone payments totaling million for an additional indication for the same compound  if pfizer continues the development and commercialization of any compounds under the agreement 
we are currently discussing with pfizer the status of the collaboration  including whether they will make the million payment under our agreement  or whether there are other mutually agreeable terms and conditions under which we would agree to continue the collaboration 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments were million and million at december  and  respectively 
of this amount  million is restricted as collateral for certain of our loans and other financial lease obligations 

table of contents sources and uses of cash operating activities cash used in operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net changes in assets and liabilities provided cash of million in mainly due to an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
the increase in accounts payable and other liabilities relates to the timing of our research and development activity and professional services supporting our transactional activity 
the change in accounts receivable results from the timing of sales and the subsequent cash receipt thereof 
specifically  and of gliadel product sales in and  respectively  were made to a specialty distributor 
depending on the timing of the sales to the specialty distributor and associated payment  which is traditionally within days  the company s accounts receivable will increase or decrease for comparative reporting periods 
at december  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  in accounts receivable outstanding relating to the specialty distributor 
these relate to sales made in december

on october   we acquired the rights to aggrastat from merck and co  inc  or merck  in the united states and its territories  for a purchase price of million  plus a royalty based on net sales of aggrastat 
from the closing until december   we do not pay royalties on net sales less than million 
on net sales above million prior to december   and beginning on january   on all sales of aggrastat  we will pay royalties ranging from to of aggrastat net sales  based upon our achievement of certain net sales thresholds 
in connection with the acquisition of aggrastat  we entered into an agreement with merck  to supply us with our requirements of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of aggrastat through additionally  until june   merck has agreed to provide us with certain services related to the transition of aggrastat from merck to us

in october  we entered into a new master lease agreement to provide up to million for computer and equipment financing for a period of one year 
our previous master lease agreement  entered into in august  expired on june the term of each operating lease varies from to months based upon the type of equipment being leased 
as of december   the company had leased approximately million in equipment under this master lease agreement 
in connection with our various lease arrangements  we are required to maintain restricted cash in the amount of million 
during  we terminated our agreement with cardinal health to provide us with a contract sales force 
the termination has led to a dispute regarding amounts owed to cardinal at the termination date 
cardinal asserted that it was owed approximately million 
in  its affiliate specialty pharmaceuticals distribution  or spd  offset the amount of cardinal s claim against an existing trade receivable from spd to us 
we do not believe we had any remaining obligations to cardinal at december  relative to the agreement  however  in we have recorded a reserve in the amount of million for the spd account receivable that was not paid when due 
we have an agreement with spd to whom we sell gliadel that permits either us or spd to terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
under the terms of our agreement with spd  if the agreement is terminated  we have an obligation to repurchase any remaining treatments of gliadel that it may have in its inventory 
as of december   we believe that spd had approximately million of gliadel in its inventory 

table of contents future cash needs historically  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  revenue from the sale of gliadel  funding pursuant to collaborative agreements and proceeds from loans and other borrowings  and during the second and third quarters of  the issuance of convertible debt securities 
during the fourth quarter of  we financed the acquisition of aggrastat through a revenue interest financing arrangement 
our future capital requirements and liquidity will depend on many factors  including but not limited to  revenues from the sale of gliadel and aggrastat  progress of our research and development programs  progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in our existing research relationships  competing technological and marketing developments  ability to establish collaborative arrangements  ability to enter into licensing agreements and contractual arrangements with others  conversion of long term convertible notes  the costs of servicing debt  the costs of product in licensing  and substantial future expenditures we expect to make to increase sales of aggrastat 
because of the risks and uncertainties involved in the following the amount of our sales of gliadel and aggrastat  the outcomes and costs of pre clinical testing and clinical trials and the time when those outcomes will be determined  obtaining future corporate partnerships  the time and expense of obtaining regulatory approval  competing products potentially coming to market  and obtaining freedom to operate for our patented technologies 
we cannot reasonably estimate when we may incur significant future expenses 
we believe that our existing resources will be sufficient to fund our activities through at least the next twelve months 
however  we expect to need significantly greater capital in the near future in order to achieve our business objectives 
the source  timing and availability of this funding will depend on market conditions  interest rates and other factors 
this funding may be sought through various sources  including debt and equity offerings  corporate collaborations  bank borrowings  lease arrangements relating to fixed assets  or other financing methods 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  curtail or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  reduce the scope of our efforts to market and sell gliadel and or aggrastat  reduce our workforce  reduce our facilities  reduce the scope of our intellectual property protection  or license or transfer rights to our research or development programs to third parties 
if we are required to do one or more of the foregoing due to insufficient funds  then it may have the effect of delaying our ability to generate additional revenues from any of our products or product candidates 
we may also have to outsource one or more of our programs in order to continue its development  resulting in increased costs 

table of contents contractual commitments the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations and our research and development projects in thousands payments due by period contractual commitments total years long term debt capital lease obligations revenue interest obligation operating leases research and development arrangements total contractual commitments this table does not include any milestone payments under agreements we have entered into in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
also  minimum annual research expenditures pursuant to such license agreements have been excluded from this table as we expect to spend those amounts as we progress the development of the underlying technologies 
in the aggregate  these minimum annual research expenditures are approximately million and typically apply to all years prior to regulatory approval of a product incorporating the licensed technology 
similarly  we have excluded the royalty payments due to merck in connection with the aggrastat acquisition  as the amount and timing are not determinable 
under the terms of the asset agreement with merck  merck is entitled to royalty payments on net sales of aggrastat through october  the royalty payments to be paid to merck are calculated as follows calendar year  and on aggrastat net sales up to  on aggrastat net sales in excess of  and less than on aggrastat net sales in excess of  and less than on aggrastat net sales in excess of  and less than  and on aggrastat net sales over  calendar year and succeeding calendar years on aggrastat net sales up to  on aggrastat net sales in excess of  and less than on aggrastat net sales in excess of  and less than on aggrastat net sales in excess of  and less than  and on aggrastat net sales over  we granted prf a revenue interest in gliadel wafer  aggrastat injection  and certain other products which provides for prf to receive on the first million of gliadel wafer and aggrastat  annual net sales  plus for net sales exceeding million through december  from january  through december   the percentages increase to on the first million in annual net sales  plus on any net sales exceeding million 
in addition  prf receives a revenue interest in other guilford products to the extent that specified future gliadel wafer and aggrastat  net sales are not achieved 
at a minimum  we will pay prf million in  million in  million in  million in each of and million in each of though actual payments to prf under the agreement may be higher  we have included the minimum payments as contractual commitments 
research and development arrangements include commitments that we have entered into at december   to engage third parties to perform various aspects of our research and development efforts subsequent to december  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of gliadel and aggrastat  is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed and determinable  iii title has passed and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our primary customer for gliadel is specialty pharmaceuticals distribution or spd  a specialty pharmaceutical distributor who sells directly to hospitals 
product demand by this distributor during a given period may not correlate with prescription demand for the product in that period 
as a result  we periodically evaluate spd s inventory position 
if we believe these levels are too high based on prescription demand  we will either not accept purchase orders from or ship additional product to spd until these levels are reduced  or we will defer recognition of revenue if we determine that there is excess channel inventory for our products 
we have three primary wholesalers for aggrastat  amerisourcebergen corporation  cardinal health  inc and mckesson corporation  who sell directly to hospitals 
product demand during a given period may not correlate with prescription demand for the product in that period 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  damaged product returns  and exchanges for expired product are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
we establish these revenue reductions as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience  adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
research and development expenses 
for each of our research and development projects  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies 
we may also incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  consulting and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses  such as facility and equipment costs  utilities  general research and development management and other administrative overhead are allocated to research and development generally based on  among other things  the extent to which our general research and development efforts make use of facilities  non project personnel and other resources 
we accrue clinical trial expenses based on estimates of work performed and completion of certain milestones 
accrued clinical costs are subject to revisions as trials progress to completion 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known a change in estimate 
expense of other contracted research arrangements or activities are charged to operations either under the terms of the contract  milestones or in some instances pro rata over the term of the agreement 
based on the facts and circumstances  we select the method which we believe best aligns the expense recognition with the work performed 
intangible assets 
when we purchase products we classify the purchase price  including expenses and assumed liabilities  as intangible assets 
the purchase price may be allocated to product rights  trademarks  patents and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation experts 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by considering the remaining life of the patents  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other related factors 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are often uncertain 
long lived assets 
we review our property and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 

table of contents revenue interest obligation 
our million revenue interest obligation was recorded as debt as the company has significant continuing involvement in the generation of the cash flows due to prf 
monthly revenue interest payments made to prf will reduce the future obligation 
the obligation will be amortized under the effective interest method 
the effective interest method results in an imputed interest rate equivalent to prf s internal rate of return on future revenue interest payments 
these future revenue interest payments are based on estimated future revenues 
we will periodically review estimated future revenues and update the imputed interest rate as necessary

risk factors an investment in our stock is very speculative and involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following important factors  as well as the other information in this report and our other sec filings  before purchasing our stock 
we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain 
we may not be able to achieve or sustain significant revenues or earn a profit in the future 
since we were founded in july  with the sole exception of  we have not earned a profit in any year 
our losses for the years ended december   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
our losses result mainly from the significant amount of money that we have spent on research  development and clinical trial activities 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to have significant additional losses over the next several years due to expenses associated with our product candidates related to research  development and clinical trial activities  applying for and obtaining meaningful patent protection and establishing freedom to commercialize and applying for and receiving regulatory approval for our drug product candidates 

table of contents our product candidates are in research or various stages of pre clinical and clinical development 
except for gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection  none of our products or product candidates may be sold to the public 
nearly all of our past revenues have come from our sale and distribution of gliadel wafer  payments from aventis and amgen under now terminated agreements with each of them  supporting the research  development and commercialization of our product candidates  and royalty payments from aventis sale and distribution of gliadel wafer 
presently  we expect to receive significant revenue only from sales of gliadel wafer  aggrastat injection and from milestone and royalty payments  if any  received as a result of our recent license agreement with pfizer relating to our naaladase inhibitors 
we do not expect that the revenue from these sources will be sufficient to support all our anticipated future activities 
we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of our product candidates for the next several years  if ever  because of the significant risks associated with pharmaceutical product development 
many factors will dictate our ability to achieve sustained profitability in the future  including our ability to successfully market  sell  distribute and obtain additional regulatory approvals for gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection  the achievement by pfizer of development milestones and the successful development  regulatory approval  marketing and sales of products derived from our naaladase inhibitors  the successful development of our other product candidates either on our own  or together with future corporate partners with whom we enter into collaborative or license agreements  and the ability to in license or acquire additional products in our targeted markets 
we will require substantial funds in addition to our existing working capital to develop our product candidates and otherwise to meet our business objectives 
we will require substantial funds in addition to our existing working capital to develop our product candidates and otherwise to meet our business objectives 
we have never generated enough revenue during any period since our inception to cover our expenses and have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial funds to continue our research and development and clinical programs and to support our sales and marketing efforts 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional capital when we need it  on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital in a timely manner  then we may not be able meet our business objectives 
our current business objectives require us to license  partner or strategically finance one or more of our development programs  or otherwise alter our business objectives based on our capital resources 
consistent with our strategy and subject to our current capital resources  we will depend on either corporate collaborations  strategic financings or both  in order to develop one or more of our product candidates through to commercialization 
if we are not able to complete one of these transactions for one or more of our development programs  then we may have to alter or curtail our business objectives based on our capital resources 
if we do so  it could result in delaying the progress of pre clinical research or clinical trials  and consequently  the eventual commercialization of a marketed product based on one of these programs  or eliminating one or more research or development programs from our business objectives 
we will depend on gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection for revenues 
our short term prospects depend heavily on sales of gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection  our commercial products 
for the year ended december   gliadel wafer accounted for approximately of our net product sales revenue 
gliadel wafer was launched commercially in the united states by aventis and its predecessors in february after having received approval from the fda 
table of contents in september we do not know whether the product will ever gain broader market acceptance 
if gliadel wafer fails to gain broader market acceptance  the revenues we receive from sales of gliadel wafer would be unlikely to increase 
until february   we only had approval from the fda to market gliadel wafer in the united states for a limited subset of patients who suffer from brain cancer 
prior to that time  our approval was for those patients who had a brain tumor surgically removed and had recurrent forms of a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme  or gbm 
a recurrent gbm is one in which the cancer has returned after initial surgery to remove a brain tumor 
the number of patients undergoing recurrent surgery for gbm is very limited  and we believe the total number of patients on an annual basis who have recurrent gbm in the united states is approximately  to  on february   we received fda approval to also market gliadel wafer for patients undergoing initial surgery  also known as first line therapy  in the united states for malignant glioma in conjunction with surgery and radiation 
we estimate that the total number of patients undergoing initial surgery in the united states is between approximately  and  per year 
in the second quarter of we instituted a new sales and marketing effort for gliadel wafer for initial surgery 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in this effort or in achieving sales of gliadel wafer for use in initial surgeries 
in addition  in january we submitted applications for approval to market gliadel wafer in europe for patients undergoing initial surgery for malignant glioma 
in november  we withdrew those applications  while we were waiting for the fda to respond to a similar application in the united states 
we resubmitted these european applications in november presently gliadel wafer is approved for the recurrent gbm market in only countries  including france  spain  germany and the uk gliadel wafer is currently approved for first line therapy only in the united states and canada 
if we are not able to obtain additional approvals  the market for gliadel wafer would remain limited outside of the united states  which reduces the potential sales of gliadel wafer 
regardless of the number of foreign regulatory approvals that we have received  international sales to date comprised less than of worldwide sales of gliadel wafer for the year ended december  we acquired aggrastat injection from merck on october  aggrastat injection is a glycoprotein gp iib iiia receptor antagonist used for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome acs including unstable angina  which is characterized by chest pain when one is at rest  and non st elevation myocardial infarction nstemi 
prior to acquiring aggrastat injection  we have never marketed and sold a product for cardiovascular conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to market and sell aggrastat injection 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate 
our revenues and expenses have fluctuated significantly in the past 
this fluctuation has in turn caused our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
we expect the fluctuations in our revenues and expenses to continue and thus our operating results should also continue to vary significantly 
these fluctuations may be due to a variety of factors  including the timing and amount of sales of gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection  the timing and realization of milestone and other payments from existing and future corporate partners  the timing and amount of expenses relating to our research and development  product development  and manufacturing activities  and the extent and timing of costs related to our activities to obtain patents on our inventions and to extend  enforce and or defend our patent and other rights to our intellectual property 
because of these fluctuations  it is possible that our operating results for a particular quarter or quarters will not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  causing the market price of our 
table of contents common stock to decrease 
for example  the trading price of our common stock from january  to december  ranged from to 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our existing and future debt obligations 
our ability to pay the required interest and principal payments on our debt depends on the future performance of our business 
as of december   we had total long term debt and revenue interest obligations of million of which million is due in we will require substantial funds to service our debt obligations and to operate our business in the future  including to fund research and development activities  pre clinical and clinical testing  to manufacture our products and to make acquisitions 
the following are the company s contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations and research and development projects for the next months in thousands contractual commitments long term debt capital lease obligations revenue interest obligation operating leases research and development arrangements total contractual commitments this table does not include any milestone payments under agreements we have entered into in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
also  minimum annual research expenditures pursuant to such license agreements have been excluded from this table as we expect to spend those amounts as we progress the development of the underlying technologies 
in the aggregate  these minimum annual research expenditures are approximately million and typically apply to all years prior to regulatory approval of a product incorporating the licensed technology 
similarly  we have excluded the royalty payments due to merck in connection with the aggrastat acquisition  as the amount and timing are not determinable 
we granted prf a revenue interest in gliadel wafer  aggrastat  and certain other products which provides for prf to receive on the first million of gliadel wafer and aggrastat  annual net sales  plus for net sales exceeding million through december  from january  through december   the percentages increase to on the first million in annual net sales  plus on any net sales exceeding million 
in addition  prf receives a revenue interest in other guilford products to the extent that specified future gliadel wafer and aggrastat  net sales are not achieved 
at a minimum  we will pay prf million in  million in  million in  million in each of and million in each of though actual payments to prf under the agreement may be higher  we have included the minimum payments as contractual commitments 
research and development arrangements include commitments that we have entered into at december   to engage third parties to perform various aspects of our research and development efforts subsequent to december  we have a history of net losses 
our historical financial results have been  and we anticipate that our future financial results will be  subject to fluctuations 
unless we are able to substantially increase our profitability and cash flow from operations compared to historical levels or obtain refinancing  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future capital will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our debt  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other liquidity needs  we may be required to restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital or we may be required to sell assets 
we cannot assure you that if and when required to do so we will be able to accomplish those actions on satisfactory terms  or at all 

table of contents the market price of our stock may be negatively affected by market volatility 
the market price of our stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
furthermore  the stock market generally and the market for stocks of companies with lower market capitalizations and small biopharmaceutical companies  like us  have from time to time experienced and likely will again experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
from time to time  stock market professionals publish research reports covering our business and our future prospects 
for a number of reasons  we may be unable to meet the expectations of these professionals and our stock price may decline 
these expectations may include announcements by us or our competitors of clinical results  technological innovations  regulatory approvals  product sales  new products or product candidates  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  regulatory developments affecting our products  period to period fluctuations in the results of our operations  market conditions for emerging growth companies and biopharmaceutical companies  revenues received from gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection  and our expenditures 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against those companies 
if we face such litigation  it would result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which would negatively impact our business 
furthermore  market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  which could limit our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions of products or technology 
the large number of shares of common stock eligible for future sale upon conversion of our convertible notes could depress our stock price 
upon conversion of our  principal amount of notes at their conversion price of  approximately  shares of common stock would be issuable 
our stock price could be depressed significantly if the holders of the notes decide to convert their notes and sell the common stock issued thereby or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
we have limited sales experience  and we expect to incur significant expense in marketing  selling and distributing gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection 
when we began selling gliadel wafer ourselves in january  it was the first time that we had undertaken direct sales and marketing activities 
we  therefore  have limited experience in engaging in sales and marketing efforts 
this limited experience may limit our success selling gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection 
additionally  our sales and marketing efforts may use resources and require attention from management that would otherwise be provided to our drug development programs 
the success of our pfizer collaboration is dependent on a number of factors  most of which are outside of our control 

table of contents regulatory and development milestone payments as well as royalty amounts on product sales payable to us under our collaboration with pfizer depend on a number of factors 
many of these factors are not within our control  including the selection of one or more appropriate lead compounds  successful design and completion of pre clinical and clinical development activities  application for and obtaining regulatory clearances to market potential products  commercialization of products  and the successful preservation and extension of intellectual property rights licensed to pfizer 
all of these activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
moreover  under the terms of our collaboration with pfizer  we have no control over their development activities regarding the naaladase inhibitors  which have been left to the sole discretion of pfizer 
our agreement with pfizer also does not specify a binding timetable for achieving development and commercialization goals with respect to the naaladase inhibitors 
if pfizer decides to conduct clinical trials on a product candidate resulting from our collaboration  pfizer still may not be able successfully to complete those clinical trials and then receive clearance from the fda or foreign regulatory authorities to market and sell any such products 
even if pfizer is able to obtain all regulatory approvals necessary to market a product resulting from our collaboration  our agreement does not specify any minimum sales requirements for pfizer 
this means that any royalty amounts payable to us in the future will depend entirely on the sales and marketing efforts of pfizer  activities over which we will have no control 
in addition  our agreement with pfizer does not prevent pfizer from pursuing technologies for product candidates competitive with the naaladase inhibitors now or in the future 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will earn any additional payments under the pfizer agreement or that any amounts earned will be significant 
we do not have manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of any of our product candidates 
currently  we have no manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of any of our product candidates 
consequently  in order to complete the commercialization process of any of our product candidates  we must either acquire  build or expand our internal manufacturing capabilities  or rely on third parties to manufacture these product candidates 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to accomplish either of these tasks 
if we are not able to do so  it would impede our efforts to bring our product candidates to market  which would adversely affect our business 
moreover  if we decide to manufacture one or more of our product candidates ourselves rather than engage a contract manufacturer  we would incur substantial start up expenses and would need to expand our facilities and hire additional personnel 
third party manufacturers must also comply with fda  drug enforcement administration  and other regulatory requirements for their facilities 
in addition  the manufacture of product candidates on a limited basis for investigational use in animal studies or human clinical trials does not guarantee that large scale  commercial production is viable 
small changes in methods of manufacture can affect the safety  efficacy  controlled release or other characteristics of a product 
changes in methods of manufacture  including commercial scale up  may  among other things  require the performance of new clinical studies 
revenues from gliadel wafer  aggrastat injection  or future products  if any  depend in part on reimbursement from health care payors  which is uncertain 
the efforts of government and insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability 
these efforts may also affect the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers  suppliers and collaborative partners  in turn affecting demand for our products 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription 
table of contents pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
while we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a negative effect on our business and operating results 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which private health insurers  organizations such as hmos and governmental authorities reimburse the cost of our products and related treatments 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
furthermore  even if reimbursement is available for our products  we cannot be sure that it will be available at price levels sufficient to cover the cost of our products to customers 
this may have the effect of reducing the demand for our products  or may prohibit us from charging customers a price for our products that would result in an appropriate return on our investment in those products 
a significant portion of our sales of gliadel wafer are to specialty pharmaceuticals distribution formerly known as national specialty services  inc  a specialty pharmaceutical distributor 
approximately of our sales of gliadel wafer in  and approximately in  were made to specialty pharmaceuticals distribution  or spd  a nationwide specialty pharmaceutical distributor 
we have an agreement with spd regarding its purchase of the product that permits either us or spd to terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
we have no assurance that spd will not exercise its rights to terminate its agreement with us at any time 
if spd does terminate the agreement  there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into an arrangement with another specialty distributor for the purchase and sale of gliadel wafer 
additionally  under the terms of our agreement with spd  if the agreement is terminated  we have an obligation to repurchase any remaining treatments of gliadel wafer that spd may have in its inventory 
as of december   we believe that spd had approximately million of gliadel wafer in its inventory 
spd orders gliadel wafer treatments based upon  among other things  its estimation of our ability and its ability to successfully sell gliadel wafer to hospital pharmacies and its desired level of inventory 
if the demand for gliadel wafer from hospital pharmacies decreases  or spd decreases the amount it keeps in its inventory  spd may decrease or stop making additional purchases of the product from us 
the result of such a decrease would most likely be our reporting lower sales of gliadel wafer 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase sales of aggrastat injection  nor can we be certain that we will be able expand the labeled indications for aggrastat injection 
when we purchased aggrastat injection from merck and co  inc  merck had not been actively promoting the product in the united states 
our strategy for reintroducing aggrastat injection into the united states marketplace involves actively promoting the product and  subject to an understanding with the fda  conducting an additional clinical trial for aggrastat injection  in order to try to expand its labeled indications 
we cannot be certain that our promotion of the product will let us maintain or lead to increased sales based on the product s current indication 
additionally  we cannot be certain that we will be able to reach an understanding with the fda as to an appropriate clinical trial design in order to expand its indications  that we will be able to fully enroll the clinical trial or that if conducted the clinical trial will be successful 
if it is successful  we cannot be certain that the expanded indication will lead to increased sales or market share 

table of contents we depend and will continue to depend upon merck to supply us with finished product until we establish relationships directly with certain manufacturers for aggrastat injection  and at that time  we will continue to depend on merck to supply us with the active ingredient for aggrastat injection 
merck is obligated to supply us with the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  for aggrastat injection until aggrastat injection is sold as a finished product in both vials and bags  which are manufactured and filled for merck by third parties  known as contract manufacturers 
merck s contractual relationships with these third party suppliers last until december   for vials  and until august   for bags 
under our agreement with merck  we are entitled to enter into direct relationships with these contract manufacturers to obtain quantities of finished product of aggrastat injection 
if we do not enter into direct relationships with these contract manufacturers prior to months after the date that we acquired the product from merck  we may continue to receive quantities of finished product through merck  although without remedies against the contract manufacturers if they fail to supply merck with the finished product that we need to purchase 
we also may enter into relationships with other contract manufacturers if we are unable to enter into direct relationships with merck s manufacturers  however  we will not be able to do this before january   for vials  or august   for bags 
if merck is not able to provide us with api or finished product  as applicable  then we may be entitled to money damages under certain circumstances  but we may not be able to procure alternative sources of either api or finished product 
because we depend upon this relationship with merck for both the finished product and key ingredient of aggrastat injection  the limited duration of merck s obligation to us  and the potential lack of an alternative provider may adversely affect the operation of our business 
merck is providing us with certain transition services until june   without which we may not be able to successfully integrate aggrastat injection into our business 
merck is obligated to provide us with certain transition services from october   until june   including warehousing of finished product  accounts receivable management  billing  collection and recordkeeping 
if merck does not provide us with these services  or does not provide these services in a timely or professional manner  we may not be able to successfully integrate aggrastat injection into our business  which may result in our not achieving sales of aggrastat injection that we expect 
we may not be able to successfully perform the services for us that merck is presently performing for us as transition services 
when merck is no longer providing us with transition services  we will be required to perform those services on our own 
we have never performed these services before with respect to aggrastat injection 
if we are not able to perform these services successfully  it may negatively affect our ability to sell the product  or manage the recordkeeping  billings and collections  among other things  associated with the sales of the product 
the amount of inventory of aggrastat injection at pharmaceutical wholesalers may negatively affect our sales of the product 
aggrastat injection was sold by merck to pharmaceutical wholesalers  among other customers 
these wholesalers buy quantities of products to resell to hospitals pharmacies and other end users 
oftentimes  when they think that a pharmaceutical company may increase the price of a product  they order additional quantities of the product  in order to purchase under existing sales and marketing programs  or at the lower price 
when we purchased aggrastat injection from merck  we could not be certain what quantity of aggrastat injection wholesalers were maintaining 
the amount of inventory of the product that pharmaceutical wholesalers had at the time that we acquired the product or currently have  could negatively affect our sales of the product 

table of contents paul royalty funds is entitled to a portion of our revenues  which may limit our ability to fund some of our operations 
if we do not achieve certain sales targets for gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection  paul royalty funds may be entitled to a greater percentage of our revenues  revenues from future products we may acquire or certain of our product candidates 
under the terms of our revenue interest assignment agreement with paul royalty fund  lp and paul royalty fund holdings ii  who we refer to as paul royalty funds or prf  from october   through december   prf is entitled to receive of the company s gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection combined annual net sales up to million  and of those combined annual net sales in excess of million  and from january   through december  the end of the term of the financing arrangement with prf  these percentages are and  respectively 
if combined gliadel and aggrastat annual net sales are less than million  million  or million in   and  respectively  then prf will receive the higher of the minimum payments for such years described below or of combined gliadel and aggrastat net sales 
if gliadel and aggrastat net sales are less than million in any of the years through  then prf will receive the higher of the minimum payments for such years described below  or of combined gliadel and aggrastat net sales 
during each year of the term of the arrangement with prf  prf will be entitled to receive a portion of revenues from products that the company may acquire in the future  or of aquavan injection and gpi each a product candidate of the company  in the case that the company s calculated annual obligation s to make royalty payments under the revenue interest assignment agreement based upon the combined net sales of gliadel and aggrastat are less than million for  million for  million for  million for  million for  million for  million for  or million for and  respectively 
the company will pay prf minimum royalties of million in  million in  million in  million in each of and million in each of prf is also entitled to receive portions of amounts payable to the company on the resolution of future intellectual property disputes involving gliadel or aggrastat and on any future sale of ex north american marketing rights to gliadel 
in addition to its revenue interest in the company s products or future products  as the case may be  prf received five year warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
under certain circumstances  paul royalty funds may require us to repurchase its revenue interest  the payment of which may significantly deplete our cash resources or limit our ability to enter into significant business transactions 
prf may be entitled to require us to repurchase its revenue interest under the following circumstances if we fail to maintain an escrow account funded with eight quarters of minimum payments to prf or fail to maintain at least million of net working capital  if we fail to make our minimum payments to prf  if we sell gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection with prf having partial rights to make us repurchase its interest in the event of the sale of one  but not both products  upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or similar event  or upon certain conditions related to a change of control of us 
the repurchase amount guarantees prf a return in an amount over its initial investment and is reduced based on payments that we have previously made to prf prior to the time that its interest is repurchased  but the repurchase price may never exceed three and a half times prf s initial investment  or million 
the exercise of this repurchase right may significantly impair our ability to fund our operations 
additionally  because prf would be entitled to exercise this repurchase right upon a change of control of us  or upon the sale of gliadel wafer or aggrastat injection  we may not be able to effect a business transaction that would have one of these results 
we have pledged our assets related to gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection to paul royalty funds  therefore  we may not be free to utilize those assets at our discretion 
prf has been granted a security interest in the intellectual property assets related to gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection  which in the aggregate accounted for all of the company s net product 
table of contents revenue of million for the year ended december  as of december   the intangible assets related to gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection were million  or approximately of total assets 
we  therefore  may not be free to utilize those assets at our discretion  such as selling or outlicensing rights to part or all of those assets  without first obtaining the permission of prf 
this requirement could delay  hinder or condition  our ability to enter into corporate partnerships or strategic alliances with respect to these assets 
the integration of aggrastat injection into our business and our clinical development plans for aggrastat injection and aquavan will require significant additional capital 
in order to successfully integrate aggrastat injection into our business  which includes expanding our commercial operations  to conduct clinical trials to expand the labeled indication of aggrastat injection  and to conduct a phase iii clinical trial of aquavan  we will require significant additional capital resources within the next eighteen months 
this additional financing may take the form of an offering of debt or equity  and that offering could be material in size 
if we conduct a primary equity offering  the issuance of the additional shares of common stock may be dilutive to our existing stockholders and may have a negative effect on the market price of our stock 
we do not know if those capital resources will be available to us 
if they are not available  we may not be able to successfully execute on these business objectives or on any other business or operational goals 
we face technological uncertainties in connection with the research  development and commercialization of new products 
the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical drugs involve significant risk 
before a drug can be commercialized  we  or a future corporate partner will have to expend substantial capital and effort to develop our product candidates further  which includes conducting extensive and expensive pre clinical animal studies and human clinical trials  apply for and obtain regulatory clearance to develop  market and sell such product candidates  and conduct other costly activities related to preparation for product launch 
in some of our research programs  we are using compounds that we consider to be prototype compounds in the research phase of our work 
by prototype compounds we mean compounds that we are using primarily to establish that a relevant scientific mechanism of biological or chemical action could have commercial application in diagnosing  treating or preventing disease 
we generally do not consider our prototype compounds to be lead compounds acceptable for further development into a product because of factors that make them unsuitable as drug candidates 
these factors may include the ability for the compound to be absorbed  metabolized  distributed and excreted from the body 
in order to develop commercial products  we will need to conduct research using other compounds that share the key aspects of the prototype compounds but do not have the unsuitable characteristics 
identifying lead compounds may not always be possible 
our current research programs are examples of programs where we have not yet identified lead compounds suitable for drug candidates 
identifying lead compounds may not always be possible 
in addition  our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on new and unsubstantiated technologies 
these risks include the possibility that our new approaches will not result in any products that gain market acceptance  a product candidate will prove to be unsafe or ineffective  or will otherwise fail to receive and maintain regulatory clearances necessary for development and marketing  a product  even if found to be safe and effective  could still be difficult to manufacture on the scale necessary for commercialization or otherwise not be economical to market  a product will unfavorably interact with other types of commonly used medications  thus restricting the circumstances in which it may be used  
table of contents third parties may successfully challenge our proprietary rights protecting a product  proprietary rights of third parties will preclude us from manufacturing or marketing a new product  or third parties will market superior or more cost effective products 
as a result  our activities  either directly or through future corporate partners  may not result in any commercially viable products 
we will depend on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our products 
our resources are limited  and therefore  our business strategy requires us to enter into various arrangements with corporate partners  academic investigators  licensors of technologies  and licensees of our technologies 
in trying to attract corporate partners  we face serious competition from other small pharmaceutical companies and the in house research and development staffs of larger pharmaceutical companies 
if we are unable to enter into such arrangements with corporate partners  our ability to proceed with the research  development  manufacture and or sale of product candidates may be limited 
we may not be successful in attracting corporate partners  or collaborators  over other companies because i their research programs may be more attractive to a collaborator  ii their stage in the research process may be more advanced  iii they may have synergies with the collaborator s existing research programs  or iv they may agree to terms and conditions of the collaboration that are more favorable to the collaborator than we would otherwise agree 
it is common practice in many corporate partnerships in our industry for the larger partner to have responsibility for conducting pre clinical studies and human clinical trials and or preparing and submitting applications for regulatory approval of potential pharmaceutical products 
it is possible that this will be the case with future arrangements of ours 
if one of our collaborative partners fails to develop or commercialize successfully any of our product candidates  we may not be able to remedy this failure and it could negatively affect our business 
furthermore  larger pharmaceutical companies often explore multiple technologies and products for the same medical conditions 
therefore  they are likely to develop or enter into collaborations with our competitors for products addressing the same medical conditions targeted by our technologies 
our collaborators may  therefore  be pursuing alternative technologies or product candidates in order to develop treatments for the diseases or disorders targeted by our collaborative arrangements 
depending on how other product candidates advance  a corporate partner may slow down or abandon its work on our product candidates or terminate its collaborative arrangement with us in order to focus on these other prospects 
we are currently not aware if pfizer  our only large pharmaceutical partner at this time  is pursuing alternative technologies  either through its own research and development capabilities or through other corporate collaborations  for the treatment of neuropathic pain  in addition to the collaboration that we have with pfizer on our naaladase inhibitor technology 
we may be unable to obtain proprietary rights to protect our products and services  permitting competitors to duplicate them 
any success that we have will depend in large part on our ability to obtain  maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our products and processes and to license patent rights from third parties 
intellectual property for our technologies and products will be a crucial factor in our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
large pharmaceutical companies consider a strong patent estate critical when they evaluate whether to enter into a collaborative arrangement to support the research  development and commercialization of a technology 
without the prospect of reasonable intellectual property protection  it 
table of contents would be difficult for a corporate partner to justify the time and money that is necessary to complete the development of a product 
the rules and criteria for receiving and enforcing a patent for pharmaceutical and biotechnological inventions are in flux and are unclear in many respects 
the range of protection given these types of patents is uncertain  and a number of our product candidates are subject to this uncertainty 
many others  including companies  universities and other research organizations  work in our business areas  and we cannot be sure that the claims contained in our issued patents will be interpreted as broadly as we would like in light of the inventions of these other parties 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the claims set forth in our pending patent applications will issue in the form submitted 
these claims may be narrowed or stricken  and the applications may not ever ultimately result in valid and enforceable patents 
thus  we cannot be sure that our patents and patent applications will adequately protect our product candidates 
we are aware of at least one company that has asserted publicly that it has submitted patent applications claiming the use of certain of its immunosuppressive compounds and multi drug resistance compounds for nerve growth applications 
that company also stated that it has issued us patents and pending us applications which claim compounds that may be useful in nerve growth applications 
we cannot give any assurance as to the ability of our patents and patent applications to adequately protect our neurotrophic product candidates 
also  our neurotrophic product candidates may infringe or be dominated by patents that have issued or may issue in the future to third parties 
in order to protect our intellectual property position with respect to our neuroimmunophilin ligands  we filed an opposition in in an effort to prevent the final issuance of a european patent to the company discussed in the above paragraph 
in  we won the opposition and the subject patent was revoked 
however  the patentee has appealed the initial determination and the patent could be reinstated 
furthermore  any or all of the patent applications assigned or licensed to us from third parties may not be granted 
we may not develop additional products or processes that are patentable 
any patents issued to us  or licensed by us  may not provide us with any competitive advantages or adequate protection for our products 
others may successfully challenge  circumvent or invalidate any of our existing or future patents or intellectual property 
we rely on confidentiality agreements to maintain trade secret protection which may not be adhered to or effective 
our policy is to control the disclosure and use of our know how and trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties 
there is a risk  however  that these parties will not honor our confidentiality agreements  disputes will arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality obligations  or disclosure of our trade secrets will occur regardless of these contractual protections 
we may not be able to acquire exclusive rights to inventions or information resulting from work performed under consulting or collaboration agreements 
in our business  we often work with consultants and research collaborators at universities and other research organizations 
if any of these consultants or research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others as part of their work with us  disputes may arise between us and these other parties as to which one of us has the rights to intellectual property related to or resulting from the work done 
we support and collaborate in research conducted in universities  such as johns hopkins  and in governmental research organizations  such as the national institutes of health 
we may not be able to acquire exclusive rights to the inventions or technical information that result from work performed by personnel at these organizations 
also  disputes may arise as to which party should have rights in research programs that we 
table of contents conduct on our own or in collaboration with others that are derived from or related to the work performed at a university or governmental research organization 
in addition  in the event of a contractual breach by us  some of our collaborative research contracts provide that we must return the technology rights  including any patents or patent applications  to the contracting university or governmental research organization 
our products may now or in the future infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  which could result in considerable litigation costs or the loss of the right to use or develop products 
questions of infringement of intellectual property rights  including patent rights  may involve highly technical and subjective analyses 
some or all of our existing or future products or technologies may now or in the future infringe the rights of other parties 
these other parties might initiate legal action against us to enforce their claims  and our defense of the claims might not be successful 
we may incur substantial costs if we must defend against charges of infringement of patent or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may also incur substantial costs if we find it necessary to protect our own patent or proprietary rights by bringing suit against third parties 
we could also lose rights to develop or market products or be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
in response to actual or threatened litigation  we may seek licenses from third parties or attempt to redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement 
we may not be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms  or at all  or successfully redesign our products or processes 
in addition to the risk that we could be a party to patent infringement litigation  the us patent and trademark office could require us to participate in patent interference proceedings  or we may find it necessary to provoke an interference with a third party 
these proceedings are often expensive and time consuming  even if we were to prevail in such proceedings 
we rely on licensed intellectual property for gliadel wafer and our other product candidates  the agreements for which impose requirements on us 
we have licensed intellectual property  including patents  patent applications and know how  from universities and others  including intellectual property underlying gliadel wafer  dopascan injection  aquavan injection and the neuroimmunophilin ligand technology 
some of our product development programs depend on our ability to maintain rights under these licenses 
under the terms of our license agreements  we are generally obligated to exercise diligence in the research and development of these technologies  achieve specified development and regulatory milestones  expend minimum amounts of resources in bringing potential products to market  make specified royalty and milestone payments to the party from which we have licensed the technology  and reimburse patent costs to these parties 
in addition  these license agreements require us to abide by record keeping and periodic reporting obligations 
each licensor has the power to terminate its agreement if we fail to meet our obligations 
if we cannot meet our obligations under these license agreements  we may lose access to our key technology 
if licensed patents covering our products or product candidates are infringed  we generally have the right  but not the obligation  to bring suit against the infringing party 
if we choose to bring suit against an infringing party  the licensor of the technology is generally required to cooperate with the enforcement of the patents that we have licensed 
if we do not choose to bring suit against an infringing party  rights to enforce the licensed patents generally revert to the licensor 
proceeds received from the successful enforcement of our patent rights are generally split between us and the licensor  with the party bringing the suit receiving the more significant portion of those proceeds 

table of contents losing our proprietary rights to our licensed technology would have a significant negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our license agreements for gliadel wafer require us to pay a royalty to mit on sales of gliadel wafer 
similarly  we will have to pay milestone and or royalty payments in connection with the successful development and commercialization of dopascan injection  aquavan injection and any products that result from the neuroimmunophilin ligand technology 
in addition  our us patent protection for gliadel wafer  which as of december   has accounted for approximately of our product sales revenue  expires in from and after that time  there can be no assurance that others will not enter the market with a generic copy of gliadel wafer 
the availability of such a generic copy could negatively impact our revenues from gliadel wafer 
the us government holds rights that may permit it to license to third parties technology we currently hold the exclusive right to use 
the us government holds rights that govern aspects of specific technologies licensed to us by third party licensors 
these government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government funded program may include a non exclusive  royalty free  worldwide license for the government to use resulting inventions for any governmental purpose 
in addition  the us government has the right to grant to others licenses under any of these non exclusive licenses if the government determines that adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions  the grant is necessary to meet public health or safety needs  or the grant is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations 
the us government also has the right to take title to a subject invention if we fail to disclose the invention within specified time limits 
the us government may acquire title in any country in which we do not file a patent application within specified time limits 
federal law requires any licensor of an invention partially funded by the federal government to obtain a commitment from any exclusive licensee  such as us  to manufacture products using the invention substantially in the united states 
further  these rights include the right of the government to use and disclose technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense 
several of our principal technology license agreements contain provisions recognizing these rights 
pre clinical and clinical trial results for our products may not be favorable 
in order to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates  we must conduct both pre clinical studies and human clinical trials 
these studies and trials must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the clinical use for which we are seeking approval 
the results of clinical trials we conduct may not be successful 
adverse results from any clinical trials could have a negative effect on our business 
we also face the risk that we will not be permitted to undertake or continue clinical trials for any of our product candidates in the future 
even if we are able to conduct such trials  we may not be able to demonstrate satisfactorily that the products are safe and effective and thus qualify for the regulatory approvals needed to market and sell them 
results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials are often not accurate indicators of results of later stage clinical trials that involve larger human populations 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which may result in increased costs and significant delays in  or ultimate denial of  approval for our product candidates 
our research  pre clinical development and clinical trials  and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries  including the fda and the dea 
except for gliadel wafer and 
table of contents aggrastat injection  none of our product candidates has received marketing clearance from the fda or any foreign regulatory authority 
as a condition to approval of our product candidates under development  the fda could require additional pre clinical  clinical or other studies 
any requirement that we perform additional studies could delay  or increase the expense of  our product candidates regulatory approval 
this delay or increased expense could have a negative effect on our business 
additionally  to receive regulatory approval  we must also demonstrate that the product is capable of being manufactured in accordance with applicable regulatory standards 
when trying to obtain regulatory approval  significant risk exists that we will not be able to satisfy the fda s requirements with respect to any of our drug product candidates  or even if the fda does approve our product candidates  the fda will approve less than the full scope of uses or labeling that we seek 
failure to obtain regulatory drug approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even if we are able to obtain necessary fda approval  the fda may nevertheless require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the approved product and continued compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fda may withdraw product approvals if we do not maintain compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fda may also withdraw product approvals if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval 
the process of obtaining fda and other required approvals or licenses and of meeting other regulatory requirements to test and market drugs is rigorous and lengthy 
we have expended  and will continue to expend  substantial resources in order to do this 
we will need to conduct clinical trials and other studies on all of our product candidates before we are in a position to file a new drug application for marketing and sales approval 
unsatisfactory clinical trial results and other delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or licenses could prevent the marketing of the products we are developing 
until we receive the necessary approvals or licenses and meet other regulatory requirements  we will not receive revenues or royalties related to product sales 
in addition to the requirements for product approval  before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed and sold in some foreign countries  the proposed pricing for the product must be approved as well 
products may be subject to price controls or limits on reimbursement 
the requirements governing product pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and can be implemented disparately at the national level 
we cannot guarantee that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceuticals will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our products 
because controlled drug products and radio labeled drugs are subject to special regulations in addition to those applicable to other drugs  the dea and the nuclear regulatory commission  or nrc  may regulate some of our products and product candidates  including dopascan injection  as controlled substances and as radio labeled drugs 
the nrc licenses persons who use nuclear materials and establishes standards for radiological health and safety 
the dea is responsible for compliance activities for companies engaged in the manufacture  distribution and dispensing of controlled substances  including the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent such substances from being diverted into illicit channels of commerce 
registration is required and other activities involving controlled substances are subject to a variety of record keeping and security requirements  and to permits and authorizations and other requirements 
states often have requirements for controlled substances as well 
the dea grants certain exceptions from the requirements for permits and authorizations to export or import materials related to or involving controlled substances 
our potential future inability to obtain exceptions from the dea for shipment abroad or other activities could have a negative effect on us 

table of contents we cannot be sure that we will be able to meet applicable requirements to test  manufacture and market controlled substances or radio labeled drugs  or that we will be able to obtain additional necessary approvals  permits  authorizations  registrations or licenses to meet state  federal and international regulatory requirements to manufacture and distribute such products 
our competitors are pursuing alternative approaches to the same conditions we are working on 
our products use novel alternative technologies and therapeutic approaches  which have not been widely studied 
many of our product development efforts focus on novel alternative therapeutic approaches and new technologies that have not been widely studied 
applications for these approaches and technologies include  among other things  the diagnosis and monitoring of parkinson s disease  the promotion of nerve growth and the prevention of neuronal damage 
these approaches and technologies may not be successful 
we are applying these approaches and technologies in our attempt to discover new treatments for conditions that are also the subject of research and development efforts of many other companies 
our competitors may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective or economical than those we are developing  or they may introduce a competitive product before we are able to do so 
rapid technological change or developments by others may result in our technology or product candidates becoming obsolete or noncompetitive 
our business is dependent on our ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes 
the technological areas in which we work continue to evolve at a rapid pace 
our future success depends upon maintaining our ability to compete in the research  development and commercialization of products and technologies in our areas of focus 
competition from pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions is intense and expected to increase 
many of these competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical companies or other companies could enhance the financial  marketing and other resources available to these competitors 
these competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing 
we are aware of the development by other companies and research scientists of alternative approaches to the treatment of malignant glioma  the treatment of acute cardiovascular conditions  the diagnosis of parkinson s disease  the development of a water soluble formulation of propofol  the promotion of nerve growth and repair  and the treatment and prevention of neuronal damage 
our competitors may develop products that make our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
in addition  we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments 
our products must compete with others to gain market acceptance 
for the treatment of malignant glioma  gliadel wafer competes with traditional systemic chemotherapy  radioactive seeds  radiation catheters  temodar capsules  a chemotherapy product manufactured by schering corporation  and other experimental protocols 
aggrastat injection competes directly with integrelin injection  marketed by millennium pharmaceuticals  and reopro  marketed by eli lilly  for the inhibition of platelet aggregation 
any product candidate that we develop and for which we gain regulatory approval must then compete for market acceptance and market share 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of 
table of contents competitive products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we and competing companies can develop products  complete the clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be an important element of market success 
significant competitive factors include capabilities of our collaborators  product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product availability  awareness and acceptance of our products by physicians  marketing and sale capabilities  reimbursement coverage from insurance companies and others  the amount of clinical benefit of our product candidates relative to their cost  the method of administering a product  price  and exclusivity  through patent protection or fda regulations 
our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products or achieve earlier product development completion  patent protection  regulatory approval or product commercialization than we do  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to risks of product liability both because of our product line and our limited insurance coverage 
we may potentially become subject to large liability claims and significant defense costs as a result of the design  manufacture or marketing of our products  including gliadel wafer and aggrastat injection  or the conduct of clinical trials involving our products 
we currently maintain only million of product liability insurance covering clinical trials and product sales 
this existing coverage or any future insurance coverage we obtain may not be adequate 
furthermore  our insurance may not cover a claim made against us 
product liability insurance varies in cost 
it can be difficult to obtain  and we may not be able to purchase it in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may not be able to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims 
product liability claims and or the failure to obtain adequate product liability insurance could prevent or inhibit the clinical development and or commercialization of any products we are developing 
we depend on qualified personnel and consultants  especially craig r 
smith  md we depend heavily on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including craig r 
smith  md  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
we have key man life insurance covering dr 
smith 
dr 
smith has extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry and provides us with unique access to his contacts in the scientific community 
the loss of the services of dr 
smith or other members of our senior management team could have a negative effect on our business 
we have entered into an employment agreement with dr 
smith  which provides protection for our proprietary rights 
nevertheless  he may terminate his relationship with us at any time 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that dr 
smith will remain with us 

table of contents recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  collaborators  advisors and consultants will be critical to our activities 
our planned activities will require personnel and consultants with expertise in many areas including medicinal chemistry and other research specialties  pre clinical testing  clinical trial management  regulatory affairs  intellectual property  sales and marketing  manufacturing  and business development 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel or consultants with these expertise 
furthermore  many pharmaceutical  biotechnology and health care companies and academic and other research institutions compete intensely for personnel and consultants with these expertise 
if we are not able to hire these personnel or consultants  it could have a negative effect on us 
our business involves using hazardous and radioactive materials and animal testing  all of which may result in environmental liability 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials 
we and our partners are subject to extensive laws governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials 
there is a risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
also  we cannot control whether our collaborative partners comply with the governing standards 
if we or our partners do not comply with the governing laws and regulations  we could face significant fines and penalties that could have a negative effect on our business  operations or finances 
in addition  we and or our collaborative partners could be held liable for damages  fines or other liabilities  which could exceed our resources 
we may also have to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
in addition  future environmental laws or regulations may have a negative effect on our operations  business or assets 
many of the research and development efforts we sponsor involve the use of laboratory animals 
changes in laws  regulations or accepted clinical procedures may adversely affect these research and development efforts 
social pressures that would restrict the use of animals in testing or actions against us or our partners by groups or individuals opposed to testing using animals could also adversely affect these research and development efforts 
effecting a change of control of guilford would be difficult  which may discourage offers for shares of our common stock  which may prevent or frustrate any attempt by shareholders to change our direction or management 
our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions include the requirements of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  section prohibits designated types of business combinations  including mergers  for a period of three years between us and any third party who owns or more of our common stock 
this provision does not apply if our board of directors approves of the transaction before the third party acquires of our common stock  
table of contents the third party acquires at least of our common stock at the time its ownership goes past the level  or our board of directors and two thirds of the shares of our common stock not held by the third party vote in favor of the transaction 
we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us 
under the plan  if any person or group acquires more than of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances  our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock  or shares of the acquiring company  at a substantial discount to the public market price 
the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more different series with terms fixed by the board of directors 
stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner 
issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to acquire control of us  as well as prevent or frustrate any attempt by shareholders to change our direction or management 
no shares of our preferred stock are currently outstanding 
while our board of directors has no current intentions or plans to issue any preferred stock  issuance of these shares could also be used as an anti takeover device 
our agreement with paul royalty funds gives paul royalty funds the right to cause us to repurchase its interests at substantial prices in the event of  among other things  a change in control 
our convertible notes are also subject to repurchase  as the option of the holders  upon a change in control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a substantial portion of our assets are investment grade debt instruments such as direct obligations of the us treasury  securities of federal agencies which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the us government  bank certificates of deposit and corporate securities  including commercial paper and corporate debt instruments 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  was million and yield to maturity was approximately 
the weighted average return on our investments during the year ended december  was approximately 
certain of our debt  primarily the million in borrowings from wachovia bank  was established with interest rates which fluctuate with market conditions 
as a hedge against such fluctuations in interest rates  we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements with a commercial bank counter party  to exchange substantially all of our variable rate financial obligations for fixed rate obligations 
as of december   our total long term debt  including the revenue interest obligation  was approximately million 
with respect to million of this debt  we were obligated to pay variable interest rates of libor plus between and 
the interest rate swap agreements had a total notional principal amount of approximately million as of december  pursuant to these interest rate swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate of interest to the counter party and receive from the counter party a variable rate of interest 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is charged or credited  as appropriate to operations 
accordingly  we had fixed interest rates on our december  financial obligations between and 
these interest rate swap agreements have approximately the same maturity dates as the financial obligations and expire on various dates through may we do not speculate on the future direction of interest rates nor do we use these derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
in the event of non performance by the counter party  we could be exposed to market risk related to interest rates 

table of contents the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was a liability of approximately million at december  current market pricing models were used to estimate these fair values
