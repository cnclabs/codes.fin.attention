primary disclosure of the company s significant accounting policies is in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with invoice terms  generally when products are shipped and services are rendered 
the policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at the company s option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
at december   and  the accrual for future warranty obligations was million  million and million  respectively 
the company s expense for warranty obligations approximated million in each of the last three years 
the warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the company s operations  but for the most part do not exceed one year

goodwill and intangible assets 
the company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment at least annually 
as required by sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of january  intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step must be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the company would be required to record such impairment losses 
the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
the company s acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions

ametek accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant elements in determining the company s pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
the pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the year end valuation date 
at the end of each year  the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rate used in determining the pension cost was for us defined benefit pension plans 
the discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at december   and determining the us defined benefit pension plan cost is 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for us defined benefit pension plans for year end and for the pension expense will be 
the rate of compensation increase used in determining the and pension expense for these plans was 
the unrecognized pension loss  which results from the net effect of changes in the assumed discount rate  as well as the effect of differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets  has been deferred and is subject to amortization 
it totaled million for us defined benefit pension plans at december   compared with million at december  this deferred loss will ultimately affect future pension costs

total environmental reserves at december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
in  the company spent approximately million on such environmental matters  compared with approximately million in the company also has agreements with former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses 
under certain of the agreements the former owners retained  or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against  certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances 
the company and some of the other parties carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters 
to date  those parties have met their obligation in all material respects 
the company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their obligation in the future 
however  if the company were required to record a liability with respect to all  or a portion of  such matters on its balance sheet  the effect on income and the amount of the liability would not be significant 
in the opinion of management  based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters  either adequate provision for probable costs has been made  or the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates on its short term debt  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices for certain raw material purchases 
all of the company s long term debt carries fixed rates and its short term debt is variable rate debt 
these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the financial statements 
the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure include the euro  the british pound sterling  and the japanese yen 
exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored  and when possible  mitigated through the use of local borrowings in the foreign country affected 
the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income  within stockholders equity 
foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company 
the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel  copper and steel 
exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product  and purchase order pricing arrangements  although forward contracts may be used in some circumstances to manage some of those exposures 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates  commodity prices  or foreign currency exchange rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are not material  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 
forward looking information certain matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act pslra of  which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company s operations and business environment  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors discussed below  among others  in some cases have caused  and in the future could cause  the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the following include some  but not all  of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from projections an economic slowdown  or unforeseen price reductions in the company s global market segments  with adverse effects on profit margins 
the company s inability to continue achieving its cost reduction objectives  due in part to varying prices and availability of certain raw materials and semifinished materials and components 
this would include the company s inability to obtain certain commodity raw materials  or its inability to recover commodity raw material price increases through higher selling prices 
underutilization of the company s existing factories and plants  or plant expansions or new plants  possibly resulting in production inefficiencies  and higher than anticipated or unanticipated start up expenses and production delays at new plants 
the unanticipated expenses of divesting businesses  or of assimilating newly acquired businesses into the company s business structure  as well as the impact of unusual expenses from business strategies  asset valuations  acquisitions  divestitures and organizational structures 
acquisition and divestiture strategies may face legal and regulatory delays and other unforeseeable obstacles beyond the company s control 
the increased cost of  or inability to obtain  property and liability insurance due to uncertainty in worldwide insurance and reinsurance markets 
the potential write off of substantial goodwill and other intangible assets  including indefinite lived intangible assets 
unpredictable delays or difficulties in the development of key new product programs  and the risk of not recovering major research and development expenses  and or the risks of major technological shifts away from the company s technologies and core competencies 
a prolonged slowing of the growth rate in the us and europe for electric motor products  aerospace  heavy vehicle and process instrumentation  as well as a restriction in the ability of heavy vehicle manufacturers to secure components manufactured by outside suppliers 
rapid or unforeseen escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and or litigation  including but not limited to  environmental compliance  product related liability  assertions related to intellectual property rights and licenses  adoption of new  or changes in  accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices 
the effects  in the united states and abroad  of changes in trade practices  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations  such as trade restrictions or prohibitions  social and economic conditions  unforeseen inflationary pressures and monetary fluctuation  import and other charges or taxes  the inability of the company to obtain  or hedge  foreign currencies  and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates 
this would include extreme currency fluctuations  protectionism and confiscation of assets  nationalizations  unstable governments and legal systems  and intergovernmental disputes 
variation in the level of orders booked  which can be affected by general economic conditions  intensity of competition and continued marketplace acceptance of products 
increased environmental compliance costs  and the potential costs associated with asbestos related litigation 
changes in income tax regulations or tax rates affecting the company 
increased corporate governance compliance costs 
the company believes that it has the product offerings  facilities  personnel and competitive and financial resources for continued business success 
however  future revenues  costs  margins  product mix and profits are all influenced by a number of factors  as discussed above
