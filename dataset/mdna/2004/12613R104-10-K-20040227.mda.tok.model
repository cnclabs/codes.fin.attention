item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview cnet networks  inc is a leading global media company 
known for its editorial expertise  cnet networks combines its award winning content with the power of interactive technology to inform and connect buyers  users and sellers of personal technology  games and entertainment  and business technology 
we have determined that our business segments are us media  international media and channel services 
us media consists of an online network focused on three content categories personal technology  games and entertainment  business technology 
international media includes the delivery of online technology information and several technology and gaming print publications in non us markets 
channel services includes a product database licensing business and an online technology marketplace for resellers  distributors and manufacturers 
as we continue to see a convergence of customer relationships between us media and the channel service product offerings  we will evaluate combining the reporting of the results of the channel services segment within our us media segment in within these business segments  we earn revenues from o marketing services sales of advertisements on our internet network through impression based advertising fees earned from the number of times an advertisement is viewed by users of our websites or activity based advertising fees earned when our users click on an advertisement or text link to visit the websites of our merchant partners  or download a software application or a whitepaper o licensing  fees and users licensing our product database and online content  subscriptions to our online services  and other paid services o publishing sales of advertisements in our print publications  subscriptions and newsstand sales of publications  and custom publishing services 
we evaluate our revenues according to the classifications listed above 
we classify our marketing services revenues and licensing  fee and users revenues as internet revenues and our publishing revenues as publishing revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
revenues for the past three years for these categories are as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues marketing service    licensing  fees and user    internet    publishing    as a percentage of revenues marketing services licensing  fees and user internet publishing we are focused on growing revenues from existing internet properties by increasing revenues from our key customers and expanding our services where we can meet the needs of both users and marketers 
we had over million unique users in the fourth quarter of as compared to million unique users in the fourth quarter of  an increase of 
daily page views averaged million in compared with million in  a increase 
while increases or decreases in unique users and daily average page views are not indicative of increases or decreases in financial results  we believe that these statistics are helpful because they provide insight into the growth of the internet as an advertising medium resulting from increased user adoption and into user demand for cnet networks properties in particular 
we evaluate our financial performance primarily on the following key measurements o revenues o operating income loss o operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment o net income loss o earnings loss per share operating expenses included in our operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment consist of cost of revenues  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs  which are primarily cash related expense activities 
noncash related expenses consist of depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment and are included in our operating income loss 
cost of revenues includes costs associated with the production and delivery of our internet sites  print publications and creation of our product database and related technology 
the principal elements of cost of revenues for our internet operations are payroll and related expenses for the editorial  production and technology staff and related costs for facilities and equipment 
cost of revenues for our publishing operations includes payroll and related expenses for editorial personnel and costs to print and distribute our magazines and related costs for facilities and equipment 
the majority of our cost of revenues do not necessarily fluctuate proportionately with fluctuations in revenues 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  consulting fees and advertising expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment 
general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment 
as shown in the table below  we incurred an operating loss of million  million and billion for the years ended december   and  an operating income before depreciation and amortization of million in and an operating loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment of million and million for and  respectively 
our net loss and net loss per share for each of the periods was million  or per share  million  or per share  and billion  or per share  respectively 
year ended december  in thousands operating loss    depreciation    amortization    asset impairment   operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment    net loss    net loss per share we believe that operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment is useful to management and investors in evaluating our current operating performance  since depreciation  amortization and asset impairment include the impact of past transactions and costs that are not necessarily directly related to the current underlying capital requirements or performance of the business operations 
management refers to operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment to compare historical operating results  in making operating decisions and for planning and compensation purposes 
a limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue 
management evaluates the costs of these assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures 
operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 
outlook the demand for marketing services in the online industry has begun to show signs of improvement 
through the efficiencies we have implemented in the past few years  we believe we have an ability to generate profits from increases in revenues 
we are focused on revenue growth  and we believe that our productivity improvements will result in operating leverage on incremental internet revenues 
we anticipate revenues from our publishing operations to decline due to a decrease in custom publishing arrangements 
we believe there will be continued growth in revenues from marketing services in the personal technology and games and entertainment sectors 
currently  our business technology sector  while exhibiting some growth  was impacted by the continued slow economic environment affecting the enterprise computing industry 
in summary  we believe that any decline in our custom publishing arrangements will be more than offset by increases in our internet revenue growth rates so that we will be able to achieve a higher level of growth in both profits and cash flow compared to results of operations vs

an impairment charge of million for goodwill and million for intangible assets of that reporting unit was recorded in the third quarter of also included in asset impairment and disposals was a loss on disposal of fixed assets of million

this was offset by noncash operating expenses of approximately million  which was primarily depreciation  amortization and asset impairment

during  financing activities included a use of cash of approximately million related to the retirement of debt 
cash flows provided by financing activities in of million were primarily related to the exercise of options 
as of december   we had obligations outstanding under notes payable totaling million 
notes payable included million of convertible subordinated notes  due march although we have not presently identified alternate or additional sources of long term capital  if our cash needs were to change  or if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our convertible subordinated notes by when they are due  we will need to raise additional capital through debt or equity offerings in the public or private markets 
our ability to raise such additional capital will depend on market conditions at that time 
as of december   our aggregate cash balances totaled million  consisting of million cash and equivalents  short term and long term investments in marketable debt securities as well as million of restricted cash 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to cover operations and for working capital fluctuations and for capital expenditures for the next months 
however  any significant acquisitions completed in the future may require cash and may affect our liquidity and funding needs 
obligations cnet s obligations with respect to the convertible subordinated notes due can be found in the indenture for such notes filed as exhibit to cnet s annual report on k for the year ended december  the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than l year years after years long term debt non cancellable operating lease obligations capital lease obligations the caption non cancelable operating lease obligations in the above table not only includes our rent obligations on all of our occupied properties  but also includes our liability under our abandoned leases of million

in connection with that guarantee  we also have a letter of credit for million outstanding as a security deposit 
as there is no present obligation to make any payments in connection with this guarantee  we have not recorded any liability for this guarantee in our financial statements

through a sublease from ziff davis media inc  cnet currently occupies  square feet of the office space covered under this lease 
ziff davis media inc currently occupies  square feet of this space 
there are three additional subleases  the bank of new york  fojp risk management and softbank  who collectively occupy a total of  square feet

as of december   the total minimum lease payments remaining until the end of the lease term were million  excluding the amounts attributable to cnet s sublease 
if the financial condition of any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make their lease payments  cnet would be required to make their lease payments under the guarantee 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to collectibility of receivables  investments  goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues once the following criteria are met o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists o delivery of our obligation to our customer has occurred o the price to be charged to the buyer is fixed or determinable o collectibility of the fees to be charged is reasonably assured we have several revenue streams 
for each revenue stream  evidence of the arrangement  delivery and pricing may be different 
for all revenue streams  we determine that collectibility is reasonably assured through a standardized credit review to determine each customer s credit worthiness 
marketing services we recognize revenues from the sale of impression based advertisements on our online network in the period in which the advertisements are delivered 
the arrangements are evidenced either by insertion order or contract that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered and pricing 
our customers are billed based on a discounted list price with no amounts subject to refund 
when recognizing revenues  the discounts granted are applied to each type of advertisement purchased based on the relative fair value of each element 
we refer to the fees charged to merchants based on the number of users who click on an advertisement or text link to visit websites of our merchant partners as activity based advertising 
for activity based advertising  the arrangement is evidenced by a contract that stipulates the fee per activity 
the fee becomes fixed and determinable upon delivery of a user clicking on an advertisement 
these revenues are recognized in the period in which the activity occurs and are therefore not subject to refund 
in certain arrangements  we sell multiple deliverables to customers as part of a multiple element arrangement 
for these arrangements  we allocate revenue to each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each deliverable 
revenue is recognized in these arrangements as we deliver on our obligation 
we trade advertising on our internet sites in exchange for marketing services of other companies  referred to as barter revenue 
these revenues are recognized in the period in which the advertisements are delivered based on the fair market value of the services delivered 
we determine the fair market value of the service delivered based upon amounts charged for similar services in non barter deals within the previous six month period 
licensing  fees and users revenues for subscriptions to our internet sites  print publications  product database and procurement services are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription 
upon execution of a contract  billing and commencement of the services  we record deferred revenue for the fee charged 
this deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the arrangement 
the amounts under contract are not refundable after the customer has used the service 
publishing advertising revenues from our print and custom print publications are recognized in the month that the related publications are sent to subscribers or become available at newsstands 
newsstand revenue from our print publications is recognized when the publications are delivered to the newsstand at which time a reserve is recorded against the value of the publications delivered based on the number of magazines that we expect to be returned 
to ensure these reserves are adequate  we review the sell through history of the publications on a monthly basis 
collectibility of receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our allowances on periodic assessment of our customer s liquidity and financial condition through credit rating agencies reports  financial statement reviews and historical collection trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
goodwill and intangibles impairment effective january  under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are to be tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with definite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
although the provisions of sfas were not effective in their entirety until january   the goodwill acquired in business combinations which occurred after september  fell under the condition of sfas requiring no amortization of goodwill arising from transactions completed after june  therefore  goodwill arising from any such transactions has not been amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets of a reporting unit are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of reporting unit goodwill is evaluated based on a comparison of the reporting unit s carrying value to the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
conditions that indicate that impairment of goodwill should be evaluated include a sustained decrease in our market value or an adverse change in business climate 
on an ongoing basis  we will review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis with a valuation date of august having been established as the date on which this annual review will take place 
contingencies we evaluate whether a liability must be recorded for contingencies based on whether a liability is probable and estimable 
our most significant contingencies are related to our ongoing mysimon litigation and our lease guarantee for office space in new york city as described in item legal proceedings and note of
