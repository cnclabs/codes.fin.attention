item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is the most significant accounting policy for the company 
the company recognizes revenue from time and material contracts as services are performed 
during the years ended december  and  revenues from time and material contracts constituted and  respectively of total revenues 
revenue from fixed price  application management  maintenance and support engagements is recognized as earned  which generally results in straight line revenue recognition as services are performed continuously over the term of the engagement 
during the years ended december   and  revenues from fixed price application management and support engagements constituted and  respectively 
revenue on fixed price development projects is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting 
performance is generally measured based upon the efforts incurred to date in relation to the total estimated efforts to the completion of the contract 
the company monitors estimates of total contract revenues and cost on a routine basis throughout the delivery period 
the cumulative impact of any change in estimates of the contract revenues or costs is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event that a loss is anticipated on a particular contract  provision is made for the estimated loss 
the company issues invoices related to fixed price contracts based on either the achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms 
differences between the timing of billings and the recognition of revenue based upon the proportional performance method of accounting are recorded as revenue earned in excess of billings or deferred revenue in the accompanying financial statements 
during the years ended december  and  revenues from fixed price development contracts constituted and  respectively 
significant accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
the use of the proportional performance method of accounting requires that we make estimates about our future efforts and costs relative to our fixed price contracts 
while we have procedures in place to monitor the estimates throughout the performance period  such estimates are subject to change as each contract progresses 
the cumulative impact of any such changes is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific review of aged receivables 
the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million respectively 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the probable collection from specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  analysis of credit data  bad debt write offs  and other known factors 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates and reserves for tax contingencies 
when preparing our financial statements  we record our provisions for income taxes based on tax laws and regulations in each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business in determining the tax provisions  the company also provides reserves for tax contingencies based on the company s assessment of future regulatory reviews of filed tax returns 
such reserves are recorded in income taxes payable and are based on management s estimates and accordingly are subject to revision based on additional information and are dependent upon the judgment of regulatory reviews 
accruals for legal exposures 
the company estimates the costs associated with legal exposures that it has and the related legal expenses and records the probable liability if it can be reasonably estimated or the lower end of a range  if the amount cannot be reasonably estimated 
the accrual related to litigation and legal fees at december  and  was million and million  respectively

the company re skilled a very significant percentage of the consulting base during  and in the latest advanced software platforms  including java  html  object oriented  c  rmi cobra  jdbc  cold fusion  and oracle 
the company has focused training efforts on consultants assigned to teamsourcing engagements  and as a result  has successfully migrated such consultants to the growing e business segment 
historically  most e business engagements were billed on a time and materials basis under the direct supervision of the customer similar to teamsourcing engagements  however  as the company expanded its expertise in delivering e commerce engagements  syntel has assumed the project management role and entered into fixed price arrangements for a significant number of new e business engagements started during  and for the years ended december   and  fixed price revenues from development and maintenance activity comprised approximately  and of total e business revenues  respectively 
on teamsourcing engagements  syntel s professional services typically are provided at the customer s site and under the direct supervision of the customer 
teamsourcing revenues generally are recognized on a time and materials basis as services are performed 
as indicated in the above table  the company s dependence on teamsourcing engagements has decreased significantly and is expected to continue to decrease as a percentage of the total revenue base as the company consciously refocuses its sales efforts and migrates resources to e business and applications outsourcing engagements 
the company s most significant cost is personnel cost  which consists of compensation  benefits  recruiting  relocation and other related costs for its it professionals 
the company strives to maintain its gross margin by migrating more revenue toward applications outsourcing and e business  controlling engagement costs  and offsetting increases in salaries and benefits with increases in billing rates

net revenues increased from million in to million in  representing an increase 
our revenues have increased primarily consequent to our increased workforce 
information technology offshoring is clearly becoming a mega trend with increasing numbers of global corporations aggressively outsourcing their crucial applications development or business processes to vendors with an offshore presence 
syntel too has benefited from this trend 
worldwide billable headcount  including personnel employed by syntel india  syntel singapore  syntel europe  and syntel germany as of december  increased to  employees as compared to  employees as of december  however  the growth in revenues was not commensurate with the growth in the billable headcount 
this is primarily because a significant growth in the billable headcount was in india  where our recoveries per off shore billable resource is generally lower as compared to an on site based resource 
as of december   the company had approximately of its billable workforce in india as compared to as of december  further  revenue generation from these additional billable headcounts started primarily during the second half of the year the company also decreased its dependence on its larger customers 
the top five customers accounted for of the total revenues in  down from of the total revenues in moreover  the top customers accounted for of the revenues in as compared to in applications outsourcing revenues

this resulted in a lower cost of revenues during and contributes approximately to the increase during e business revenues 
e business revenues increased from million in  or of total consolidated revenues  to million in  or of total consolidated revenues 
during  the company had granted a sales incentive to a significant customer of million as compared to only million during  a decrease of million

as a result of the continued uncertainty and weakness in the global economic and political environment  companies continue to seek to outsource their it spending offshore 
however  the company also sees clients needs to reduce their costs and the increased competitive environment among it companies 
the company expects these conditions to continue in the next few quarters 
in response to the continued pricing pressures and increased competition for outsourcing clients  the company continues to focus on expanding its service offerings into areas with higher and sustainable price margins  on managing its cost structure  and on anticipating and correcting for decreased demand  and skill and pay level imbalances in its personnel 
the company s immediate measures include increased management of compensation expenses through headcount management and variable compensation plans  as well as increasing utilization rates or reducing non deployed sub contractors or non billable it professionals

after considering the impact of non recurring items  the selling  general  and administrative expenses are at and of total revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily on account of increase in revenue in over the factors  which affect the fluctuations in our allowance for doubtful accounts and write offs of uncollectible accounts include the financial health and economic environment of our clients 
no one client has contributed significantly to a loss and we have had no significant changes in our collection policies or payment terms

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we consider investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of less than three months at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities in thousands december  december  assets cash and cash equivalents   investments  marketable securities   total   our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investments are in high quality indian mutual funds and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
at any time  changes in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  or we may suffer a loss in principal if we are forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as stated above 
foreign currency risk our sales are primarily sourced in the united states and our subsidiary in the united kingdom and are mostly denominated in us dollars or uk pounds respectively 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the risk is partially mitigated as the company has sufficient resources in the respective local currencies to meet immediate requirements 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations 
during  the indian rupee has appreciated by as compared to  which has marginally reduced the company s gross margin by 
the indian rupee denominated cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative cost was and  respectively  which did not have a significant impact 
although the company cannot predict future movement in interest rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates  the company does not currently anticipate that interest rate risk or foreign currency risk will have a significant impact
