the most significant impact of recording the assets and liabilities at fair value going forward  as compared to pre acquisition operations  are expected to be higher depreciation expense due to the step up of depreciable assets  assignment of purchase price to certain amortizable intangible assets  and lower interest costs though not cash payments for the remaining life of debt due to its revaluation and related debt premium amortization 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
the seasonal nature of southern union s business results in a high level of cash flow needs to finance gas purchases and other energy costs  outstanding customer accounts receivable and certain tax payments 
additionally  significant cash flow needs may be required to finance current debt service obligations 
to provide these funds  as well as funds for its continuing construction and maintenance programs  the company has historically used cash flows from operations and its credit facilities 
because of available credit and the ability to obtain various types of market financing  combined with anticipated cash flows from operations  management believes it has adequate financial flexibility and access to financial markets to meet its short term cash needs 
the company has increased the scale of its natural gas transportation  storage and distribution operations and the size of its customer base by pursuing and consummating business acquisitions 
on june   the company acquired panhandle energy see note ii acquisitions and sales 
acquisitions require a substantial increase in expenditures that may need to be financed through cash flow from operations or future debt and equity offerings 
the availability and terms of any such financing sources will depend upon various factors and conditions such as the company s combined cash flow and earnings  the company s resulting capital structure  and conditions in the financial markets at the time of such offerings 
acquisitions and financings also affect the company s combined results due to factors such as the company s ability to realize any anticipated benefits from the acquisitions  successful integration of new and different operations and businesses  and effects of different regional economic and weather conditions 
future acquisitions or related acquisition financing or refinancing may involve the issuance of shares of the company s common stock  which could have a dilutive effect on the then current stockholders of the company

critical accounting policies 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience  current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of those policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note i summary of significant accounting policies 
effects of regulation the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its distribution segment  has accounting policies which conform to the fasb standard  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and revenues on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred assets and liabilities are then flowed through the results of operations in the period in which the same amounts are included in rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the consolidated balance sheet and included in the consolidated statement of operations for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
the aggregate amount of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets are  and  at june  and  and  at june   respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangibles comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates about the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation methods and useful lives 
the company also reviews these assets for impairment on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of an asset s fair value with its carrying value  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in an amount equal to that excess 
management s determination of an asset s fair value requires it to make long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the asset  when the asset s fair value is not readily apparent from other sources 
these forecasts require assumptions about future demand  future market conditions and regulatory developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
during june  the company evaluated goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows attributable to the company s reporting units that have goodwill  as compared to the carrying value of those reporting units net assets 
as of june   pursuant to the fasb standard  goodwill and other intangible assets  no impairment had been indicated 
in connection with the company s cash flow improvement plan announced in july  the company began the divestiture of certain non core assets 
as a result of prices of comparable businesses for various non core properties and pursuant to the fasb standard  impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of  a goodwill impairment loss of  was recognized in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended september  investments in securities as of june   all securities owned by the company are accounted for under the cost method 
these securities consist of common and preferred stock in non public companies whose value is not readily determinable 
a judgmental aspect of accounting for these securities involves determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has been sustained 
management reviews these securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors that are considered in assessing whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  but are not limited to earnings trends and asset quality  near term prospects and financial condition of the issuer  financial condition and prospects of the issuer s region and industry  and southern union s intent and ability to retain the investment 
if management determines that a decline in value is other than temporary  a charge will be recorded on the consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying value of the investment security to its estimated fair value 
in september and june  southern union determined that declines in the value of its investment in pointserve were other than temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded non cash charges of  and  during the quarters ended september  and june   respectively  to reduce the carrying value of this investment to its estimated fair value 
the company recognized these valuation adjustments to reflect significant lower private equity valuation metrics and changes in the business outlook of pointserve 
pointserve is a closely held  privately owned company and  as such  has no published market value 
the company s remaining investment of  at june  may be subject to future market value risk 
the company will continue to monitor the value of its investment and periodically assess the impact  if any  on reported earnings in future periods 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company accounts for pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with the fasb standards employers accounting for pensions and employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these statements require liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet at the present value of these future obligations to employees net of any plan assets 
the calculation of these liabilities and associated expenses require the expertise of actuaries and are subject to many assumptions including life expectancies  present value discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs 
any change in these assumptions can significantly change the liability and associated expenses recognized in any given year 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its distribution segment in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate 
derivatives and hedging activities the company utilizes derivative instruments on a limited basis to manage certain business risks 
interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks are used to reduce interest rate risks and to manage interest expense 
commodity swaps have been utilized to manage price risk associated with certain energy contracts 
the company accounts for its derivatives in accordance with the fasb standard  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
under this statement  all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
on the date the derivative contract is entered into  management designates the derivative as either i a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  ii a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid in connection with a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or iii an instrument that is held for trading or non hedging purposes a trading or non hedging instrument 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value hedge  along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction eg  until periodic settlements of a variable rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings 
hedge ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings immediately 
lastly  changes in the fair value of derivative trading and non hedging instruments are reported in current period earnings 
fair value is determined based upon mathematical models using current and historical data 
the company formally assesses  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods 
the company discontinues hedge accounting when i it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  ii the derivative expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  iii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  or iv management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding  the company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet  recognizing changes in the fair value in current period earnings 
see note xi derivative instruments and hedging activities 
commitments and contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental and other matters 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgments by management regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
for further discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies  see note xviii commitments and contingencies 
purchase accounting the company s acquisition of panhandle energy has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the fasb standard  business combinations 
under this statement  the purchase price paid by the company  including transaction costs  was allocated to panhandle energy s net assets as of the acquisition date 
the panhandle energy assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date based on the results of outside appraisals 
determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the accounting rules provide a one year period following the consummation of an acquisition to finalize the fair value estimates 
accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the statement i clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  ii clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  iii amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to language used in fasb interpretation guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and iv amends certain other existing pronouncements 
the statement did not materially change the methods the company uses to account for and report its derivatives and hedging activities 
effective july   the company adopted the fasb standard  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement establishes guidelines on how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in december  the fasb issued consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation introduced a new consolidation model  which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation 
the interpretation requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company is allocated a majority of the entity s gains and or losses  including fees paid by the entity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has long term debt and revolving credit facilities  which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at june   the company had issued fixed rate long term debt aggregating  in principal amount excluding premiums on panhandle energy s debt of  and having a fair value of  these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately  if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at june  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
the company s floating rate obligations aggregated  at june  and primarily consisted of the term note  the debt assumed under the panhandle acquisition related to the trunkline lng facility  and amounts borrowed under the long term facility 
the floating rate obligations under the term note and the long term facility expose the company to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the floating rates were to increase by from june  levels  the company s consolidated interest expense would increase by a total of approximately  each month in which such increase continued 
the risk of an economic loss is reduced at this time as a result of the company s regulated status with respect to its distribution segment operations
