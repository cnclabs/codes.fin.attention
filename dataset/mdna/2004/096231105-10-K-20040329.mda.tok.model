item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition certain definitions  cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless otherwise indicated in this discussion and throughout this annual report  references to real estate and to inventories collectively encompass the inventories held for sale by bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities reform act of the act and are making the following statements pursuant to the act to do so 
certain statements in this annual report and our other filings with the sec constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act  and section e of the securities exchange act 
you may identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  intend  expect  anticipate  believe will  should  project  estimate  plan or other comparable terminology or by other statements that do not relate to historical facts 
all statements  trend analyses and other information relative to the market for our products  remaining life of project sales  our expected future sales  financial position  operating results  liquidity and capital resources  our business strategy  financial plan and expected capital requirements as well as trends in our operations or results are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  including changes in economic conditions  generally  in areas where we operate  or in the travel and tourism industry  increases in interest rates  changes in regulations and other factors discussed throughout our sec filings  all of which could cause our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry trends  to differ materially from any future results  performance  or achievements or trends expressed or implied herein 
given these uncertainties  investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements and no assurance can be given that the plans  estimates and expectations reflected herein will be achieved 
factors that could adversely affect our future results can also be considered general risk factors with respect to our business  whether or not they relate to a forward looking statement 
we wish to caution you that the important factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
our continued liquidity depends on our ability to sell or borrow against our notes receivable 
we offer financing of up to of the purchase price to purchasers of vois or homesites 
our customers financed approximately of the aggregate sales price of the vois and of the aggregate sales price of the homesites sold by us during the year ended december  using our inhouse financing 
however  we incur selling  marketing and administrative cash expenditures prior to and concurrent with the sale 
these costs generally exceed the downpayment we receive at the time of the sale 
accordingly  our ability to borrow against or sell the notes receivable we receive from our customers is a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
we generally pledge the receivables arising from our sales of vois to institutional lenders 
we are also a party to a number of customary securitization type transactions under which we sell receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity which  in turn  sells the receivables either directly to third parties or to a trust established for the transaction 
if our pledged receivables facilities terminate or expire and we are unable to replace them with comparable facilities  or if we are unable to continue in our participation in securitizations of the type to which we are currently a party  our liquidity and cash flow would be materially and adversely affected 
if any of our current facilities terminate or expire  there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the pledge or sale of such customer notes at favorable rates  or at all 
we depend on additional funding to finance our operations 
we anticipate that we will finance our future business activities  in whole or in part  with indebtedness that we obtain pursuant to additional borrowings under our existing credit facilities  under credit facilities that we may obtain in the future or under securitizations in which we may participate in the future 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on attractive terms  or at all 
moreover  we will be required to seek external sources of liquidity to o support our operations  o finance the acquisition and development of voi inventory and residential land  o finance a substantial percentage of our sales  and o satisfy our debt and other obligations 
our ability to service or to refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing including our ability to consummate future notes receivable securitizations depends on our future performance  which is subject to a number of factors  including our business  results of operations  leverage  financial condition and business prospects  prevailing interest rates  general economic conditions and perceptions about the residential land and vacation ownership industries 
our success depends on our ability to market our products efficiently 
we compete for customers with other hotel and resort properties and vacation ownership resorts 
accordingly  the identification of sales prospects and leads  and the marketing of our products to them are essential to our success 
we have expended and expect to continue to expend significant amounts of our resources to identify and capitalize on future customers and upgrade opportunities 
among our marketing initiatives  we utilize our proprietary computer software system to identify and target leads 
the leads we identify are then contacted and given the opportunity to purchase mini vacation packages which may sometimes combine hotel stays  cruises and gift premiums 
buyers of these mini vacation packages are then usually required to participate in a vacation ownership sales presentation 
we have incurred and will incur the expenses associated with these and our other marketing programs in advance of closing sales to the leads that we identify 
if our lead identification and marketing efforts do not yield enough leads that we are able successfully to convert to a sufficient number of sales  we may be unable to recover the value of our investment in our marketing programs and systems and our business may be adversely effected 
we would incur substantial losses if the customers we finance default on their obligations to pay the balance of the purchase price 
under the terms of our pledged receivables facilities  we may be required  under certain circumstances  to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan to value ratios if our pledged receivables become delinquent 
additionally  the terms of our securitization type transactions require us to repurchase or replace loans if we breach any of the representations and warranties we made at the time we sold the receivables 
further  if defaults and other performance criteria differ from estimates used to value our retained interests in notes receivable sold in the securitization transactions  we may have to write down these assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as servicer of the notes  we may also be required to advance delinquent payments to the extent we deem them recoverable 
accordingly  we bear some risk of delinquencies and defaults by buyers who finance the purchase of their vois or residential land through us  regardless of whether or not we sell or pledge the customer s loan to a third party 
as of december   approximately of our vacation ownership receivables and approximately of residential land receivables which we held or which third parties held under sales transactions which are serviced by us were more than days past due 
although in many cases we may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price  certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans or the cost of doing so may not be justified 
historically we have not exercised such recourse against our customers 
if we are unable to collect the defaulted amount or to obtain a voluntary quitclaim to the interest  if applicable  we will be required to foreclose on or otherwise seek recovery of the customer s collateral and then remarket the recovered property 
irrespective of our remedy in the event of a default  we cannot recover the marketing  selling  and administrative costs associated with the original sale and we would have to incur such costs again to resell the voi or homesite 
we are subject to the risks of the real estate market 
real estate markets are cyclical in nature and highly sensitive to changes in national and regional economic conditions  including o levels of unemployment  o levels of discretionary disposable income  o levels of consumer confidence  o the availability of financing  o overbuilding or decreases in demand  o interest rates  and o our ability to identify and enter into agreements with strategic marketing partners 
a downturn in the economy in general or in the market for residential land or vois could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not successfully execute our growth strategy 
a principal component of our growth strategy is to acquire additional real estate for the development of vois or completed vois 
we seek to acquire properties in destinations that we believe will complement our existing operations 
our ability to execute this growth strategy will depend upon a number of factors  including the following o the availability of attractive resort development opportunities  o our ability to acquire properties for such development opportunities on economically feasible terms  o our ability to market and sell vois at newly developed or acquired resorts  and o our ability to manage newly developed or acquired resorts in a manner that results in customer satisfaction 
in particular  the success of our bluegreen vacation club will depend upon our ability to continue to acquire and develop a sufficient number of participating resorts to make membership interests attractive to consumers and to permit the continued growth of our vacation club s membership 
there is no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any or all of these factors 
we may face a variety of risks when we expand our operations 
our growth strategy includes the expansion of the number of our resorts 
risks associated with such expansion include the following o construction costs may exceed original estimates  o inability to complete construction  conversion or required legal registrations and approvals as scheduled  o inability to control the timing  quality and completion of any construction activity  o our quarterly results may fluctuate due to an increase or decrease in the number of residential land or voi projects subject to percentage of completion accounting  which requires that we recognize profit on projects on a pro rata basis as development is completed  o market demand may not be present  and o declining values of our inventories 
any of the foregoing could make any expansion less profitable 
there is no assurance that we will complete all of our planned expansion of our properties or  if completed  that such expansion will be profitable 
moreover  to successfully implement our growth strategy  we must integrate the newly acquired or developed properties into our existing sales and marketing programs 
during the start up phase of a new resort or residential community project  we could experience lower operating margins at that project until its operations mature 
the lower margins could be substantial and could negatively impact our cash flow 
we cannot provide assurance that we will maintain or improve our operating margins as our projects achieve maturity and our new resorts and communities may reduce our overall operating margins 
excessive claims for development related defects could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we engage third party contractors to construct our resorts and to develop our communities 
however  our customers may assert claims against us for construction defects or other perceived development defects  including structural integrity  the presence of mold as a result of leaks or other defects  asbestos  electrical issues  plumbing issues  road construction  water and sewer defects  etc 
in addition  certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to development defects discovered in the future 
a significant number of claims for development related defects could adversely affect our liquidity  financial condition  and operating results 
we may face additional risks as we expand into new markets 
we currently intend to acquire real estate for the development of vois or completed vois for bluegreen resorts both in the geographic areas where bluegreen resorts currently operates and in other areas 
bluegreen communities intends to acquire real estate in the geographic areas where it currently operates as well as other areas where we anticipate successful sales of homesites in residential communities 
our prior success in the markets in which we currently operate does not ensure our continued success as we acquire  develop or operate future projects in new markets 
accordingly  in connection with expansion into new markets  we may be exposed to a number of additional risks  including the following o our lack of familiarity and understanding of local consumer preferences  o our inability to attract  hire  train  and retain additional sales  marketing  and resort staff at competitive costs  o our inability to obtain  or to obtain in a timely manner  necessary permits and approvals from state and local government agencies and qualified construction services at acceptable costs  o our inability to capitalize on new marketing relationships and development agreements  and o the uncertainty involved in  and additional costs associated with  marketing vois and homesites prior to completion of marketed units 
bluegreen communities primarily depends on third party lenders to finance the purchase of homesites as the majority of our residential land sales are currently financed by customers through local banks and finance companies 
a decrease in the willingness of such lenders to extend financing to our customers could cause a decline in our sales or require material additional credit facilities in order to enable us to provide financing to our customers 
the limited resale market for vois could adversely affect our business 
based on our experience at our resorts and at destination resorts owned by third parties  we believe that resales of vois generally are made at net sales prices below their original customer purchase price 
the relatively lower sales price is partly attributable to the high marketing and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such vois 
accordingly  the initial purchase of a voi may be less attractive to prospective buyers 
also  buyers who seek to resell their vois compete with our efforts to sell our vois 
while voi resale clearing houses or brokers currently do not have a material impact on our business  if a secondary market for vois were to become more organized and liquid  the resulting availability of resale vois at lower prices could adversely affect our prices and the number of sales we can close  which in turn would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations affect the way we conduct our business 
the federal government and the states and local jurisdictions in which we conduct business have enacted extensive regulations that affect the manner in which we market and sell vois and homesites and conduct our other business operations 
in addition  many states have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of vois and homesites 
these laws and regulations require us  among other things  to obtain and file numerous documents and supporting information with the responsible state agency to obtain the agency s approval for an offering statement that describes all material aspects of the sale of vois  and to deliver an offering statement or public report  together with certain additional information concerning the terms of the purchase  to all prospective purchasers of a voi 
most states also have other laws that regulate our activities  such as o real estate licensure laws  o travel sales licensure laws  o anti fraud laws  o consumer protection laws  o telemarketing laws and o prize  gift  and sweepstakes laws 
we currently are authorized to market and sell vois and homesites in all states in which our operations are currently located 
if our agents or employees violate these regulations or licensing requirements  their acts or omissions could cause the states where the violations occurred to revoke or refuse to renew our licenses  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  the federal government and the states and local jurisdictions in which we conduct business have enacted extensive regulations relating to direct marketing and telemarketing generally  including the federal government s recently enacted national do not call list 
the regulations have impacted our marketing of vois and we have taken steps in an attempt to decrease our dependence on restricted calls 
however  these steps have increased and are expected to continue to increase our marketing costs 
we cannot predict the impact that these legislative initiatives or any other legislative measures that may be proposed or enacted now or in the future may have on our marketing strategies and results 
we believe we are in material compliance with applicable federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the sale and marketing of vois and homesites 
from time to time  however  consumers file complaints against us in the ordinary course of our business 
we could be required to incur significant costs to resolve these complaints 
there is no assurance that we will remain in material compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  or that violations of applicable laws will not have adverse implications for us  including  negative public relations  potential litigation  and regulatory sanctions 
the expense  negative publicity  and potential sanctions associated with any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
environmental liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our business 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as common law  we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances  including mold  located on  in  or emanating from property that we own  lease  or operate  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage at such property 
these laws often impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our property or to borrow money using such real property as collateral 
noncompliance with environmental  health or safety requirements may require us to cease or alter operations at one or more of our properties 
further  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of our properties 
we could incur costs to comply with laws governing accessibility of facilities by disabled persons 
a number of state and federal laws  including the fair housing act and the americans with disabilities act  impose requirements related to access and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities 
although we believe our resorts are substantially in compliance with laws governing accessibility by disabled persons  we may incur additional costs to comply with such laws at our existing or subsequently acquired resorts 
additional federal  state  and local legislation with respect to access by disabled persons may impose further burdens or restrictions on us 
we cannot forecast the ultimate cost of compliance with such legislation  but such costs could be substantial and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if our estimates concerning our notes receivable are incorrect 
a portion of our revenues historically has been and is expected to continue to be comprised of gains on sales of notes receivable 
the amount of any gains recognized and the fair value of the retained interests recorded are based in part on management s best estimates of future prepayment  default and loss severity rates  discount rates and other considerations in light of then current conditions 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if o actual prepayments with respect to loans sold occur more quickly than was projected  o actual defaults and or loss severity rates with respect to loans sold are greater than estimated  or o the portfolio of receivables sold fails to satisfy specified performance criteria or in certain other circumstances 
in any of these events  the cash flow on the retained interests in notes receivable sold could be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
if these situations were to occur  it could cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to earnings currently 
executive overview we operate through two business segments 
bluegreen resorts develops  markets and sells vois in our resorts  through the bluegreen vacation club  and provides resort management services to resort property owners associations 
bluegreen communities acquires large tracts of real estate  which are subdivided  improved in some cases to include a golf course on the property and sold  typically on a retail basis  as homesites 
we are pursuing a strategy designed to further the continued growth and profitability of bluegreen resorts while maintaining the positive cash flow and the stability of earnings of bluegreen communities 
we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our gross revenues and net earnings 
this seasonality may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  with the majority of our gross revenues and net earnings historically occurring in the quarters ending in june and september each year 
other material fluctuations in operating results may occur due to the timing of development and the requirement that we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method of income recognition  income is recognized as work progresses 
measures of progress are based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to expected total costs 
we expect that we will continue to invest in projects that will require substantial development with significant capital requirements  and hence that our results of operations may fluctuate significantly between quarterly and annual periods as a result of the required use of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we do not believe that inflation and changing prices currently have had a material impact on our revenues and results of operations  other than to the extent that we continually review and have historically increased the sales prices of our vois annually 
based on prior experience  we do not expect that inflation will have a material impact on our revenues or results of operations in the foreseeable future  although there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase our sales prices or that increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on our gross profit 
to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of our debt service costs may be affected  as well as the interest rates we charge our customers 
we have historically adjusted the interest rates charged on bluegreen communities notes receivable from customers as market rates changed  but have not adjusted the interest rates charged on notes receivable from bluegreen resorts customers due to market rate fluctuations 
we believe that the recent hostilities in the middle east and other world events that have decreased the amount of vacation air travel by americans have not  to date  had a material adverse impact on our sales in our domestic sales offices 
with the exception of the la cabana beach and racquet club in aruba  guests at our bluegreen vacation club destination resorts more typically drive  rather than fly  to these resorts due to the accessibility of the resorts 
there can be no assurance  however  that a long term decrease in air travel or increase in anxiety regarding actual or possible future terrorist attacks or other world events will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods 
we recognize revenue on homesite and voi sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash  the refund or rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development of the real estate sold 
in cases where all development has not been completed  we recognize income in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
costs associated with the acquisition and development of vacation ownership resorts and residential communities  including carrying costs such as interest and taxes  are capitalized as inventory and are allocated to cost of real estate sold as the respective revenues are recognized 
a portion of our revenues historically has been and is expected to continue to be comprised of gains on sales of notes receivable 
the gains are recorded on our consolidated statement of income and the related retained interests in the notes receivable sold are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale 
the amount of gains recognized and the fair value of the retained interests recorded are based in part on management s best estimates of future prepayment  default rates  loss severity rates  discount rates and other considerations in light of then current conditions 
if actual prepayments with respect to loans occur more quickly than we projected at the time such loans were sold  as can occur when interest rates decline  interest would be less than expected and may cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to operations 
if actual defaults or other factors discussed above with respect to loans sold are greater than estimated  charge offs would exceed previously estimated amounts and the cash flow from the retained interests in notes receivable sold would decrease 
also  to the extent the portfolio of receivables sold fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to  for example  an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or certain other events occur  the funds received from obligors must be distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow to us from the retained interests in notes receivable sold would be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
if these situations were to occur on a material basis  it could cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to earnings currently 
there is no assurance that the carrying value of our retained interests in notes receivable sold will be fully realized or that future loan sales will be consummated or  if consummated  result in gains 
see vacation ownership receivables purchase facility an off balance sheet arrangement  below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the recognition of revenue  including revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  our reserve for loan losses  the valuation of retained interests in notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  golf courses  intangible assets and other assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o revenue recognition 
in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  we recognize revenue on voi and homesite sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
we believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold 
see the further discussion of our policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on our notes receivable  below 
should our estimates regarding the collectibility of our receivables change adversely  we may have to defer the recognition of sales and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
in cases where all development has not been completed  we recognize revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should our estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing of our vacation ownership or bluegreen communities projects increase  we may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to defer revenue for a longer period of time  and thus our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
o allowance for loan losses 
we estimate credit losses on our notes receivable portfolios in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as our notes receivable portfolios consist of a large group of smaller balance  homogeneous loans 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  we first segment our notes receivable by identifying risk characteristics that are common to groups of loans and then estimate credit losses based on the risks associated with these segments 
we consider many factors when establishing and evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for loan losses 
these factors include recent and historical default rates  static pool analyses  current delinquency rates  contractual payment terms  loss severity rates along with present and expected economic conditions 
we review these factors and measure loan impairment by applying historical loss rates  adjusted for relevant environmental and collateral values  to the segments aggregate loan balances 
we adjust our reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
should our estimates of these and other pertinent factors change  our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity position could be adversely affected 
o transfers of financial assets 
when we transfer financial assets to third parties  such as when we sell notes receivable pursuant to our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities  we evaluate whether or not such transfer should be accounted for as a sale pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and related interpretations 
the evaluation of sale treatment under sfas no 
involves legal assessments of the transactions  which include determining whether the transferred assets have been isolated from us ie put presumptively beyond our reach or the reach of our creditors  even in bankruptcy or other receivership  determining whether each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received  and ensuring that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets other than through a cleanup call 
we believe that we have obtained appropriate legal opinions and other guidance deemed necessary to properly account for our transfers of financial assets as sales in accordance with sfas no 
in connection with the sales of notes receivable referred to above  we retain subordinated tranches  rights to excess interest spread and servicing rights  all of which are retained interests in the notes receivable sold 
gain or loss on the sale of the notes receivable depends in part on the allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
we initially and periodically estimate fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions prepayment rates  loss severity rates  default rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
should our estimates of these key assumptions change or should the portfolios sold fail to satisfy specified performance criteria and therefore trigger provisions whereby outside investors in the portfolios are paid on an accelerated basis  there could be a reduction in the fair value of the retained interests and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
during the year ended december   we recognized an other than temporary decrease of approximately  in the fair market value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization  based on higher than anticipated default rates in the portfolio sold 
o asset impairment 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets including our real estate properties under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors that we consider in making this evaluation include the estimated remaining life of project sales for each project based on current retail prices and the estimated costs to complete each project 
should our estimates of these factors change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
o goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been assigned 
as of december   only our bluegreen resorts reporting unit had any recorded goodwill and intangible assets 
should our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
o telemarketing costs 
during the years ended march  and april   we deferred the cost of generating vacation ownership tours through telemarketing programs until such time as these tours were conducted or the related mini vacation package expired  based on an accepted industry accounting principle 
in december  we elected to change our accounting policy to expense such costs as incurred  effective april  we believe that the new method of accounting for these costs is preferable over our previous method and have applied the new method of accounting prospectively 
we believe accounting for these costs as period expenses results in improved financial reporting 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was additional expense of million  net of tax  in the nine months ended december  results of operations we review financial information  allocate resources and manage our business as two segments  bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities 
the information reviewed is based on internal reports and excludes general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead 
the information provided is based on a management approach and is used by us for the purpose of tracking trends and changes in results 
it does not reflect the actual economic costs  contributions or results of operations of the segments as stand alone businesses 
if a different basis of presentation or allocation were utilized  the relative contributions of the segments might differ but the relative trends  in our view  would likely not be materially impacted 
the table below sets forth net revenue and income from operations by segment 
bluegreen bluegreen resorts communities total percentage percentage percentage amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales dollars in thousands year ended march  sales of real estate    cost of real estate sales    gross profit    other resort and communities operations revenues    cost of other resort and communities operations    selling and marketing expenses    field general and administrative expenses    field operating profit    year ended december sales of real estate    cost of real estate sales    gross profit    other resort and communities operations revenues    cost of other resort and communities operations    selling and marketing expenses    field general and administrative expenses    field operating profit    year ended december sales of real estate    cost of real estate sales    gross profit    other resort and communities operations revenues    cost of other resort and communities operations    selling and marketing expenses    field general and administrative expenses    field operating profit    general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead have been excluded from the tables 
corporate general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended march   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  see corporate general and administrative expenses  below  for further discussion 
we have disclosed the results of operations for the year ended december  for purposes of comparability 
december  was the year we transitioned from a march year end to a december year end 
sales and field operations 
consolidated sales were million for the year ended march   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  consolidated sales increased from the year ended march  to the year ended december  and from the year ended december  to the year ended december bluegreen resorts 
during the years ended march   december  and december   sales of vois contributed million  million and million of our total consolidated sales  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain information for sales of vois for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting 
year ended march  december  december  number of voi sale transactions    average sales price per transaction    gross margin the million or increase in bluegreen resorts sales during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was due in part to the opening of six new sales sites mountain run at boyne tm in boyne falls  michigan opened in november  an off site sales office in minneapolis  minnesota opened in november  solara surfside tm in surfside  florida opened january  an off site sales office in harbor springs  michigan opened in march on the campus of the boyne highlands resort  pursuant to a marketing agreement with boyne usa resorts  grande villas at world golf village r opened in november and the fountains tm in orlando  florida opened in december 
these new sales sites generated a combined million of incremental sales during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the remainder of the sales increase was due to same store sales increases primarily as a result of greater focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base and to sales prospects referred to us by existing bluegreen vacation club owners and other prospects 
sales to owner and referral prospects increased by during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this  combined with a overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts from approximately  prospects during the year ended december  to approximately  prospects during the year ended december  and an increase in the sale to tour conversion ratio from to during these periods  respectively  significantly contributed to the overall sales increase during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in the average sales price per transaction reflected in the above table also contributed to the increase in sales 
the million or increase in bluegreen resorts sales during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increased focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base and to sales prospects referred to us by existing bluegreen vacation club owners or other prospects 
sales to owner and referral prospects increased by during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended march  this combined with a overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts from approximately  prospects during the year ended march  to approximately  prospects during the year ended december  and the increase in average sales price reflected in the above table resulted in the increase in sales during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended march  gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period 
other resort operations revenues increased million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   gvd s revenues increased by approximately million as compared to the year ended december   as the period only included approximately three months of gvd s operations 
the remainder of the increase in other resort operations revenues was due to an increase in revenues generated by our wholly owned title company and an increase in revenues from managing the bluegreen vacation club  both of such increases are the result of the increase in voi sales during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  other resort operations revenues increased million or from million to million during the years ended march  and december   respectively 
on october   gvd  our wholly owned subsidiary  acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of tmov 
gvd was a newly formed entity with no prior operations 
utilizing the assets acquired from tmov  gvd generates sales leads for voi sales utilizing various marketing strategies 
through the application of our proprietary computer software system  these leads are then contacted and given the opportunity to purchase mini vacation packages 
these packages sometimes combine hotel stays  cruises and gift premiums 
buyers of these mini vacation packages are then usually required to participate in a voi sales presentation 
gvd generates sales prospects for our voi sales business and sales prospects that will be sold to other voi developers 
from october  through december   gvd generated million of revenues  primarily from mini vacation sales and payments for sales prospects provided to third party voi developers  which are included in other resort service revenues on the consolidated income statement  resulting in the overall increase in other resort service revenues during the year ended december  cost of other resort operations increased million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  operating expenses incurred by gvd increased million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as the period only included approximately three months of gvd s operations 
the remaining increase in cost of other resort operations during the year ended december  was primarily due to start up costs of a new owner services center in indianapolis  indiana and new purchasing and design operations in knoxville  tennessee as well as increased costs of managing the bluegreen vacation club due to the growth in the number of members 
cost of other resort operations increased million or from million to million during the years ended march  and december   respectively 
this increase was primarily the result of operating expenses of million incurred by gvd after its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of tmov in october  selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts decreased as a percentage of sales from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an increase in the sale to tour conversion ratio from to and the increase in the average sales price per transaction noted above 
the decrease is also due to the increase in sales to our bluegreen vacation club owner base and to sales prospects referred to us by existing bluegreen vacation club owners and other prospects  as previously discussed 
sales to these prospects have relatively lower associated marketing costs 
we believe that selling and marketing expense as a percentage of sales is an important indicator of the performance of bluegreen resorts and our performance as a whole 
no assurance can be given that selling and marketing expenses will not increase as a percentage of sales in future periods 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts  which are primarily variable with sales  remained constant as a percentage of sales at during the years ended march  and december  field general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of the minneapolis and harbor springs boyne highlands offsite sales offices  the opening of the mountain run at boyne  solara surfside  grande villas at world golf village r and the fountains on site sales offices and expenses associated with the consideration of potential real estate acquisitions during the year ended december  which were not pursued 
field general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts increased  or from million to million during the years ended march  and december   respectively 
this increase was primarily due to the start up costs associated with the minneapolis offsite sales office and the mountain run at boyne sales office 
bluegreen communities 
during the years ended march   december  and december   bluegreen communities generated million  million and million of our total consolidated sales  respectively 
the table below sets forth the number of homesites sold by bluegreen communities and the average sales price per homesite for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and excluding sales of bulk parcels 
year ended march  december  december  number of homesites sold    average sales price per homesite    gross margin bluegreen communities sales increased million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in march  bluegreen communities acquired  acres in braselton  georgia for the development of a new golf course community known as the traditions of braselton tm 
this new project  which began sales in april  recognized sales of approximately million during the year ended december  in sunset  texas  our silver lakes ranch community commenced sales in and generated million in sales 
these increases in sales were partially offset by the impact of the sellout of two of our north carolina golf communities  the preserve at jordan lake tm in chapel hill and winding river plantation in southport  which resulted in a decrease in sales at these two properties of approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  bluegreen communities sales increased million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended march   due to increased sales at ridge lake shores  a  acre property acquired in february in magnolia  texas  and mountain lakes ranch  a  acre property acquired in october in bluffdale  texas 
ridge lake shores had just opened for sales during the year ended march  and started achieving a post start up sales pace during the year ended december  mountain lakes ranch benefited from a more mature marketing program and continued development 
bluegreen communities intends to primarily focus its resources on developing new golf course communities and continuing to support its successful projects in texas 
in december  we commenced sales at our newest golf course community  sanctuary cove at st 
andrew s sound near st 
simons island in brunswick county  georgia 
in its first month of sales  this project recognized million in sales 
estimated remaining life of project sales for sanctuary cove were approximately million at december  during the year ended december   our golf communities and communities in texas comprised approximately and  respectively  of bluegreen communities sales 
bluegreen community s gross margin remained relatively constant during the years ended march   december  and december  variations in cost structures and the market pricing of projects available for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects which include premium homesites eg  water frontage  preferred views  larger acreage homesites  etc 
will impact the gross margin of bluegreen communities from period to period 
these factors  as well as the impact of percentage of completion accounting  will cause variations in gross margin between periods  although the gross margin has historically been between and of sales and is expected to approximate these percentages for the foreseeable future 
other communities operations revenues increased million or from million to million and the related costs increased million or from million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
these increases were primarily due to the opening of the golf courses at brickshire and the preserve at jordan lake in march and august  respectively 
in addition  our realty resale operations  which commenced operations in january  generated million in commission revenues and incurred million in costs during the year ended december  other communities operations include the operation of our golf courses as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential land communities 
other communities operations revenue increased million or from million to million and the cost of golf operations increased from million to million during the years ended march  and december   respectively 
these increases were primarily due to the opening of the golf courses at brickshire  located in new kent  virginia  and the preserve at jordan lake in march and august  respectively 
our golf course operations yielded aggregate losses of   and million during the years ended march   december  and december  the losses from golf course operations are due to fixed operating expenses  low  seasonal revenues during the winter months and high maintenance costs during periods when we are marketing homesites in the surrounding community 
also  our golf courses were still in their early years of operations during the periods presented 
we believe that the operating results of these new courses should improve as individuals who have purchased homesites in the communities in which these courses are located actually build their homes and begin living in the community  which we believe will increase the amount of play on our golf courses 
however  there is no assurance that such improvement in operating results will be realized 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities increased as a percentage of sales from to during the year ended december  and december   respectively  due to the impact of percentage of completion accounting and due to the substantial sell out of the preserve at jordan lake during the year ended december  while we defer the recognition of sales under the percentage of completion method of accounting  we do not defer the recognition of certain selling and marketing costs associated with the sales deferred 
this increases selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales 
the preserve at jordan lake generated lower selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales due in part to its location near the raleigh durham area  which decreased overall selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales for bluegreen communities during the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities remained relatively constant at approximately of sales during the years ended march  and december  bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses increased million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the fact that the costs associated with new communities that opened for sales were greater than the costs associated with communities which substantially sold out during the year ended december   as more new projects were added than were substantially sold out 
the increase in these costs as a percentage of sales is also due to the impact of percentage of completion accounting  as we do not defer such expenses notwithstanding that the associated revenue is deferred 
bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant during the years ended march  and december  as of december   bluegreen communities had million of sales and million of field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
as of december   bluegreen communities had million of sales and million of field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
corporate general and administrative expenses 
our corporate general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with administering the various support functions at our corporate headquarters  including accounting  human resources  information technology  mergers and acquisitions  mortgage servicing  treasury and legal 
such expenses were million  million and million for the years ended march   december  and december   respectively 
the million or increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increased number of personnel and other expenses incurred in our information technology area to help support our growth 
for a discussion of field selling  general and administrative expenses  please see sales and field operations  above 
interest income 
interest income is earned from our notes receivable  retained interests in notes receivable sold including remic transactions and cash and cash equivalents 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended march   december  and december   respectively 
the increase in interest income during the year ended december  was due to higher interest income earned from our notes receivable commensurate with higher average aggregate notes receivable balances during the period as compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest income during the year ended december  was partially offset by an other than temporary decrease of  in the fair value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization transaction  based on higher than projected default rates in the portfolio sold 
gain on sales of notes receivable 
during the years ended march   december  and december   we recognized gains on the sale of notes receivable totaling million  million and million  respectively 
the sales of vacation ownership notes receivable were primarily pursuant to vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities in place during the respective periods 
the gain on sale of notes receivable during the year ended december   also included a million gain recorded in connection with the december  private offering and sale the term securitization of million in aggregate purchase price of vacation ownership receivables  including receivables previously sold to ing capital  llc ing  general electric capital real estate heller financial  inc ge and barclays bank  plc barclays and receivables previously pledged to ge 
the amount of notes receivable sold during a period depends on several factors  including the amount of availability  if any  under receivables purchase facilities  the amount of eligible receivables available for sale  our cash requirements  the covenants and other provisions of the relevant vacation ownership receivables purchase facility as described further below and management s discretion 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended march   december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the year ended december  was due to higher average outstanding debt balances  primarily related to acquisition and development loans entered into in connection with inventory acquisitions during the effective cost of borrowing was and for the years ended march   december  and december   respectively 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded provisions for loan losses totaling million  million and million during the years ended march   december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan losses during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to higher notes receivable balances outstanding at december  as compared to december  the decrease in the provision during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended march   was due to increased  non recourse sales of notes receivable pursuant to our vacation ownership receivables purchase facility during the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses by division as of december  and december  was bluegreen bluegreen resorts communities other total dollars in thousands december  notes receivable     allowance for loan losses   notes receivable  net     allowance as a of gross notes receivable december  notes receivable     allowance for loan losses   notes receivable  net     allowance as a of gross notes receivable other notes receivable at december  and december   primarily consists of a loan to the property owners association that is responsible for the maintenance of our la cabana beach and racquet club resort  casa grande cooperative association i see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary 
we include the results of operations and financial position of bluegreen big cedar vacations  llc the subsidiary  our owned subsidiary  in our consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary is the portion of our consolidated pre tax income that is earned by big cedar  llc  the unaffiliated interest holder in the subsidiary 
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary was  million and million for the years ended march   december  and december   respectively 
pre tax income for the subsidiary has increased over the periods presented as sales at the big cedar wilderness club have increased 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
during the years ended april  and march   we deferred the costs of generating voi tours through telemarketing programs until the earlier of such time as the tours were conducted or the related mini vacation packages expired  based on an accepted industry accounting principle 
effective april   we elected to change our accounting policy to expense such costs as incurred 
we believe that the new method of accounting for these costs is preferable over our previous method and has been applied prospectively 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was additional expense of million  net of tax 
summary 
based on the factors discussed above  our net income was million  million and million for the years ended march   december  and december   respectively 
changes in financial condition the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended march   december  and december  in thousands year ended march  december  december  cash flows provided by operating activities    cash flows provided used by investing activities    cash flows used by financing activities    net increase in cash    cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities increased million or from net cash inflows of million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
proceeds from the sale of and borrowings collateralized by notes receivable  net of payments on such borrowings  increased million from million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million or from net cash inflows of million to million during the years ended march  and december   respectively 
proceeds from the sale of and borrowings collateralized by notes receivable  net of payments on such borrowings  decreased million from million to million during the years ended march  and december   respectively 
the remainder of the decrease in operating cash flows during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended march  was due to the increase in notes receivable  partially offset by the decrease in inventory  as a result of our increased voi and homesite sales 
we report cash flows from borrowings collateralized by notes receivable and sales of notes receivable as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the majority of bluegreen resorts sales result in the origination of notes receivable from its customers 
we believe that accelerating the conversion of such notes receivable into cash  either through the pledge or sale of our notes receivable  on a regular basis is an integral function of our operations  and have therefore classified such activities as operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities decreased million or from net cash inflows of million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to less cash received from our retained interests in notes receivable sold 
as a result of a term securitization of previously sold notes receivable during the nine months ended december   all cash generated by the securitized receivables that we would normally receive in connection with the retained interests was first used to fund required cash reserve accounts 
we began to receive cash inflows relative to the retained interests in the term securitization during the quarter ended september  we received million and million of cash from our retained interests in notes receivable sold during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the remainder of the decrease in cash flows from investing activities was due to increased purchases of fixed assets 
cash flows from investing activities increased million or from net cash outflows of million to net cash inflows of million for the years ended march  and december   respectively 
the increase was primarily due to more cash received from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  as the amount of these retained interests grew during the year ended december  we received million and million of cash from our retained interests in notes receivable sold during the years ended march  and december   respectively 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities increased million or from net cash outflows of million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
during the year ended december   we repaid upon maturity million of convertible subordinated notes payable to former members of our board of directors 
also  payments under line of credit facilities  net of new borrowings  decreased from million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
cash flows from financing activities remained relatively constant at net cash outflows of million and million during the years ended march  and december   respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our capital resources are provided from both internal and external sources 
our primary capital resources from internal operations are i cash sales  ii downpayments on homesite and voi sales which are financed  iii proceeds from the sale of  or borrowings collateralized by  notes receivable  including cash received from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  iv principal and interest payments on the purchase money mortgage loans and contracts for deed owned arising from sales of vois and homesites and v net cash generated from other resort services and other communities operations 
historically  external sources of liquidity have included non recourse sales of notes receivable  borrowings under secured and unsecured lines of credit  seller and bank financing of inventory acquisitions and the issuance of debt securities 
our capital resources are used to support our operations  including i acquiring and developing inventory  ii providing financing for customer purchases  iii funding operating expenses and iv satisfying our debt and other obligations 
as we are continually selling and marketing real estate vois and homesites  it is necessary for us to continually acquire and develop new resorts and communities in order to maintain adequate levels of inventory to support operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to require external sources of liquidity to support our operations  satisfy our debt and other obligations and to provide funds for future acquisitions 
our level of debt and debt service requirements has several important effects on our operations  including the following i we have significant cash requirements to service debt  reducing funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  ii our leveraged position increases our vulnerability to competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in the indentures  the credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  make investments or pay cash dividends on  or repurchase  preferred or common stock  and iv funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes may be limited 
certain of our competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
we intend to continue to pursue a growth oriented strategy  particularly with respect to our bluegreen resorts business segment 
in connection with this strategy  we may from time to time acquire  among other things  additional resort properties and completed but unsold vois  land upon which additional resorts may be built  management contracts  loan portfolios of vacation ownership mortgages  portfolios which include properties or assets which may be integrated into our operations  interests in joint ventures  and operating companies providing or possessing management  sales  marketing  development  administration and or other expertise with respect to our operations in the vacation ownership industry 
in addition  we intend to continue to focus bluegreen communities on larger  more capital intensive projects particularly in those regions where we believe the market for our products is strongest  such as new golf communities in the southeast and other areas and continued growth in our successful regions in texas 
the following is a discussion of our purchase and credit facilities that were important sources of our liquidity as of december  these facilities do not constitute all of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  our other indebtedness includes outstanding convertible subordinated debentures  senior secured notes payable  borrowings collateralized by real estate inventories that were not incurred pursuant to an ongoing credit facility and capital leases 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our indebtedness as of december  vacation ownership receivables purchase facility an off balance sheet arrangement our ability to sell and or borrow against our notes receivable from voi buyers is a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
when we sell vois  a financed buyer is only required to pay a minimum of of the purchase in cash at the time of sale  however  selling  marketing and administrative expenses are primarily cash expenses and  in our case for the year ended december   approximated of sales 
accordingly  having facilities available for the hypothecation and sale of these vacation ownership receivables is a critical factor to our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
on october   resort finance  llc rfl acquired and assumed the rights  obligations and commitments of ing as initial purchaser in an existing vacation ownership receivables purchase facility the purchase facility originally executed between ing and us in april in connection with its assumption of the purchase facility  rfl expanded and extended the purchase facility s size and term 
the purchase facility utilizes an owner s trust structure  pursuant to which we sell receivables to bluegreen receivables finance corporation v  our wholly owned  special purpose finance subsidiary brfcv  and brfcv sells the receivables to an owners trust a qualified special purpose entity without recourse to us or brfcv except for breaches of certain representations and warranties at the time of sale 
we did not enter into any guarantees in connection with the purchase facility 
the purchase facility has detailed requirements with respect to the eligibility of receivables for purchase  and fundings under the purchase facility are subject to certain conditions precedent 
under the purchase facility  a variable purchase price of of the principal balance of the receivables sold  subject to certain terms and conditions  is paid at closing in cash 
the balance of the purchase price is deferred until such time as rfl has received a specified return and all servicing  custodial  agent and similar fees and expenses have been paid 
rfl earns a return equal to the one month london interbank offered rate libor plus an additional return ranging from to  based on the amount outstanding under the purchase facility  subject to use of alternate return rates in certain circumstances 
in addition  rfl receives a annual program fee 
the purchase facility also provides for the sale of land notes receivable  under modified terms 
we act as servicer under the purchase facility for a fee 
the purchase facility includes various conditions to purchase  covenants  trigger events and other provisions customary for a transaction of this type 
rfl s obligation to purchase under the purchase facility may terminate upon the occurrence of specified events 
these specified events  some of which are subject to materiality qualifiers and cure periods  include  without limitation  i our breach of the representations or warranties in the purchase facility  ii our failure to perform our covenants in the purchase facility  including  without limitation  a failure to pay principal or interest due to rfl  iii our commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding or the like  iv a material adverse change to us since december   v the amount borrowed under the purchase facility exceeding the borrowing base  vi significant delinquencies or defaults on the receivables sold  vii a payment default by us under any other borrowing arrangement of million or more  or an event of default under any indenture  facility or agreement that results in a default under any borrowing arrangement  viii a default or breach under any other agreement beyond the applicable grace period if such default or breach a involves the failure to make a payment in excess of of our tangible net worth or b causes  or permits the holder of indebtedness to cause  an amount in excess of of our tangible net worth to become due  ix our tangible net worth not equaling at least million plus of net income and of the proceeds from new equity financing following the first closing under the purchase facility  x the ratio of our debt to tangible net worth exceeding to  or xi our failure to perform our servicing obligations 
the purchase facility  as increased by amendment  allows for sales of notes receivable for a cumulative purchase price of up to million on a revolving basis through september   at a variable purchase price of of the principal balance  subject to the eligibility requirements and certain conditions precedent 
based on sales of receivables under the purchase facility and cash payments of the principal balance of the receivables sold  the remaining availability under the purchase facility as of december  was million 
in february and march  we sold notes receivable with an aggregate principal balance of million under the purchase facility for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as of march   the remaining availability under the purchase facility was million 
we have chosen to monetize our receivables through the purchase facility and  historically  other similar facilities as these off balance sheet arrangements provide us with cash inflows both currently and in the future at what we believe to be competitive rates without adding leverage to our balance sheet or retaining recourse for losses on the receivables sold 
in addition  these sale transactions have generated gains on our income statement on a quarterly basis  which would not be realized under a traditional financing arrangement 
the purchase facility discussed above is the only receivables purchase facility under which we currently have the ability to sell receivables 
we are currently finalizing terms for a potential new vacation ownership receivables purchase facility with an unaffiliated financial institution  and discussing terms for another such facility with another unaffiliated financial institution 
we cannot provide assurance that either of these potential new facilities will be obtained on favorable terms or at all 
factors which could adversely impact our ability to obtain new or additional vacation ownership receivable purchase facilities include a downturn in general economic conditions  negative trends in the commercial paper or libor markets  increases in interest rates  a decrease in the number of financial institutions willing to enter into facilities with vacation ownership companies  a deterioration in the performance of our vacation ownership notes receivable or in the performance of portfolios sold in prior transactions  specifically increased delinquency  default and loss severity rates  and a deterioration in our performance generally 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain new purchase facilities to replace the purchase facility when it is completed or expires 
as indicated above  our inability to sell vacation ownership receivables under a current or future facility could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
however  management believes that to the extent we could not sell receivables under a purchase facility  we could potentially mitigate the adverse impact on our liquidity by using our receivables as collateral under existing or future credit facilities 
we have also been a party to a number of securitization type transactions  all of which in our opinion utilize customary structures and terms for transactions of this type 
in each securitization type transaction  we sold receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity which  in turn  sold the receivables either directly to third parties or to a trust established for the transaction 
in each transaction  the receivables were sold on a non recourse basis except for breaches of certain representations and warranties and the special purpose entity has a retained interest in the receivables sold 
we have acted as servicer of the receivables pools in each transaction for a fee  with the servicing obligations specified under the applicable transaction documents 
under the terms of the applicable securitization transaction  the cash payments received from obligors on the receivables sold are distributed to the investors which  depending on the transaction  may acquire the receivables directly or purchase an interest in  or make loans secured by the receivables to  a trust that owns the receivables  parties providing services in connection with the facility  and our special purpose subsidiary as the holder of the retained interests in the receivables according to specified formulas 
in general  available funds are applied monthly to pay fees to service providers  interest and principal payments to investors  and distributions in respect of the retained interests in the receivables 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents  however  to the extent the portfolio of receivables fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or other trigger events  the funds received from obligors are distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
in effect  during a period in which the accelerated payment formula is applicable  funds go to outside investors until they receive the full amount owed to them and only then are payments made to our subsidiary in its capacity as the holder of the retained interests 
depending on the circumstances and the transaction  the application of the accelerated payment formula may be permanent or temporary until the trigger event is cured 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow on the retained interests in the receivables would be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
such a reduction in cash flow could cause a decline in the fair value of our retained interests in the receivables sold 
declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to operations in the current period 
in each facility  the failure of the pool of receivables to comply with specified portfolio covenants can create a trigger event  which results in the use of the accelerated payment formula in certain circumstances until the trigger event is cured and in other circumstances permanently and  to the extent there was any remaining commitment to purchase receivables from our special purpose subsidiary  the suspension or termination of that commitment 
in addition  in each securitization facility certain breaches of our obligations as servicer or other events allow the investor to cause the servicing to be transferred to a substitute third party servicer 
in that case  our obligation to service the receivables would terminate and we would cease to receive a servicing fee

on march   we borrowed million pursuant to the revolving credit facility for the purpose of acquiring  acres of land in braselton  georgia in connection with the development of the traditions of braselton golf course community 
the borrowing required principal payments based on agreed upon release prices as homesites were sold and bore interest at the prime lending rate plus  payable monthly 
as a result of better than estimated sales of homesites at the traditions of braselton during  the entire million borrowing was repaid to foothill by december  the interest rate charged on outstanding receivable borrowings under the revolving credit facility  as amended  is the prime lending rate plus when the average monthly outstanding loan balance is greater than or equal to million 
if the average monthly outstanding loan balance is less than million  the interest rate is the greater of or the prime lending rate plus 
all principal and interest payments received on pledged receivables are applied to principal and interest due under the facility 
in september  foothill extended our ability to borrow under the facility through december   and extended the maturity date to december  for borrowings collateralized by receivables 
at december   the outstanding principal balance under this facility was approximately million  million of which related to bluegreen resorts receivables borrowings and million of which related to bluegreen communities receivables borrowings 
on september   certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a million revolving credit facility the gmac communities facility with rfc 
we are the guarantor on the gmac communities facility 
the gmac communities facility is secured by the real property homesites and personal property related thereto at the following bluegreen communities projects  as well as any bluegreen communities projects acquired by us with funds borrowed under the gmac communities facility the secured projects brickshire new kent county  virginia  mountain lakes ranch bluffdale  texas  ridge lake shores magnolia  texas  riverwood forest fulshear  texas  waterstone boerne  texas  catawba falls preserve tm black mountain  north carolina and yellowstone creek ranch pueblo  colorado 
in addition  the gmac communities facility is secured by our carolina national and the preserve at jordan lake golf courses in southport  north carolina and chapel hill  north carolina  respectively 
borrowings under the gmac communities facility can be drawn through september  principal payments are effected through agreed upon release prices paid to rfc as homesites in the secured projects are sold 
the outstanding principal balance of any borrowings under the gmac communities facility must be repaid by september  the interest charged on outstanding borrowings is at the prime lending rate plus and is payable monthly 
the gmac communities facility includes customary conditions to funding  acceleration and event of default provisions and certain financial affirmative and negative covenants 
we use the proceeds from the gmac communities facility to repay outstanding indebtedness on bluegreen communities projects  finance the acquisition and development of bluegreen communities projects and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   million was outstanding under the gmac communities facility 
over the past several years  we have received substantially all of our homesite sales proceeds in cash 
accordingly  in recent years we have reduced the borrowing capacity under credit agreements secured by bluegreen communities receivables 
we attribute the significant volume of cash sales to an increased willingness on the part of banks to extend direct customer homesite financing at attractive interest rates 
no assurances can be given that local banks will continue to provide such customer financing 
historically  we have funded development for road and utility construction  amenities  surveys and engineering fees from internal operations and have financed the acquisition of bluegreen communities properties through seller  bank or financial institution loans 
terms for repayment under these loans typically call for interest to be paid monthly and principal to be repaid through homesite releases 
the release price is usually an amount based on a pre determined percentage typically to of the gross selling price of the homesites in the subdivision 
in addition  the agreements generally call for minimum cumulative annual amortization 
when we provide financing for our customers and therefore the release price is not available in cash at closing to repay the lender  we are required to pay the creditor with cash derived from other operating activities  principally from cash sales or the pledge of receivables originated from earlier property sales 
unsecured credit facility we have a million unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  na amounts borrowed under the line bear interest at libor plus 
interest is due monthly and all outstanding amounts are due on december  we are only allowed to borrow under the line of credit in amounts less than the remaining availability under our current  active vacation ownership receivables purchase facility plus availability under certain receivables warehouse facilities  less any outstanding letters of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants and conditions typical of arrangements of this type 
during the year ended december   we had borrowed and repaid million under this line of credit 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the line 
this line of credit has historically been a source of short term liquidity for us 
commitments our material commitments as of december  included the required payments due on our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable  commitments to complete our vacation ownership and communities projects based on our sales contracts with customers and commitments under noncancelable operating leases 
the following table summarizes the contractual minimum principal payments required on all of our outstanding debt including our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable and our noncancelable operating leases as of december   by period due in thousands payments due by period less contractual obligations than after year years years years total receivable backed notes payable    lines of credit and notes payable    senior secured notes   convertible subordinated debentures     noncancelable operating leases      total contractual obligations      in addition  we have issued a million letter of credit  which is collateralized by a certificate of deposit  in connection with the issuance of a performance bond on a bluegreen communities project 
this letter of credit expires in january we intend to use cash flow from operations  including cash received from the sale of vacation ownership notes receivable  and cash received from new borrowings under existing or future debt facilities in order to satisfy the above principal payments 
while we believe that we will be able to meet all required debt payments when due  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we estimate that the total cash required to complete resort buildings in which sales have occurred and resort amenities and other common costs in projects in which sales have occurred to be approximately million as of december  we estimate that the total cash required to complete our bluegreen communities projects in which sales have occurred to be approximately million as of december  these amounts assume that we are not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made through a sales contract to a customer  however  we anticipate that we will incur such obligations in the future 
we plan to fund these expenditures over the next five years primarily with available capacity on existing or proposed credit facilities and cash generated from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing or generate the cash from operations necessary to complete the foregoing plans or that actual costs will not exceed those estimated 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facility and one or more replacement facilities we will seek to put in place will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
we will be required to renew or replace credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that will expire in the near term 
we will  in the future  also require additional credit facilities or will be required to issue corporate debt or equity securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require and management deems prudent 
there can be no assurance that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are scheduled to expire in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet our cash needs  including  our debt service obligations 
to the extent we are not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under such facilities  our ability to satisfy our obligations would be materially adversely affected 
we have a large number of credit facilities  indentures  and other outstanding debt instruments  and a receivables purchase facility which include customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  limits on the repurchase of securities  payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  transactions with affiliates  covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios  portfolio performance requirements and events of default or termination 
no assurance can be given that we will not be required to seek waivers of such covenants or that such covenants will not limit our ability to raise funds  sell receivables  satisfy or refinance our obligations or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
in addition  our future operating performance and ability to meet our financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which will be beyond our control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars during the year ended december  were less than of consolidated revenues and consolidated assets  respectively 
sales generated and long term debt incurred to date by bluegreen properties  nv  our subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to our operations or net assets 
interest rate risk we sold million  million  and million of fixed rate vacation ownership notes receivable during the year ended march   the nine months ended december  and the year ended december   respectively  under the purchase facility  the term securitization and previous timeshare receivable purchase facilities see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our gain on sale recognized is generally based upon either fixed or variable interest rates at the time of sale including the prevailing weighted average term treasury rate  commercial paper rates or libor rates depending on the purchase facility in effect and many other factors including  but not limited to the weighted average coupon rate and remaining contractual life of the loans sold  and assumptions regarding the constant prepayment rate  loss severity  annual default and discount rates 
we also retain residual interests in pools of fixed and variable rate bluegreen communities notes receivable sold in private placement remic transactions 
we believe that we have used conservative assumptions in valuing the residual interests retained in the vacation ownership and land notes sold through the purchase facility and remic transactions  respectively  and that such assumptions should mitigate the impact of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on these valuations  but there is no assurance that the assumptions will prove to be correct 
as of december   we had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  our notes receivable from voi and homesite customers were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or three month libor interest rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the prevailing prime or libor rates  as applicable  would decrease our after tax earnings by an immaterial amount per year  based on the impact of increased interest expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by the increased interest income on variable rate bluegreen communities notes receivable and cash and cash equivalents 
a similar change in the interest rate would decrease the total fair value of our fixed rate debt  excluding our convertible  subordinated debentures the debentures and our senior secured notes payable the notes  by an immaterial amount 
the fact that the debentures are publicly traded and convertible into our common stock makes it impractical to estimate the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the fair value of the debentures 
in addition  the fact that the notes are publicly traded in the over the counter market makes it impractical to estimate the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the fair value of the notes 
due to the non interest related factors involved in determining the fair value of these publicly traded securities  their fair values have historically demonstrated increased  decreased or at times contrary relationships to changes in interest rates as compared to other types of fixed rate debt securities 
the analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of such a change  we would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
