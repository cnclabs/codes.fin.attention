item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal total product sales decreased by in in comparison to due principally to the termination of a product license effective as of october   as further discussed below 
the effect of the termination of this product license on the current period to period comparison of our performance is now behind us 
going forward as we compare the results for to  we will be looking at the results of our proprietary products 
sales of our proprietary products principally first defense and wipe out dairy wipes increased by in in comparison to we believe that sales of our products are influenced by the price of milk sold by our primary customers 
after declining to price levels not experienced since the s  the price of milk has recently begun to improve 
a common index used in the industry to measure this trend is known as the class iii milk price  which indicates the value of pounds of milk sold into the cheese market 
the average class iii milk price for was per pounds  which represents a increase from the average for this upward trend could have a positive impact on our sales if it continues in the future 
research and development expenses increased by in in comparison to due principally to the expenses incurred in connection with the experimental field trial of mast out that we completed with positive results 
the  in other income earned from the sale of a non core joint venture in the first quarter of 
table of contents enabled us to pay for this study and report a fifth consecutive profitable year in given the potential sales levels for mast out if it is successfully developed  manufactured and approved for sale by the fda  we believe the increased level of research and development spending is warranted 
total revenues for the year ended december  decreased by  to  from  in product sales for the year ended december  decreased by  to  from  in  primarily due to the termination of the license to market the kamar heatmount detector 
we have generally held our product selling prices without increase in consideration of the difficult economic times being experienced by our primary customers  dairy producers 
sales of first defense increased by during the year ended december  in comparison to the same period in sales have benefited from the withdrawal of a competitive product from the market and from a significant increase in the value of calves 
however  this positive effect was  in part  offset by negative pressures relating to a decline in milk prices 
the sales of first defense are normally seasonal with highest sales expected in the first quarter and lower sales expected during the summer months 
sales of wipe out dairy wipes decreased by during the twelve month period ended december  in comparison to the same period in sales of wipe out dairy wipes were first recorded in following the december acquisition of the product 
we believe the drop in sales in was largely due to the drop in milk prices which is forcing many small dairy producers out of business 
wipe out dairy wipes are more often used on small dairies than larger ones 
grant income decreased by  to  in  comprising of total revenues in and of total revenues in most of the grant income supported work on the development of mast out and new approaches to the diagnosis of johne s disease 
royalty income increased by  to  in in  we earned  in revenue from the sale of technology rights 
in  revenue from the sale of technology rights included  earned upon the termination of a license covering certain of the diffgam technology rights   earned under this license before it was cancelled   from an option to the lactoferrin technology and  from a different license to the diffgam technology 
on october   we accepted a payment of  from kamar  inc of steamboat springs  colorado in consideration of the early termination of the license to market the kamar heatmount detector

a moderately lower gross margin percentage is anticipated as new products initially are developed and acquired 
over time  as these products are fully integrated into our manufacturing and selling operations  we expect to be able to improve the gross margin percentage 
this is the case  for example  with wipe out dairy wipes  a product that we acquired in december in  we invested in the necessary facility addition and production equipment required to process the wipe stock and perform the filling operations for this product internally  which has caused an improvement in the gross margin 
we are now investing in the necessary facility modifications and production equipment required to produce nisin internally 
at this stage in our development  management is focusing on growing the absolute dollar value of the gross margin from the products that we continue to sell

however  this positive affect was more than offset by negative pressures relating to a decline in milk prices and a backlog of orders 
milk prices are currently at levels last experienced in the s  resulting in difficult economic pressures for dairy producers 
sales of first defense have been negatively affected by this significant decline in milk prices 
the sales of first defense are normally seasonal with highest sales expected in the winter months 
a sudden increase in sales volume resulted in an unexpected reduction in product inventory levels creating a backlog of orders worth approximately  as of march  the backlog of orders was filled as of june   and then the backlog of orders increased to approximately  as of december  and to  as of september  we completed a facility addition in may to increase our production capacity and eliminated the backlog of orders as of december  distributor order patterns may have been influenced by the backlog of orders in sales of wipe out dairy wipes increased by during the twelve month period ended december  in comparison to the same period in sales of wipe out dairy wipes were first recorded in following the december acquisition of the product

we utilized deferred tax benefits associated with certain net operating loss carryforwards of  and  as of december  and  respectively  that would offset future tax liabilities 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources we had approximately  in available cash and short term investments as of december  we are using some of this cash to fund product development and to invest in the manufacturing of our commercialized products 
we continue to look for new product acquisition opportunities that would have a strategic fit with the products that we currently sell 
to advance the development of mast out toward fda licensure  we would be required to incur significant outside laboratory expenses to fund the required toxicology  safety and efficacy trials 
the necessary level of research and development expenses required to fund this investment may result in net losses for and we believe that we have sufficient cash to fund any such loss resulting from these development expenses 
by adding back our research and development expenses to the income or loss before taxes  we will be able to measure the potential profitability of our operations without the mast out development program 
we believe the significant investment is warranted  given the potential sales of this product that could be achieved if it is successfully developed and approved by the fda with the product claims that we are pursuing 
nisin for wipe out dairy wipes had been produced for us under subcontract since the product s acquisition in december during  we initiated an investment estimated to aggregate approximately  in building modifications and fixed asset acquisitions necessary to bring the production process in house 
as of december   approximately  had been paid to vendors on this project 
we expect to commence production in april the experience gained in producing nisin for wipe out dairy wipes is also helping us prepare for what we need to do to produce cgmp nisin for mast out at a different facility 
the table below summarizes the changes in selected key balance sheet items balance at december  increase cash and short term investments net working capital total assets stockholders equity during  operating activities provided approximately  in cash 
the three largest operating activities that were added back to net income were depreciation and amortization expense of  non cash tax expense of  and an increase in accrued expenses of  as of december   we had  in deferred tax assets available to offset taxable income generated in the future 
investing activities used  in cash  comprised of a  net investment in fixed assets and a net investment of  in short term investments

during the year ended december   gross margin of  from product sales was not sufficient to fund the aggregate of  in research and development expenses net of grant income net r d and selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses 
the resulting deficit was more than funded by the  in other income received from the sale of our interest in a lactoferrin producing joint venture  and as a result  we were able to record our fifth consecutive year of profitability 
in  the  in gross margin almost funded the aggregate of  in net r d and s  g a expenses

since  our strategy has been to focus our research and development efforts on animal health product opportunities  which are generally less expensive to develop than human health products 
in march  we received a two year award aggregating up to  from the maine technology institute  a non profit corporation created by the general assembly of the state of maine 
the award augmented our development of mast out by funding significant portions of the costs related to conducting the clinical trials and developing the proprietary manufacturing process required to obtain fda approval of the product 
the award carries a contingent payback obligation of  at our option  either the amount of the paid award within two years of first commercial sale of a product developed with the funding or a royalty on any sales of a product developed with the funding until the royalty aggregates two times the amount of the paid award 
because of this contingent payback obligation  the funding was recorded as deferred revenue as the cash was received  and no income was recognized to match the development expenses as they were incurred 
there is no payback obligation in the event that a product is not commercialized 
in such case  the deferred revenue would be recognized at the time the product development effort is discontinued 
we received  under this grant in  an additional  in and the final  in our cumulative investment in research and development expenses of  for the fourteen year period ended december  has been supported  in part  by  in grant awards since we have been awarded seven phase i and three phase ii small business innovation research sbir grants from the national institutes of health aggregating  in addition  we have received three awards from the state of maine aggregating  and two phase i sbir grants from the usda aggregating  in addition to the  that supported the development of the company s milk antibody products for humans  approximately  was awarded in support of the mast out development program   was awarded in support of skin sanitizing applications of nisin   was awarded in support of crypto scan and  was awarded in support of new approaches to the diagnosis of johne s disease 
approximately  of this grant income was recognized prior to and approximately  was recognized in not including the  award from the maine technology institute  described above 
we may  on occasion  seek additional research grant support as a means of leveraging the funds that we are able to spend developing new products 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report which are not historical fact are forward looking statements that involve various important assumptions  risks  uncertainties and other factors 
such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  projections about future financial results  estimates of potential market sizes and product sales  and the timing of product development efforts 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors including  but not limited to  the risk factors discussed below 

table of contents risk factors the sale and development of our products is subject to financial  efficacy  regulatory and market risks 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain the regulatory compliance required to continue selling our products or that we will be able to finance the development of new product opportunities or that  if financed  the new products will be found to be efficacious and gain the appropriate regulatory approval 
furthermore  if regulatory approval is obtained  there can be no assurance that the market estimates will prove to be accurate or that market acceptance at a profitable price level can be achieved or that the products can be profitably manufactured 
we are heavily dependent on the successful development of new products for future growth 
we believe that supplies and raw materials for the production of our products are available from more than one vendor or farm 
our policy is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used in our products 
however  there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies 
the dairy industry is facing very difficult economic pressures at present 
many small farmers are being forced out of business 
milk prices recently declined to levels last experienced in the s 
while these conditions have recently begun to improve  the financial insecurity of our primary customer base is a risk to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level 
first defense is sold in the united states subject to a product license approval from the usda first obtained in the potency of serial lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims the reference standard 
due to the unique nature of the first defense label claims  host animal re testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability of stored reference standard 
to date  these analyses have demonstrated strong stability 
however  if  at any time  the usda does not approve the requalification of the reference standard  additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product 
the potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as foot and mouth disease  bovine tuberculosis  brucellosis and bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse present a risk to us and our customers 
a documented case of bse in the us in has led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal especially bovine origin 
for example  the fda intends to amend its animal feed rule to eliminate the exemption allowing mammalian blood and blood products to be fed to other ruminants as a protein source 
these actions  together with actions by the usda  to increase the levels of protection of the human food supply do not currently  and are not anticipated to  effect first defense  which is manufactured from bovine milk and colostrum and is considered a veterinary medicine rather than a feed ingredient 
however  future regulations to minimize risk against the spread of disease could effect the regulatory status of first defense 
the threat of biological terrorism is a risk to both our ability to economically acquire and collect good quality raw material from our contract farms as well as to the economical health of our customers 
any act of widespread bioterrorism against the dairy industry could have a negative impact on our operations 
effects of inflation and interest rates we believe that neither inflation nor interest rates have had a significant effect on our revenues and expenses 
critical accounting policies details regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements is provided in note n to our financial statements 
the financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the 
table of contents preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  intangible and long lived assets  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of the business and understanding our financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
 and sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
royalty income is recorded on the accrual basis based on sales as reported to us by our licensee pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
non refundable grant income is recognized as reimbursable expenses are incurred 
indirect costs which are billed to the government are subject to their review 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred  as are all related patent costs 
we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings that allow customers to earn cash rebates or future rights to free or discounted product 
we record product selling expenses for customer programs and incentive offerings that allow customers to earn promotional merchandise 
we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years 
distributors of first defense have the right to return expired product for a credit on future orders 
as the product has a two year shelf life  we have not experienced significant product returns historically 
inventories include raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are recorded at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on the first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
work in process and finished goods inventories include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we utilized approximately   and  of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result of two consecutive years of profitable results in and and the expectation of continued profitability  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  in fiscal as a result of the release of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards 
the remaining valuation allowance related to the general business credit carryforward of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  has not been released due to the uncertainty of its use before expiration 
this credit expires in the years through for federal and state income tax purposes  we have remaining net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  expiring from to  that are available to offset future taxable income 
accounts receivable are recorded net of a valuation allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively
