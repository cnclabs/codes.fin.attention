item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview checkfree was founded in as an electronic payment processing company and has become a leading provider of financial electronic commerce products and services 
our current business was developed through the expansion of our core electronic payments business and the acquisition of companies operating in similar or complementary businesses 
we operate our business through three independent but inter related divisions electronic commerce  investment services  and software 
through our electronic commerce division  we enable consumers to receive and pay bills 
for the year ended june   we processed approximately million payment transactions and delivered approximately million e bills 
for the quarter ended june   we processed nearly million payment transactions and delivered approximately million e bills 
the number of transactions we process each year continues to grow 
for the year ended june   growth in the number of transactions processed exceeded 
the electronic commerce division accounted for approximately of our annual revenue 
through our investment services division  we provide a range of portfolio management services to financial institutions  including broker dealers  money managers and investment advisors 
as of june   our clients used the checkfree apl sm portfolio accounting system to manage nearly million portfolios  representing more than billion in assets 
the investment services division accounted for approximately of our annual revenue 
through our software division  we deliver software  maintenance  support and professional services to large financial service providers and other companies across a range of industries 
the software division is comprised of three units  each with its own distinct set of software products 
the ach solutions unit provides software and services that are used to process more than two thirds of the nation s nine billion annual automated clearing house ach payments 
the checkfree financial and compliance solutions cfacs unit enables organizations to handle their reconciliation and compliance requirements and provides a financial transactions management solution with straight through processing 
the i solutions unit provides software and services that enable end to end electronic billing and electronic statement creation  delivery and payment 
the software division accounted for approximately of our annual revenue 
executive summary for the year ended june   we earned net income of million 
through continued efforts to improve quality and efficiency throughout the company  we generated million of free cash flow  an increase of million  or over last year 
this free cash flow  combined with cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million as of june   allowed us to call our million of convertible subordinated notes  to acquire heliograph  ltd 
heliograph for a purchase price of approximately million approximately million net of cash received  and to acquire american payment systems  inc aps for a purchase price of approximately million approximately million net of cash received  subject to certain post closing adjustments  in our fiscal year 
in addition  increasingly positive operating results have allowed us to invest heavily in all of our businesses  in order to take full advantage of anticipated growth opportunities 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  exclusive of the net change in settlement accounts  less capital expenditures 
see use of non gaap financial information for further discussion of this measure 
we continue to experience growth in our electronic commerce business 
despite the completion of the previously announced migration of four large banks to in house billing and payment systems early in fiscal  we generated total transaction growth exceeding on a year over year basis 
by the end of fiscal  one of the 
table of contents four banks signed an exclusive  long term agreement to return to checkfree 
in the quarter ended december   we announced amended contract terms with our largest customer  bank of america 
the new contract reset the pricing model  and the bank converted to a transaction based pricing model with volume discounts that are more predictable than in the past 
continued efforts to improve quality and efficiency in our operations  combined with a steadily improving electronic versus paper payment rate and our ability to leverage a significant fixed cost base  have resulted in a lower cost per transaction  offsetting volume based pricing discounts 
additionally  we delivered almost million e bills in the year ended june   compared to about million in the previous year 
we believe that added availability of e bills will make electronic payment offerings even more compelling to consumers 
finally  on june   we acquired aps in an effort to penetrate a part of the electronic billing and payment market in which we have not materially participated previously 
aps provides agent based walk in bill payments to the estimated of us consumers who do not typically rely on bank products and services 
we expect this acquisition to generate about million transactions and more than million in revenue in the upcoming quarter ending september  the results of our aps operations will be reported in the payment services category of our electronic commerce division 
after two years of slow growth due to stock market conditions  our investment services business has begun to see growth in the number of portfolios managed and related revenue 
to take advantage of the emerging separately managed accounts market  we are investing heavily to upgrade our technology infrastructure in this business 
while near term investments will reduce our operating margin in this segment over the next year or two  we expect the investments to result in increased penetration and growth in this evolving market in the longer term 
despite a solid sales pipeline  customers in our software division continue to require an extended evaluation period before purchasing discretionary software applications 
while our acquisition of heliograph brought us a modest maintenance base and has generated several software sales  revenue growth in our software business was limited to on a year over year basis 
with the addition of aps for the last eight days of fiscal  we expect substantial revenue growth in fiscal  as we benefit from a full year of aps transactions 
while we expect the aps business to result in a modest reduction in our gross margin and our operating margin in the early part of fiscal  as we leverage the technical infrastructure of the business  we expect the margins to return to historical levels by the end of fiscal as part of our acquisition of transpoint in september  we entered into separate five year agreements with microsoft corporation microsoft and first data corporation fdc  both of which include monthly minimum revenue guarantees that have increased annually over the term of the agreements 
these contracts will expire in fiscal the following table represents the total annual minimum revenue guarantees throughout the contract period with microsoft and fdc in thousands fiscal year ended june  microsoft fdc total total both of these agreements are currently operating substantially below their minimum levels 
if volumes do not grow significantly from both microsoft and fdc  we expect to see a temporary decline in revenue growth  initially in the second quarter of fiscal however  we believe we can manage investment levels and improve profitability in our electronic billing business in order to maintain our targeted operating margin in the mid to upper level on a full year basis 
additionally  we plan to continue to pursue other opportunities for growth  as our recent electronic billing and payment contract signings and the aps acquisition demonstrate

total revenue s june  change year ended total company revenue growth was driven by growth in our electronic commerce business  growth in our investment services business and growth in our software business 
growth in our electronic commerce business continues to be driven primarily by growth in transactions processed from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  additionally  revenue related to minimum guarantees from microsoft and fdc increased in total by million on a year over year basis 
we have established pricing models that provide volume based discounts to share scale efficiencies with our customers 
as a result of significant transaction growth  our average revenue per transaction has declined by approximately in our transaction based revenue 
historically low interest rates throughout fiscal have also resulted in a dampening of revenue in our interest sensitive products such as account balance transfer abt 
while our june  acquisition of aps provided only about million of revenue in fiscal  we expect that aps will contribute about million electronic transactions and more than million of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents growth in our investment services revenue was driven primarily by growth in the number of portfolios managed  from approximately million as of june   to nearly million as of june  economic conditions throughout our fiscal year ended june  resulted in portfolios managed remaining essentially flat at million for the year 
as the stock market rebound progressed into our fiscal year  the number of portfolios we managed increased by about  per quarter 
in some cases  new portfolios are being added to our apl system at a lower price point  driven by a mix shift as increased volume comes from broker dealers at a lower price  and by price reductions  where we trade off near term revenue growth against long term strategic advantage 
as investors move back into equity investments  we expect growth rates of portfolios and revenue to continue 
growth in our software business was driven primarily by our acquisition of heliograph in the quarter ended december  while our sales pipeline remains solid  customers continue to take longer to evaluate discretionary software purchases than in prior years 
across all segments of our business  for the year ended june   bank of america generated total revenue of million  which exceeds of our total revenue  and remains the only customer that exceeds of our total revenue 
our agreement with bank of america has a year term  includes annual minimum guarantees of million  and provides for tiered pricing which reflects the volume of activity provided by bank of america 
the following tables set forth comparative revenues  by type  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
processing and servicing revenue s june  change year ended we earn processing and servicing revenue in both our electronic commerce and our investment services businesses 
while growth in portfolios managed in our investment services business contributed nicely  our increase in processing and servicing revenue has come primarily from the aforementioned growth in transactions processed in our electronic commerce business 
while expected transaction volume diverted from checkfree to in house solutions by four large bank customers has dampened our growth during the transition  growth in the remainder of our electronic commerce business  including the addition of two large bank customers  has outpaced diverted transactions 
we delivered approximately million e bills in the year ended june   with a price point of approximately per e bill  representing an increase of over the million e bills delivered during the year ended june  our commercial agreements with microsoft and fdc  resulting from our acquisition of transpoint in september  include monthly minimum revenue guarantees consistent with other consumer service providers 
the minimum revenue guarantees from microsoft and fdc increase annually over the five year term of the agreements 
volumes from microsoft and fdc continue to fall substantially below guaranteed levels  but as a result of contractual increases in the minimum revenue guarantee levels  revenue from microsoft and fdc grew by approximately million on a year over year basis 
somewhat offsetting this growth has been a reduction in market demand for our abt products 
finally  contract revisions with bank of america late in the quarter ended december   along with other volume based discounts inherent in our business  further reduced our processing and servicing revenue growth 

table of contents license fee revenue s june  change year ended although the software market showed signs of recovery  potential customers continued to extend their evaluation period on discretionary software spending 
therefore  in spite of a strong sales pipeline and the addition of heliograph in november  we experienced a slight decline in license revenue on a year over year basis 
maintenance fee revenue s june  change year ended maintenance revenue  which represents annually renewable product support for our software customers  is isolated to our software business  and tends to grow with incremental license sales from previous periods 
our maintenance base has grown as a result of recent license sales  customer retention rates exceeding  and moderate price increases across all business units  as well as eight months of revenue from the acquisition of heliograph 
we defer revenue recognition on maintenance billings until cash is collected  which can cause quarter to quarter fluctuations 
we expect minimal growth in maintenance fee revenue without additional license sales growth 
other revenue s june  change year ended other revenue consists mostly of consulting and implementation fees across all three of our businesses 
during our fiscal year ending june   we performed a custom software implementation project that generated a significant amount of consulting revenue that has not recurred in our fiscal year 
the following set of tables provides line by line expense comparisons with their relative percentages of total company revenue for the years ended june  and  respectively 
cost of processing  servicing and support s june  revenue revenue year ended in electronic commerce  our electronic payment rate has increased from as of june   to as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper based payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care claim 
in addition to leveraging a significant fixed cost processing infrastructure  we continue to focus investment on additional efficiency and quality improvements within our customer care processes and our information technology infrastructure to drive cost per transaction improvement 

table of contents research and development s june  revenue revenue year ended including capitalized development costs of million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june   gross expenditures for research and development were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and were million  or of total revenue for the year ended june  we continue to invest heavily in product enhancement and productivity improvement initiatives in all of our business segments  and we added moderate levels of research and development spending with the acquisition of heliograph 
sales and marketing s june  revenue revenue year ended the decrease in sales and marketing costs  as a percentage of revenue  is due primarily to the fact that the predominance of our revenue growth has taken place in our electronic commerce business  which has less associated variable sales commissions 
on an absolute dollar basis  we have incurred less general awareness marketing program expense in fiscal than we had in fiscal however  these expenses have historically fluctuated due to the nature and timing of various programs 
general and administrative s june  revenue revenue year ended the acquisition of heliograph in the quarter ended december  added approximately million of new quarterly general and administrative costs to our cost base 
in the quarter ended march   we accrued approximately million of costs associated with a closed facility in the ann arbor  michigan area 
we expect our general and administrative costs to continue to run between and of revenue 
depreciation and amortization s june  revenue revenue year ended depreciation and amortization expense from operating fixed assets and internally capitalized product costs has decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the remainder of our depreciation and amortization costs represents acquisition related amortization 
the decrease in non acquisition related depreciation and amortization is the result of investments in replacement assets that carry lower costs than the assets they are replacing 
the remaining reduction in depreciation and amortization is the result of lower acquisition related intangible amortization from intangible assets that have fully amortized since last year  and the amortization of lower non goodwill intangible assets balances resulting from impairment charges in the prior year 

table of contents in process research and development s june  revenue revenue year ended in the three month period ended december   we incurred million of in process research and development costs associated with our acquisition of heliograph 
please refer to note in our consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of this charge 
there was no charge for in process research and development associated with our acquisition of aps in june impairment of intangible assets s june  revenue revenue year ended throughout fiscal  there were no triggering events that caused us to evaluate the recovery of our intangible asset balances 
in april  we performed our annual evaluation of intangible asset recoverability and our tests provided no indication of possible impairment 
throughout fiscal  there were no triggering events that caused us to evaluate the recoverability of our intangible asset balances 
in april  we performed our annual evaluation of intangible asset recoverability 
our initial tests indicated a potential impairment of goodwill in our i solutions reporting unit 
our follow up tests included a statement of financial accounting standards sfas recoverability test of our technology assets  which indicated no issues  and a sfas test  which resulted in an impairment of million in one of our non goodwill intangible assets 
the final sfas test resulted in a further impairment of million in our i solutions goodwill balance for a total charge of million 
reorganization charge s june  revenue revenue year ended due primarily to our inability to sublease office space that was abandoned as a result of a prior reorganization  in the quarter ended june   we recorded million of additional reorganization charges to true up our estimates from the actions we initiated in fiscal equity in the loss of joint venture s june  revenue revenue year ended in april  we announced a joint venture with bacs  ltd 
in the united kingdom  designed to create an integrated electronic billing and payment network for billers and banks in the united kingdom 
the equity in the loss of joint venture represents our portion of the loss incurred by the joint venture since its inception 

table of contents net interest s june  revenue revenue year ended interest income interest expense call premium expense unamortized note issuance cost net interest despite an increase in average cash and invested assets on a year over year basis  interest income has declined as a result of lower average yields 
our interest expense decreased significantly on a year over year basis 
we continued to carry our convertible subordinated notes due at a balance of million throughout the year ending june   and through the quarter ended september  we redeemed the notes in full on december  we incurred a cash charge of million for a call premium to redeem the notes prior to their scheduled maturity date  and we incurred a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized note issuance costs 
loss on investments s june  revenue revenue year ended the fair market value of one of our investments in a private imaging company remained below our book value for an extended period of time 
as a result  we judged this to be an other than temporary decline in the market value based on our evaluation of an expected potential recovery of fair value  and  accordingly  in the quarter ended march   we recorded a charge of million to reflect the loss 
the fair market value of our investment in payment data systems  inc formerly billserv  inc  remained below our book value for an extended period of time 
as a result  we judged this to be an other than temporary decline in the market value based on our evaluation of an expected potential recovery of fair value  and  accordingly  in the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of million 
the fair market value of this investment continued to decline subsequent to december   and in the quarter ended march   we recorded an additional charge of million 
income tax expense benefit s june  effective effective rate rate year ended we turned profitable for the year ended june  however  because our pre tax income was relatively low for the year  earned tax credits significantly reduced our effective tax rate 
as our profits increase and exceed our earned credits in fiscal year  we expect our effective tax rate to approximate the federal and state blended statutory rate of 

table of contents cumulative effect of accounting change s june  revenue revenue year ended on july   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas changed the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  as goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
as a result of the transitional impairment test  under sfas  we determined that goodwill associated with our i solutions reporting unit was impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of tax  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  years ended june  and the following table sets forth total company revenue for the years ended june  and  respectively 
total revenue s june  change year ended total company revenue growth was driven by growth in our electronic commerce business  growth in our software business and growth in our investment services business 
growth in our electronic commerce business was driven primarily by growth in total transactions processed from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  additionally  revenue related to minimum guarantees from microsoft and fdc increased in total by million on a year over year basis 
growth in electronic commerce revenue had been dampened somewhat by a decrease in interest rates  which negatively impacted our interest sensitive offerings  such as our abt product  by certain of our larger customers transferring payment volume to in house solutions during fiscal  and by a large customer reaching pricing tier discounts during fiscal due to significant volume growth 
growth in our investment services business was dampened by poor stock market conditions 
portfolios managed remained relatively flat  as investors reducing stock holdings offset new portfolio growth 
pricing in investment services is primarily based on portfolios managed  and as a result  we experienced less than historical revenue growth in this business 
our software business continued to grow despite our customers extending their software evaluation periods 
we experienced relatively strong software license sales in our seasonally high june and december quarters in fiscal  and we were engaged in a significant software services agreement during the year  which combined to provide a boost to software revenue 
across all segments of our business  for the year ended june   bank of america generated total revenue of million  which exceeded of our total revenue  and was the only customer that exceeded of our total revenue 

table of contents the following tables set forth comparative revenues  by type  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
processing and servicing revenue s june  change year ended as previously mentioned  portfolios managed remained fairly flat year over year  and as a result  we saw only modest growth in processing and servicing revenue from our investment services business 
growth came primarily from greater transactions processed within our electronic commerce business 
additionally  we delivered almost million e bills in the year ended june   as compared to approximately million e bills in the previous year 
in conjunction with our acquisition of transpoint in september  we entered into agreements with microsoft and fdc  both of which include monthly minimum revenue guarantees that increase annually over the five year term of the agreements 
volumes from microsoft and fdc continue to fall substantially below guaranteed levels  but as a result of contractual increases in the minimum revenue guarantee levels  revenue from microsoft and fdc grew by million from the year ended june   to the year ended june  reductions in interest yields from fiscal had a dampening effect on our interest sensitive products such as our abt product  which offset further growth in electronic commerce processing and servicing revenue 
furthermore  our largest customer reached cliff based pricing milestones in the quarters ended december   and june   which reduced our revenue per subscriber for that customer by between and  respectively 
three of our larger customers  all of whom were original principals of a consortium known as spectrum  created and began using in house payment warehouses for routing electronic bill payment transactions in fiscal each of these banks began routing payment transactions to metavante 
a fourth bank customer announced intentions to move its electronic payment processing to an in house payment solution as well and started processing its own payments late in fiscal license fee revenue s june  change year ended potential customers continued to extend their evaluation time on discretionary spending for such things as software products  which resulted in slower than normal software license sales during fiscal as the economy began to turn a bit positive in early calendar  we began to see license sales increase 
maintenance fee revenue s june  change year ended a combination of a decrease in new license sales  customer retention rates of at least across all of our software business units  and moderate price increases on a year over year basis  resulted in a moderately increasing maintenance base 
other revenue s june  change year ended other revenue consists of consulting and implementation fees across all three of our business segments 
the primary driver of growth in this area was a consulting services project we were engaged in with a large bank customer within our ach solutions business unit in fiscal 
table of contents the following set of tables provides line by line expense comparisons with their relative percentages of total company revenue for the years ended june  and  respectively 
cost of processing  servicing and support s june  revenue revenue year ended the most significant factor resulting in the decline in processing and servicing costs  in light of growth in processing and servicing revenue  was platform consolidation in our electronic commerce business late in fiscal for most of fiscal  we maintained three redundant payment processing platforms 
through december  we were converting bank of america subscribers from the legacy bank of america processing platform we purchased in october and  through march  we maintained the redundant system to close out remaining customer care inquiries and claims  at which time we retired the redundant processing platform 
through this period  we paid bank of america to run and maintain the platform for us 
once we retired the bank of america system  we were able to close our customer care facility in san francisco on april   and our houston customer care facility in the month ended june  additionally  as we migrated all but a few csps off of our legacy austin processing platform onto genesis by the end of june  we closed our austin office as well 
the combination of platform consolidation and office closings eliminated approximately million of redundant quarterly processing and servicing costs in the electronic commerce business 
additionally  our electronic payment rate improved from approximately for the year ended june   to over for the year ended june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than do paper based payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care claim 
research and development s june  revenue revenue year ended late in fiscal  we announced a company reorganization that resulted in a reduction in workforce that impacted all our areas  including research and development 
the reduction resulted in savings on a year over year basis 
however  we continued to invest significantly in product enhancement and quality improvement programs in all three of our businesses into fiscal sales and marketing s june  revenue revenue year ended during the fiscal year  we introduced new relationship management and account management positions in our investment services business  however  the previously mentioned reorganization  late in fiscal  also impacted sales and marketing expenses  resulting in a year over year reduction of costs 
general and administrative s june  revenue revenue year ended in addition to reduced rental and related overhead expense from facilities closed late in fiscal and improved collection experience resulting in favorable bad debt expenses year over year  we continued to carefully manage our corporate expenses  resulting in expected leverage in our overhead costs 

table of contents depreciation and amortization s june  revenue revenue year ended in the beginning of fiscal  we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  goodwill was no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
instead  goodwill is now subject to at least an annual assessment for possible impairment 
we continue to amortize all other intangible assets  such as acquired technology  strategic agreements  tradenames  and the like  over their respective useful lives 
as a result of the change  amortization from acquisition related intangible assets decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  underlying depreciation and amortization from operating fixed assets and internally developed product costs increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase in non acquisition related depreciation and amortization was the result of continued investment in new product innovations and fixed assets necessary to support the continued growth of the company 
impairment of intangible assets s june  revenue revenue year ended in the quarter ended december   we recorded intangible asset impairment charges totaling million 
this was the combined result of a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill associated with our acquisition of bluegill technologies in april currently known as checkfree i solutions  and of million for the retirement of certain technology assets we acquired from transpoint in september in the quarter ended june   we recorded intangible asset impairment charges totaling approximately million associated with our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  particularly in our i solutions business unit 
upon adoption of sfas in the quarter ended september   we incurred an additional million impairment of intangible assets that is described below in the section titled cumulative effect of accounting change  which is reflected separately in our consolidated statement of operations included in our consolidated financial statements 
upon successful integration of bluegill technologies into the operations of our software business  during fiscal  we established a revenue outlook for fiscal that anticipated continued rapid growth in software license sales 
we experienced a drop in demand for electronic billing software during the quarter ended september   however  we did not believe this would impact our longer term expectations for this product line and  therefore  in our estimation  there was no impairment at that time 
when software sales declined again in the quarter ended december   we reevaluated our long term expectations and viewed this as a triggering event that required evaluation of possible impairment under the guidelines of sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
our tests relative to the total tangible and intangible assets related to the i solutions product line revealed that the assets were in fact impaired 
this resulted in a charge of million to write down the value of goodwill related to the acquisition of bluegill 
as part of the acquisition of transpoint in september  we were contractually required to maintain the transpoint operating technology for up to three years for any customer that wished to remain on the system 
when valuing the transpoint assets  we established an intangible asset for current technology and assigned it a three year life 
by december   we had migrated all of the subscribers  billers and csps to our genesis platform and the last of our international partners gave notice of their intention to cancel their maintenance agreement with us during the december quarter 
additionally  we had recently concluded that components of the transpoint technology were not compatible with current or future planned initiatives 
we viewed these as triggering events that required the evaluation of possible impairment per sfas our overall testing indicated that there was no impairment of the transpoint assets in general  however  we then evaluated sfas requirements related to the retirement of assets and identified two technologies for which we had no future use 
we retired these two technologies  resulting in a charge of million in the quarter ended december  
table of contents throughout fiscal  there were no triggering events that caused us to evaluate the recoverability of our intangible asset balance 
in april  we performed our annual evaluation of intangible asset recoverability 
our initial tests indicated a potential impairment of goodwill in our i solutions reporting unit 
our follow up tests included an sfas recoverability test of our technology assets  which indicated no impairment  and a sfas test  which resulted in an impairment of million in one of our non goodwill intangible assets 
the final sfas test resulted in a further impairment of million in our i solutions goodwill balance for a total charge of million 
reorganization charge s june  revenue revenue year ended in january  we announced plans to close a customer care facility in san francisco  effective april   which resulted in the termination of employees at that facility 
at that time we also announced our intent to eliminate certain of our financial planning products within our investment services division  which also resulted in a small reduction of employees in our raleigh  north carolina office 
on march   we further announced the closing of our houston and austin  texas offices  our ann arbor  michigan office and our singapore office  combined with a net reduction in force totaling employees 
as a result of those actions  we incurred charges totaling million consisting primarily of severance and related employee benefits and lease termination fees 
we accounted for these actions in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
due primarily to our inability to sublease abandoned office space as originally expected  in the quarter ended june   we recorded million of additional reorganization charges to true up our estimates from the actions we initiated in fiscal net interest s june  revenue revenue year ended interest income interest expense net interest an increase in invested balances of cash  short term and long term investments from to was offset by reduced yields from lower interest rates during fiscal  resulting in a drop in interest income 
the increase in interest expense was due primarily to an increase in long term lease obligations during fiscal anchored by the fixed rate on our million of outstanding convertible debt  average interest rates on our debt remained stable for us over these periods 

table of contents loss on investments s june  revenue revenue year ended the fair market value of one of our investments in a private imaging company remained below our book value for an extended period of time 
as a result  we judged this to be an other than temporary decline in the market value based on our evaluation of an expected potential recovery of fair value  and  accordingly  in the quarter ended march   we recorded a charge of million to reflect the loss 
the fair market value of our investment in payment data systems  inc formerly billserv  inc  remained below our book value for an extended period of time 
as a result  we judged this to be an other than temporary decline in the market value based on our evaluation of an expected potential recovery of fair value  and  accordingly  in the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of million 
the fair market value of this investment continued to decline subsequent to december   and in the quarter ended march   we recorded an additional charge of million 
income tax benefit s june  effective effective rate rate year ended our june   pre tax income included the impact of non deductible goodwill amortization expense 
with our adoption of sfas in july  we stopped amortizing goodwill 
our resulting effective tax rate in fiscal became more in line with a blended statutory rate of about  with the exception of federal and state tax credits that have more than offset other non deductible expense

table of contents years ended june  and electronic commerce segment information electronic commerce revenue s june  change year ended revenue growth in electronic commerce is primarily the result of an increase in transactions processed  the addition of two large bank customers  an increase in e bills distributed  and tiered transpoint related revenue minimums  offset by contractual volume based price discounts  four bank customers transferring transaction volume to in house systems  and dampened demand for our abt product offering 
we offer two basic levels of electronic billing and payment services to our customers a full service offering and a payment services offering 
customers that use our full service offering generally outsource their electronic billing and payment process to us 
a full service customer may or may not use a checkfree hosted user interface  but uses a broad array of services  including payment processing  payment warehouse  claims processing  e bill  online proof of payment  various levels of customer care  and other aspects of our service 
also  while a full service customer may have its own payment warehouse  we maintain a customer record and payment history within our payment warehouse to support the full service customer s servicing needs 
customers in the full service category may contract to pay us either on a per subscriber basis  a per transaction basis  or a blend of both 
the distinction between full service and payment services is based solely on the types of service the customer receives  not on our pricing methodology 
customers that utilize our payment services offering receive a limited subset of our electronic billing and payment services  primarily remittance processing 
additionally  within payment services  we provide services to billers for electronic bill delivery  biller direct hosting and payments  as well as other payment services  such as account balance transfer 
a third category of revenue we simply refer to as other electronic commerce includes our health and fitness business and other ancillary revenue sources  such as consumer service provider and biller implementation and consulting services 
the following tables provide a historical trend of revenue  underlying transaction metrics and subscriber metrics  where appropriate  for our electronic commerce business over fiscal and fiscal fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed 
table of contents fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue non cash revenue impact of warrants totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed the primary drivers of the increase in full service revenue from fiscal to fiscal  were growth in full service transactions processed of  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june   a million increase in transpoint revenue minimums on a year over year basis  and the addition of two large bank customers since june  growth from the aforementioned sources has been offset by several factors 
since the quarter ended september   two large customers moved full service transaction volume to in house systems 
both banks completed their moves by the quarter ended september  the combination of these moves  price tier discounts earned by our largest customer  bank of america  during the last months  additional discounts resulting from our previously mentioned contract amendment with bank of america in the quarter ended december   and general tiered pricing declines across our customer base related to increasing transaction volumes  resulted in full service revenue per transaction declines from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june  in the payment services category  the primary driver of the revenue decline on a year over year basis has been the movement of transactions to in house solutions by two large bank customers since the quarter ended september  the first bank completed its move by december   and the second by the quarter ended december  growth in the remaining payment services businesses has surpassed lost volume from these banks as quarterly revenue has returned to prior year levels 
the decline in other electronic commerce revenue is due to the loss of a large health and fitness customer and less implementation revenue 
additionally  we recorded a non cash addition to revenue of million in the quarter ended september  related to a true up of a previously recorded charge for warrants issued to a third party 
electronic commerce operating income s june  change year ended our ratio of electronic payments to total payments has improved from as of june   to as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care inquiry or claim 
due to our continued efforts toward the improvement of quality and efficiency and the leverage we have experienced in our existing fixed cost base  we realized a reduction in our cost per transaction  which has resulted in an increase in operating income 

table of contents investment services segment information investment services revenue s june  change year ended revenue derived from the volume of portfolios managed has begun to improve  after several quarters of relatively flat results 
the total amount of accounts managed has increased from million at june  to almost million at june  as the stock market has improved  we have seen growth in the number of portfolios managed 
we have provided certain incentives for customers to sign multi year contracts and are experiencing a business mix shift to lower priced services  both of which we expect to result in a modest reduction to our revenue per average portfolio managed as we look forward 
investment services operating income s june  change year ended the reduction in operating income is due primarily to added investment in research and development programs to further improve our product offering in the market and efforts to improve our operational quality standards 
software segment information software revenue s june  change year ended with the acquisition of heliograph in november  our efforts in europe with an enterprise reconciliation solution  and new ach software marketed as pep reach designed to take advantage of recent check conversion rules and regulations  we have experienced an increase in software revenue since the year ended june  however  despite solid sales pipelines and an apparent improvement in economic conditions  customers continue to require an extended evaluation period prior to committing to discretionary software purchases 
software operating income s june  change year ended the decrease in operating income on a year over year basis is due primarily to increased costs associated with the heliograph acquisition in november additionally  we accrued approximately million of costs associated with a closed facility we have been unable to sublease in the ann arbor  michigan area 
as we continue to integrate heliograph into our software business and our license sales begin to improve  we expect improvement in operating income 
corporate segment information corporate operating loss s june  change year ended corporate results represent costs for legal  human resources  finance and various other unallocated overhead expenses 
we continue to leverage our infrastructure costs in the face of increasing revenues 

table of contents purchase accounting amortization purchase accounting amortization s june  change year ended purchase accounting amortization represents amortization of intangible assets resulting from our various acquisitions from forward 
the decrease in expense on a year over year basis is the result of intangible assets that have fully amortized since june   and the amortization of lower intangible asset balances resulting from impairment charges in the year ended june  impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets s june  change year ended in the quarter ended june   we recorded charges totaling million for the impairment of intangible assets 
our annual review for possible impairment of goodwill as required by sfas resulted in a charge of million for the impairment of our customer base intangible asset and another million for the impairment of goodwill  both from intangible assets we established upon the acquisition of bluegill technologies in april currently referred to as checkfree i solutions 
reorganization charge reorganization charge s june  change year ended in the year ended june   we incurred a true up reorganization charge of million  due primarily to our inability to sub lease vacated property that was abandoned in a restructuring action that took place in the year ended june  because these activities were initiated prior to june   we accounted for these actions in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
warrants issued to a third party warrants issued to a third party s june  change year ended during the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against revenue resulting from the probable vesting of warrants issued to a third party 
in the quarter ended september   the warrants vested 
on the date of vesting  however  the fair value of our stock was lower than at june   when we calculated the initial charge 
as a result  a true up of the value of the warrants resulted in a credit to revenue of million in the quarter ended september  the charge  and the true up credit  were based on a black scholes valuation of the warrants and were accounted for as a net charge to revenue in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 

table of contents years ended june  and electronic commerce segment information electronic commerce revenue s june  change year ended in the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against electronic commerce revenue associated with the probable vesting of warrants we issued to a third party 
the warrants vested in the quarter ended september   and at that time  we recorded a true up of million which reduced the original charge 
net of this one time charge and its subsequent true up  revenue in electronic commerce increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase in revenue is driven primarily by an increase in year over year transaction volume 
the following tables provide a historical trend of revenue  underlying transaction metrics  and subscriber metrics where appropriate  for the electronic commerce business fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue non cash revenue impact of warrants totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed 
table of contents fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue non cash revenue impact of warrants totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed we experienced generally steady growth in full service revenue  active subscribers  and transactions processed until the september   quarter when one of our larger customers converted from full service to payment services  and  accordingly  approximately  active subscribers and their related transactions switched categories 
although payment services transactions generate less revenue per transaction  because we provide less service  our cost per transaction is less as well 
although our largest bank customer accounted for more than one third of our active full service subscribers  growth in active subscribers and transactions processed was the result of broad growth throughout the channel 
csp customer pricing in this category can be based on transactions processed  the number of subscribers  or a combination of both 
additionally  in order to share the benefits associated with scale efficiencies  pricing is tiered in nature  whereby a customer exceeding predetermined volumes is eligible for a lower price on a going forward basis 
in addition  the mix of customers utilizing transaction based versus subscriber based pricing will have an impact on revenue per transaction 
in the latter half of the quarter ended december   and again in the early part of the quarter ended june   our largest customer reached pricing tier discount levels 
because of the significance of this relationship  when this customer reaches a pricing tier discount  the implied revenue per transaction in this category declines accordingly 
also  we saw reductions in subscribers and or transactions from two full service customers moving to in house solutions throughout the second half of fiscal we experienced moderate quarterly growth in revenue and transactions processed in the payment services category throughout fiscal  a significant increase in the quarter ended september   followed by a declining revenue trend beginning in the quarter ended december  as previously mentioned  a large bank customer converted from a full service relationship to a payment services relationship and subsequently reduced volumes to us 
this customer is e bill enabled and its in house system is integrated with our processing system 
electronic bills that we present to its customers are routed back to us for payment purposes 
we delivered approximately million e bills in the year ended june   almost three times the approximately million e bills delivered in the year ended june  we also report miscellaneous payment only transactions from complementary products such as our abt business in this category 
other electronic commerce revenue includes our health and fitness product  which grew modestly  and other non transaction related services such as implementation and consulting  which increased on a year over year basis 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against electronic commerce revenue associated with the probable vesting of warrants we issued to a third party 
in the quarter ended september   the warrants actually vested 
on the date of vesting  however  the fair value of our stock was lower than when we calculated the initial charge 
as a result  a true up of the value of the warrants resulted in a credit to revenue of million in the quarter ended september  
table of contents electronic commerce operating income s june  change year ended our ratio of electronic payments to total payments continued to improve  from approximately as of june   to over as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care inquiry or claim 
the full underlying impact of improved efficiency and quality  however  is not fully explained by a change in electronic rate 
throughout fiscal  we supported two additional payment processing platforms over and above our genesis platform 
we paid bank of america to run the legacy bank of america platform through march  as we migrated consumers onto our more efficient genesis platform  and cleared outstanding customer care claims initiated on the bank of america platform 
in march  we announced a corporate wide reorganization that resulted in a reduction in workforce  over and above the employees impacted by office closings and platform consolidation 
in total  we eliminated between million and million of quarterly costs starting in the quarter ended june  finally  we continued to emphasize quality improvement  designed to result in further reduction in cost per transaction as we leverage the fixed costs already invested in our electronic commerce business 
investment services segment information investment services revenue s june  change year ended our total number of portfolios managed had remained relatively flat at approximately million on a year over year basis 
revenue growth in fiscal did not match historical performance as the depressed stock market had a direct impact on our ability to grow revenue in the business 
our pricing is based primarily on portfolios managed and portfolio additions continue to be offset by investors reducing stock holdings 
investment services operating income s june  change year ended the decline in operating income is due to investment spending on new product offerings and quality improvement initiatives in anticipation of a positive turn in the stock market 
throughout fiscal  key initiatives in our investment services business included new product offerings eg  multiple strategy portfolios m pact with a shortened time to market  additional web based products with increased functionality and ease of use  build out of relationship based service offerings in our operations  and investments to improve quality 
software segment information software revenue s june  change year ended the downturn in the software market throughout fiscal and caused many businesses to curtail discretionary expenditures  which resulted in an overall dampening of demand for licensed software solutions 
while our i solutions electronic statement and billing software was impacted most  short term demand for reconciliation and ach processing licenses was impacted as well 
however  during the quarter ended december   we began work on a consulting services agreement with a large bank customer in our ach business unit that provided greater than normal consulting revenue through the end of fiscal resulting services revenue was the driving factor behind growth in the software segment 

table of contents software operating income s june  change year ended in march  we announced a company wide reorganization that resulted in a net reduction in staff 
as part of these actions  we announced the closing of our ann arbor  michigan office 
in addition to the recurring savings that resulted from these actions  improvements in operating income are also the result of continued efforts to closely manage discretionary expenses in light of economic conditions 
corporate segment information corporate operating loss s june  change year ended our corporate segment represents expenses for legal  human resources  finance and other various unallocated overhead expenses

in march  we further announced the closing of our houston  austin  ann arbor and singapore offices  along with a net reduction in force totaling approximately employees 
as a result of these actions  we incurred a charge of million in the quarter ended march   a true up charge of million in the quarter ended june   and a second true up charge of million in the quarter ended june  the first true up consisted primarily of severance and related employee benefits and lease termination fees

after the reclassification noted above  goodwill was no longer amortized 
we performed a transitional impairment test as of july  this impairment test requires us to identify its reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of any reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of any goodwill impairment will be determined through a fair value analysis of each of the assigned assets excluding goodwill and liabilities

application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain

accounting for goodwill 
over the past several years  we have acquired a number of businesses and the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america  which resulted in significant goodwill balances 
as of june   the balance of goodwill on our balance sheet totaled million and is spread across our three business segments as follows electronic commerce of million  software of million  and investment services of million 
upon adoption of sfas  we were required to perform a transitional impairment test related to our goodwill balances 
we performed the test as of july  during the quarter ended september   we recorded a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million related to the i solutions reporting unit of the software segment 
subsequent to the initial adoption of sfas  annual impairment tests were performed in and the annual impairment test in resulted an additional impairment of million related to the i solutions reporting unit of the software segment 
our annual impairment analysis resulted in our electronic commerce  investment services  ach cfacs and i solutions reporting units passing the impairment test  and as a result  no additional testing was required 
however  a decline in the expected cash flows or the estimated terminal value in the future could lead to additional goodwill impairment losses 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate weighted average cost of capital could also result in additional goodwill impairment 

table of contents intangible assets exclusive of goodwill 
over the past several years  we have acquired a number of businesses and the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america  which resulted in significant non goodwill related intangible assets 
as of june   the balance of such intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled million and is spread across our three business segments as follows electronic commerce of million  software of million  and investment services of million 
we adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on july   which replaced sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of among other authoritative standards 
during the year ended june   there were no events that provided a reason to believe any of our non goodwill related intangible assets were impaired 
likewise  our annual test for the impairment of goodwill provided no indication of impairment 
during the year ended june   there were no events that provided a reason to believe any of our non goodwill related intangible assets were impaired 
however  our annual test for the impairment of goodwill caused us to perform additional procedures to test the recoverability of intangible assets within our i solutions reporting unit 
we first tested for the recoverability of our capitalized software 
using the guidance of sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we compared the undiscounted net realizable value for projected i solutions sales for the period representing the remaining useful life of the capitalized software intangible asset 
because the undiscounted net realizable value exceeded the carrying value of the asset  no impairment was indicated 
we then tested for impairment of all intangible assets other than goodwill and capitalized software under the terms of sfas the undiscounted cash flows from our i solutions projections were lower than the carrying value of our intangible assets and  as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down to fair value our customer base asset  which was the only remaining intangible asset 
a swing in our cash flow projections  either up or down  would not have materially impacted the amount of the charge that we recorded 
through june   we evaluated our intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment existed 
sfas required that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
in our software segment  we reviewed our i solutions intangible assets for impairment during the quarter ended december   due to a trend in lower than expected license sales during the extended recessionary economy 
we determined that the book value of intangible assets within i solutions exceeded the undiscounted sum of the expected future cash flows from the assets related to the i solutions business unit  which indicated that the intangible assets were impaired 
the actual amount of impairment was then determined by subtracting the fair value of the expected cash flows from the i solutions business unit from the related long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million against the balance of i solutions goodwill in the quarter ended december  we applied judgment in developing projections of future cash flows from our i solutions business 
our projections included  but were not limited to  expectations of product sales and related future product maintenance revenues  cost of sales  and other operating expenses supporting this business five years into the future 
additionally  we estimated a terminal value  which represented the present value of future cash flow beyond the five year period 
finally  we assumed a discount rate that we believed fairly represented the risk free rate and a risk premium appropriate for this business 
variances from our projected cash flows  and the related terminal value  could have had a significant impact on the amount of the impairment charge we recorded 
if we had assumed a increase in our estimated annual cash flows from the i solutions business unit  we would have passed the sfas undiscounted cash flow test and not recorded an impairment charge at all 
if  however  we reduced our estimated annual cash flows for the i solutions business unit by  our impairment charge would have increased by approximately million 

table of contents in our electronic commerce segment  we reviewed our transpoint related technology assets for impairment during the quarter ended december   due to the termination of a maintenance agreement for this technology from the last of our international partners and an evaluation of the service potential of the related technology assets against our current and future initiatives 
we determined that there was no alternative future use for two of the technology assets  and recorded a charge of million to retire these assets 
the retirement of the transpoint technology assets was an indicator of potential impairment for other intangible assets associated with this acquisition 
sfas required us to test for impairment at the lowest level of separately identifiable cash flows  which we determined in this case  was our electronic commerce division 
because the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the long lived assets book value  there was no impairment 
there were several areas of management judgment used in performing this analysis 
initially  our projections of future cash flow from the electronic commerce division required management s judgment regarding our expectations of future revenues  costs  and other operating expenses supporting this business five years into the future 
additionally  we estimated a terminal value  which represented the present value of future cash flow beyond the five year period 
finally  we assumed a discount rate that we believed fairly represented the risk free rate and a risk premium appropriate for this business 
variances  both positive and negative  from our projected cash flows  and the related terminal value  would not have had a significant impact on our analysis 
if we had assumed a increase in our estimated annual cash flows from the electronic commerce division  we would have simply passed the sfas undiscounted cash flow test by a greater margin 
if we had assumed a reduction in our estimated annual cash flows we still would have passed the undiscounted cash flow test  and therefore  not incurred an impairment charge 
equity instruments issued to customers 
within our electronic commerce segment  from time to time  we have determined it appropriate to issue warrants to certain of our customers to provide an incentive for them to achieve mutually beneficial long term objectives 
these objectives can take the form of performance against long term growth targets  such as the number of the third party s customers that become active bill paying subscribers of our service or the number of bills distributed electronically to the third party s customers  or more relationship oriented  such as simply remaining a customer at a specified future date 
accounting standards for these types of warrants require us to record a charge when it becomes probable that the warrants will vest 
for milestone based warrants the amount of the charge would be the fair value of the portion of the warrants earned by the customer based on their progress towards achieving the milestone s required to vest in the warrants 
at each reporting date  we would determine the current fair value of the portion of the warrants previously earned and true up the charges previously recorded 
in addition  we would record a charge for the fair value of the additional portion of the warrants earned during that period  again based on the customer s progress towards the vesting milestones 
this would continue until the warrants vest  at which time a final fair value is determined and the charge is adjusted accordingly 
at the time we issued these warrants  accounting standards in place indicated that the charge for these type warrants be recorded as an expense 
since then  eitf  accounting for consideration by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  became effective 
this guidance became effective for financial statements issued after december   and is retroactively applied to existing equity instruments previously issued 
it requires that the charge for the fair value of these types of warrants be recorded against revenue up to the cumulative amount of revenue recognized for a customer instead of to expense as was previously the case 
management must use judgment in determining when the vesting of a warrant becomes probable 
as of june   we had million unvested warrants outstanding that could potentially result in significant charges against our revenue  which expire in october deferred income taxes 
as of june   we have million of net deferred income tax assets recorded on our balance sheet  million of which are recorded in the current asset section of our balance sheet  and million of which are netted against long term deferred tax liabilities 
deferred income tax assets represent future tax benefits we expect to be able to apply against future taxable income  and consist primarily of tax credits and net operating loss benefits carried forward to future periods 
our ability to utilize the deferred tax benefits is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance against any deferred income tax benefits that we believe may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to use them 
if we were to record a deferred tax benefit valuation allowance  it would have the effect of increasing our tax expense thereby decreasing our net income and decreasing our deferred tax asset balance on our balance sheet 
we use current estimates of future taxable income to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
projecting our future taxable income requires us to use significant judgment regarding the expected future revenues and expenses in each of our business segments 
in addition  we must assume that changes in tax laws will not materially impact the expected tax liability associated with our expected taxable 
table of contents income 
in fiscal we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our foreign tax credits would not be utilized in the future 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance in the amount of million to reduce our net tax credit carryforwards to their estimated net realizable value 
while our current projections indicate we will be able to fully utilize our remaining deferred income tax benefits  should the economic recession continue for an extended period of time  or competitive pressures or other business risks result in a significant variance to our projected taxable income  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance for our remaining deferred tax asset balances 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation have not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
recent developments in preparing this annual report on form k  we determined that certain deferred tax assets which are expected to be utilized during fiscal were not included in current assets in the balance sheet included in our press release furnished on form k dated august  we have appropriately classified all tax credits and carryforwards we expect to utilize in fiscal as current assets in this annual report on form k 
on august   we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility that provides for up to million in revolving credit loans  including swingline loans and the issuance of letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility matures in three years and borrowings are subject to periodic payments and bear interest at one of two rates  at our option  either prime plus to or libor plus to

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk with the acquisition of bluegill in april  we obtained operations in canada  and with the acquisition of heliograph in november  we now maintain multiple offices in the united kingdom 
as a result  we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize pounds sterling as the functional currency for the united kingdom  and the canadian dollar as the functional currency for canada 
due to the relatively immaterial nature of the amounts involved  our economic exposure from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is not significant at this time 
therefore  we have not yet engaged in forward foreign exchange hedges and other similar instruments to mitigate this immaterial risk 
while our international sales represented approximately two percent of our revenue for the year ended june   we market  sell and license our products throughout the world 
as a result  our future revenue could be somewhat affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products 
our exposure to interest rate risk includes the yield we earn on invested cash  cash equivalents and investments and interest based revenue earned on products such as our abt product 
our outstanding lease obligations carry fixed interest rates 
as part of processing certain types of transactions  we earn interest from the time money is collected from our customers until the time payment is made to merchants 
these revenues  which are generated from trust account balances not included in our consolidated balance sheet  are included in processing and servicing revenue 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage the variability of cash flows related to this interest rate sensitive portion of processing and servicing revenue 
accordingly  we enter into interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our interest rate sensitive revenue 
as of june   we entered into interest rate swap transactions totaling million 
the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges  and they are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the interest rate swaps and underlying interest rate sensitive revenue  fluctuations in the fair value of the swaps are generally offset by the changes resulting from the variability of cash flows from the underlying interest rate sensitive revenue 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of derivatives by about million 
such decline in the fair value of the swap would decrease the cash flows of the underlying hedged interest rate sensitive revenue by basis points 
our investment policy does not allow us to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we maintain a system of internal controls that includes policies and procedures covering the authorization  reporting and monitoring of derivative activity 
further  the policy allows us to enter into derivative contracts only with counter parties that meet certain credit rating and or financial stability criteria 
the counter parties to these contracts are major financial institutions  and we believe the risk of loss is remote
