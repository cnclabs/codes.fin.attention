item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of in february  we outlined our planned business strategy in response to the events that significantly impacted the energy sector and our company during late and  including the collapse of enron and the severe decline of the telecommunications industry 
the plan focused upon migrating to an integrated natural gas business comprised of a strong  but smaller  portfolio of natural gas businesses  reducing debt and increasing our liquidity through asset sales  strategic levels of financing and reductions in operating costs 
the plan provided us with a clear strategy to address near term and medium term debt and liquidity issues  to de leverage the company with the objective of returning to investment grade status and to develop a balance sheet capable of supporting and ultimately growing our remaining businesses 
a component of our plan was to reduce the risk and liquidity requirements of the power segment while realizing the value of power s portfolio 
company restructuring during  we successfully executed the following critical components of our restructuring plan generated cash proceeds of approximately billion from the sale of assets  sustained core business earnings capacity through completed system expansions at gas pipeline  continued drilling activity at exploration production and continued investment in deepwater activities within midstream  repaid billion of debt through scheduled maturities and early extinguishment of debt and accessed the public debt markets available to us primarily to refinance billion of higher cost debt  and continued rationalization of our cost structure  including a percent reduction in selling  general and administrative sg a costs from continuing operations and a percent reduction in general corporate expenses 
addressing liquidity through these efforts  we satisfied key liquidity issues facing us in the form of scheduled debt maturities 
these were primarily the williams production rmt company rmt note payable rmt note of approximately billion including certain contractual fees and deferred interest due on july   and billion of senior unsecured percent notes due march  as a result of the proceeds generated from asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of million of long term debt  we prepaid the rmt note in may during the fourth quarter  we completed tender offers that prepaid approximately million of the senior unsecured percent notes and approximately million of other notes and debentures 
with approximately billion available cash on hand at the end of  we have the capacity to pay the million balance of the senior unsecured percent notes upon their maturity 
during  we expect to maintain cash liquidity levels of at least billion in excess of our immediate needs 
while improved during  we have limited access to the capital markets and must maintain liquidity at a level to manage our operations and meet unforeseen or extraordinary calls on cash 
additionally  we will pursue establishing new revolving and letter of credit facilities to reduce cash requirements associated with our current facility 
exiting the power business we are pursuing a strategy of exiting the power business 
however  market conditions have contributed to the difficulty of  and could delay  a full  immediate exit from this business 
in  we generated in excess of million from the sale  termination or liquidation of power contracts and assets 
during the year  we continued to manage our portfolio to reduce risk  to generate cash and to fulfill contractual commitments 
we are also pursuing our goal to resolve the remaining legal and regulatory issues associated with the business 

table of contents during  we engaged financial advisors to assist and advise with this effort 
because market conditions may change  and we cannot determine the impact of this on a buyer s point of view  amounts ultimately received in any portfolio sale  contract liquidation or realization may be significantly different from the estimated economic value or carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  our tolling agreements are not derivatives and thus have no carrying value in the consolidated balance sheet pursuant to the application of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf 
based on current market conditions  certain of these agreements are forecasted to realize significant future losses 
it is possible that we may sell contracts for less than their carrying value or enter into agreements to terminate certain obligations  either of which could result in significant future loss recognition or reductions of future cash flows 
on a consolidated basis  the net book value at december  of power s portfolio and other long lived assets were in excess of million  while other net assets of power  including net working capital  were in excess of million 
outlook for entering  our plan is focused upon the following objectives sustain solid core business performance  including increased capital allocated to exploration production 
we expect cash flow from operations to be sufficient to meet our capital spending plan of to million and to generate additional cash to be available for debt reduction 
continue reduction of debt and selective refinancing of certain instruments 
we expect to aggressively reduce debt in we have approximately billion in scheduled maturities coming due throughout the year and anticipate using available cash flow  proceeds from assets sales and the release of collateral from credit facilities to further reduce debt levels 
maintain investment discipline 
we have implemented the economic value added eva financial management system as a financial framework for use in evaluating our business decisions and as a major component for determining incentive compensation 
we will invest selectively in those projects that are projected to add value to the company through eva improvement 
key execution steps will include the completion of planned asset sales  which are estimated to generate proceeds of approximately million in  additional reduction of sg a costs  replacing our cash collateralized letter of credit and revolver facility with facilities that do not encumber cash and continued efforts to exit the power business 
some factors that present obstacles that could prevent us from achieving these objectives include volatility of commodity prices  ongoing shareholder and power related litigation  lower than expected cash flow from continuing operations  general economic and industry downturn  and unfavorable capital market conditions 
we continue to address these risks through utilization of commodity hedging strategies  focused efforts to resolve and or respond to litigation claims  managing our business with an emphasis upon generating cash and retaining and developing those business operations serving key economic and energy needs 

table of contents critical accounting policies estimates our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the selection of these has been discussed with our audit committee 
we believe that the following are the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition derivatives we hold a substantial portfolio of derivative contracts for a variety of purposes 
many of these are designated in hedge positions  hence  changes in their fair value are not reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item impacts earnings 
others have not been designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the net change in fair value of these contracts represents unrealized gains and losses and is recognized in income currently marked to market 
the fair value for each of these derivative contracts is determined based on the nature of the transaction and the market in which transactions are executed 
we also incorporate assumptions and judgments about counterparty performance and credit considerations in our determination of fair value 
certain contracts are executed in exchange traded or over the counter markets where quoted prices in active markets may exist 
transactions are also executed in exchange traded or over the counter markets for which market prices may exist  but which may be relatively inactive with limited price transparency 
hence  the ability to determine the fair value of the contract is more subjective than if an independent third party quote were available 
a limited number of transactions are also executed for which quoted market prices are not available 
determining fair value for these contracts involves assumptions and judgments when estimating prices at which market participants would transact if a market existed for the contract or transaction 
we estimate the fair value of these various derivative contracts by incorporating information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets  quoted prices in less active markets  and other market fundamental analysis 
the estimated fair value of all these derivative contracts is continually subject to change as the underlying energy commodity market changes and as management s assumptions and judgments change 
additional discussion of the accounting for energy contracts at fair value is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  energy trading activities  and item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
valuation of deferred tax assets and tax contingencies we have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis and from tax carry forwards generated in the current and prior years 
we must evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that may not be realizable 
this evaluation considers tax planning strategies  including assumptions about the availability and character of future taxable income 
at december   we have million of deferred tax assets for which a million valuation allowance has been established 
when assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered forecasts of future company performance  the estimated impact of potential asset dispositions and our ability and intent to execute tax planning strategies to utilize tax carryovers 
based on our projections  we believe that it is probable that we can utilize our year end federal tax carryovers prior to their expiration 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the tax carryovers 
the ultimate realized amount of deferred tax assets could be materially different from those recorded  as influenced by potential changes in jurisdictional income tax laws and the circumstances surrounding the actual realization of these assets 
we frequently face challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the liability associated with our various filing positions  we record a liability for probable tax contingencies 
the ultimate disposition of these contingencies could have a material impact on net cash flows 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been 
table of contents established or required to pay amounts in excess of our accrued liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
impairment of long lived assets and investments we evaluate our long lived assets and investments for impairment when we believe events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of certain long lived assets or the decline in carrying value of an investment is other than temporary 
in addition to those long lived assets and investments for which impairment charges were recorded see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements  many others were reviewed for which no impairment was required 
our computations utilized judgments and assumptions in the following areas the probability that we would sell an asset or continue to hold and use it  undiscounted future cash flows if an asset is held for use  estimated fair value of the asset  estimated sales proceeds if an asset is sold  form and timing of the asset disposition  and counterparty performance considerations under contracted sales transactions 
our alaska refining  retail and pipeline operations are classified as held for sale at december  they are currently under contract to be sold as a single disposal group 
this sale is expected to close during the first quarter of these assets were written down to fair value less cost to sell during based on the assumption that they would be sold as one disposal group 
if events were to occur that caused us to divide this disposal group or to separately evaluate the individual assets within the disposal group for impairment  certain assets within that group could require an additional impairment 
we have entered into a structured sales transaction for our investment in a foreign telecommunications company 
in our review of this investment for potential impairment  we assumed that the counterparty would perform under the agreement 
if the counterparty is unable to fully perform  an impairment of up to million could be necessary 
we own an equity investment in longhorn partners pipeline lp  a petroleum products pipeline still under development 
during  we recognized an impairment of a portion of our investment based on the terms of a recapitalization plan that closed in february we estimated the fair value of our remaining equity investment based on discounted future cash flows from the project 
because the pipeline is not yet operational  this estimate involved significant judgment  including expected in service date  duration of operational ramp up  ultimate annual volume throughput  ability to obtain external debt financing in the future  risk weighted discount rate  and cash flow projections 
a decrease of percent in our estimate of fair value of this investment would result in an additional impairment of approximately million 
we own a percent equity interest in aux sable liquid products lp  a natural gas liquids extraction and fractionation facility 
during  we performed an impairment review of our investment in aux sable as current operating results and cash flow projections suggested that a decline in the fair value of this investment below our carrying value could exist 
we estimated the fair value of our investment based on a projection of discounted cash flows of aux sable 
based upon our analysis we concluded that the estimated fair value of our 
table of contents investment was below the carrying value with little likelihood that the value would recover above our carrying value over the near term 
as a result  during we recorded a million impairment of this investment to its estimated fair value 
our projections are highly sensitive to changes in volumes and commodity pricing projections 
an additional percent decline in the projected fair value of this investment could result in an additional million charge against our operating results if that decline was determined to be other than temporary 
our gulf liquids new river project llc gulf liquids operations are classified as held for sale at december  these assets were written down to fair value less costs to sell during we estimated fair value based on probability weighted analysis that considered sales price negotiations  salvage value estimates  and discounted future cash flows 
this estimate involved significant judgment  including commodity pricing  probability weighting of the different scenarios  and range of estimated sales proceeds  salvage value and future cash flows 
the estimated cash flows from the various scenarios ranged approximately million above and below our estimated fair value 
we evaluated certain asset groups not yet held for sale for impairment because of the possibility that we could dispose of these assets pursuant to our strategy to sell additional assets in our current estimates of the recoverability of these assets indicate that no impairment is necessary 
a significant assumption in the evaluation of one asset group in this analysis is the probability associated with selling the asset group versus continuing to hold it for use 
we currently believe we are more likely to continue to hold this asset group than sell it  however  if the probability associated with selling it were increased to approximately percent  these assets may not be recoverable 
if our recoverability estimates had resulted in a determination that these assets were not recoverable  based on our current estimates of fair value  we would have recognized an impairment loss of approximately million to million in the year ended december  our current estimate of recoverability for certain canadian gas processing assets indicated that they were not recoverable due to management s expectation that these assets would be sold at a price less than their current carrying value 
as a result  we recognized impairment charges of million during we estimated fair market value using an earnings multiple applied to projected operating results 
we validated this estimate of fair value with discounted future cash flows ranging from approximately million above and million below our estimated fair value 
contingent liabilities we record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies when we assess that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which new or different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
liabilities for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions and estimates  and advice of legal counsel or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
as new developments occur or more information becomes available  it is possible that our assumptions and estimates in these matters will change 
changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes different from our current assumptions and estimates could materially affect future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents oil and gas producing activities we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
estimated natural gas and oil reserves and or forward market prices for oil and gas are a significant part of our financial calculations 
following are examples of how these estimates affect financial results an increase decrease in estimated proved oil and gas reserves can reduce increase our unit of production depletion rate 
changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas properties 
these projected future cash flows are used to estimate the fair value of oil and gas properties for purposes of assessing them for impairment  and to estimate the fair value of the exploration production reporting unit for purposes of assessing its goodwill for impairment 
certain estimated reserves are used as collateral to secure financing 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant judgement in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
after being estimated internally  virtually all of our reserve estimates are either audited or prepared by independent experts 
the data may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates could occur from time to time 
a reasonably likely revision of our reserve estimates is not expected to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or goodwill 
however  reserve estimate revisions would impact our depreciation and depletion expense prospectively 
for example  a change of approximately percent in oil and gas reserves for each basin would change our annual depreciation  depletion and amortization expense between approximately million and million 
the actual impact would depend on the specific basins impacted 
forward market prices include estimates of prices for periods that extend beyond those with quoted market prices 
this forward market price information is consistent with that generally used in evaluating drilling decisions and acquisition plans 
these market prices for future periods impact the production economics underlying oil and gas reserve estimates 
the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period thus impacting our estimates 
a reasonably likely unfavorable change in the forward price curve is not expected to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or goodwill

our revenue increased billion due primarily to increased revenues at our williams power company segment power and our midstream gas and liquids segment midstream as a result of the january  adoption of eitf  which requires that revenues and costs of sale from non derivative contracts and certain physically settled derivative contracts be reported on a gross basis see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact on our financial statements as a result of 
table of contents applying this consensus 
prior to the adoption of eitf  revenues and costs of sales related to non derivative contracts and certain physically settled derivative contracts were reported in revenues on a net basis 
as permitted by eitf  prior year amounts have not been restated 
power s external revenues increased billion and midstream s external revenues increased billion due primarily to the effect of eitf the increase in revenues also includes million due primarily to higher natural gas liquids ngl revenues at our midstream segment s gas processing plants as a result of moderate market price increases  partially offset by lower ngl production volumes 
results for include approximately million of revenue related to the correction of the accounting treatment previously applied to certain third party derivative contracts during and this matter was initially disclosed in our form q for the second quarter of income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles in was million 
absent the corrections  we would have reported a pretax loss from continuing operations in approximately million of this revenue relates to a correction of net energy trading assets for certain derivative contract terminations occurring in the remaining million relates to net gains on certain other derivative contracts entered into in and that we now believe should not have been deferred as a component of other comprehensive income due to the incorrect designation of these contracts as cash flow hedges 
our management  after consultation with our independent auditor  concluded that the effect of the previous accounting treatment was not material to and prior periods and the trend of earnings 
costs and operating expenses increased billion due primarily to the effect of reporting certain costs gross at power and midstream  as discussed above 
costs increased billion at power and billion at midstream due primarily to the effect of eitf contributing to the increase at our midstream segment is million attributable to rising market prices for natural gas used to replace the heating value of ngls extracted at their gas processing facilities 
the cost increases at these operating units were partially offset by billion higher intercompany eliminations resulting primarily from intercompany costs that were previously netted in revenues prior to the adoption of eitf selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million due primarily to reduced staffing levels at power reflective of our strategy to exit this business 
also contributing to the decrease was the absence of million of costs related to an enhanced benefit early retirement option offered to certain employee groups in we expect continued declines in these costs as we continue to exit the power business and complete our planned asset sales 
other income expense net  within operating income  in includes a million gain from the sale of a power contract  million in net gains from the sale of our exploration production segment s interests in certain natural gas properties in the san juan basin  a million gain from midstream s sale of the wholesale propane business  and a million gain on foreign currency exchange at power 
partially offsetting these gains was a million goodwill impairment at power  a million impairment of the hazelton generation plant at power  a million impairment of canadian assets at midstream  a million charge to write off capitalized software development costs at northwest pipeline  a million charge related to a settlement by power with the commodity futures trading commission see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and a million accrual at power related to an adjustment of california rate refund and other related accruals 
other income expense net  within operating income  in includes million of impairment charges  loss accruals  and write offs within power  including a partial impairment of goodwill  million in net gains from the sale of exploration production s interests in natural gas properties and million of impairment charges related to midstream s canadian assets 
general corporate expenses decreased million 
during  we incurred million of various restructuring costs associated with the liquidity and business issues addressed beginning third quarter we also incurred million higher advertising and branding costs in due primarily to golf events and other advertising campaigns that were not continued in 
in  we will continue efforts to further reduce our corporate cost structure following the recent and anticipated divestitures 
we could also experience 
table of contents additional decreases in costs related to our health care plan for retirees as a result of the passage of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of interest accrued net increased million  or percent  due primarily to million higher interest expense and fees primarily related to the rmt note payable  which was prepaid in may see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  an million increase in capitalized interest  which offsets interest accrued  due primarily to midstream s projects in the gulf coast region  million higher amortization expense related to deferred debt issuance costs including a million write off of accelerated amortization of costs from the termination of a revolving credit agreement in june see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  a million increase reflecting higher average interest rates on long term debt  a million decrease reflecting lower average borrowing levels  and million of interest expense of power as a result of certain ferc proceedings 
we expect interest expense to decrease in due to reduced averaged borrowing levels and lower average interest rates 
in  we began entering into interest rate swaps with external counter parties primarily in support of the energy trading portfolio see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the change in market value of these swaps was million more favorable in than  due largely to a reduction in overall swap positions during the second half of the total notional amount of these swaps is approximately million at december  investing income increased to million in compared to a million loss in as detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  investing income loss in includes million lower equity earnings from gulfstream natural gas system llc  primarily resulting from the absence in of a million contractual construction completion fee received in  million higher net interest income at power as a result of certain ferc proceedings  and a million impairment related to our investment in longhorn partners pipeline lp investing income loss in includes a million loss provision relating to the estimated recoverability of receivables from wiltel communications group  inc wiltel  a former subsidiary  partially offset by equity earnings and a million gain on the sale of all of our interest in a lithuanian oil refinery  pipeline and terminal complex 
minority interest in income and preferred returns of consolidated subsidiaries in is lower than due primarily to the absence of preferred returns totaling million on the preferred interests in castle associates lp  piceance production holdings lp  and williams risk holdings llc  which were modified and reclassified as debt in third quarter  and arctic fox  llc  which was modified and reclassified as debt in april see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income net  below operating income  in includes debt tender and related costs of million  which were incurred in related to the third quarter tender offers and consent solicitations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may pursue additional debt tender offers in in addition  million of foreign currency transaction gains on a canadian dollar denominated note receivable are included 
partially offsetting these gains were million of derivative losses on a forward contract to fix the us dollar principal cash flows from this note 
in  these may be less offsetting since the note receivable balance was substantially reduced in the last half of 
table of contents the provision benefit for income taxes was unfavorable by million due primarily to pre tax income in as compared to a pre tax loss in the effective income tax rate for is significantly higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to non deductible impairment of goodwill  non deductible expenses  an accrual for tax contingencies  and the effect of state income taxes  somewhat offset by the tax benefit of capital losses 
the effective income tax rate for is less than the federal statutory rate due primarily to the tax benefit of capital losses and the effect of state income taxes  somewhat offset by the effect of taxes on foreign operations  non deductible impairment of goodwill  an accrual for tax contingencies  and income tax credit recapture that reduced the tax benefit of the pre tax loss 
in addition to the operating results from activities included in discontinued operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the loss from discontinued operations includes pre tax gains and losses on sales  net of impairments  totaling million 
the million consists primarily of the following a million gain on sale of williams energy partners  a million gain on sale of canadian liquids operations  a million gain on sale of natural gas properties in the raton basin in southern colorado and the hugoton embayment in southwestern kansas  a million impairment of gulf liquids  a million impairment net of a million gain on sale of texas gas transmission  and a million loss on sale and impairment on assets of the soda ash mining facility located in colorado

our revenue decreased approximately billion  or percent  due primarily to lower revenues associated with energy risk management and trading activities at power and the absence of million of revenue related to the convenience stores sold in may within our previously reported petroleum services segment petroleum services 
partially offsetting these decreases was the impact of an increase in net production volumes within exploration production partly due to the august acquisition of barrett resources corporation barrett 
as permitted by eitf  discussed above  and revenues were not restated for the adoption of eitf in january costs and operating expenses decreased million  or percent  due primarily to the absence of the convenience stores sold in may and lower fuel and product shrink gas purchases related to processing activities at midstream 
slightly offsetting these decreases are increased depletion  depreciation and amortization and lease operating expenses at exploration production due primarily to the addition of the former barrett operations 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million due primarily to lower variable compensation levels at power

general corporate expenses increased million  or percent  due primarily to approximately million of various restructuring costs associated with the liquidity and business issues addressed beginning third quarter  million of expense related to the enhanced benefit early retirement program offered to certain employee groups and million of expense related to employee severance costs 
partially offsetting these increases were lower charitable contributions and advertising costs 
operating income decreased  million  or percent  due primarily to lower net revenues associated with energy risk management and trading activities at power and the impairment charges and loss accruals noted above 
partially offsetting these decreases are the gains from the sales of natural gas production properties and the impact of increased net production volumes at exploration production  higher demand revenues and the effect of the reductions in rate refund liabilities associated with rate case settlements at gas pipeline  higher natural gas liquids margins at midstream and higher equity earnings

other income expense net  below operating income  decreased million due primarily to an million gain in second quarter at our gas pipeline segment associated with the disposition of securities received through a mutual insurance company reorganization  a million decrease in losses from the sales of receivables to special purpose entities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and the absence in of a million payment to settle a claim for coal royalty payments relating to a discontinued activity 
partially offsetting these increases was an million loss related to early retirement of remarketable notes in first quarter the provision benefit for income taxes was favorable by million due primarily to a pre tax loss in as compared to pre tax income in the effective income tax rate for is less than the federal statutory rate due primarily to the tax benefit of capital losses and the effect of state income taxes  somewhat offset by the effect of taxes on foreign operations  non deductible impairment of goodwill  an accrual for tax contingencies  and income tax credits recapture that reduced the tax benefit of the pre tax loss

partially offsetting these impairments and losses was a pre tax gain of million related to the sale of the mid america and seminole pipelines 
loss from discontinued operations in includes a billion pre tax charge for loss accruals related to guarantees and payment obligations for wiltel and million of other pre tax charges for impairments and loss accruals  including a million pre tax impairment charge related to the soda ash mining facility 
income loss applicable to common stock in reflects the impact of the million associated with accounting for a preferred security that contains a conversion option that was beneficial to the purchaser at the time the security was issued 
the weighted average number of shares in for the diluted calculation which is the same as the basic calculation since we reported a loss from continuing operations increased approximately million from december  the increase is due primarily to the million shares issued in the barrett acquisition in august 
table of contents results of operations segments we are currently organized into the following segments power formerly named energy marketing trading  gas pipeline  exploration production  midstream and other 
the petroleum services segment is now reported within other as a result of the alaska refinery and related assets being reflected as discontinued operations 
other primarily consists of corporate operations and certain continuing operations previously reported within the international and petroleum services segments 
our management currently evaluates performance based on segment profit loss from operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior period amounts have been restated to reflect these changes 
the following discussions relate to the results of operations of our segments 
power overview of as described below  a strategic change in business focus and a required change in accounting principles significantly influenced power s operating results 
in june  we announced our intent to exit our power business and reduce our financial commitment to the power segment 
prior to this point  power focused on originating short term and long term contracts that it considered profitable based on its view of the market 
beginning in mid  power now focuses on terminating or selling all or portions of the portfolio  maximizing cash flow  reducing risk  and managing existing contractual commitments  many of which are long term 
we initiated efforts to sell all or portions of power s power  natural gas  and crude and refined products portfolios in mid based on bids received in these sales efforts  power recognized impairments for certain assets and capital projects in in  we continued our efforts to exit this business 
in  proceeds from contract sales and terminations exceeded carrying values  resulting in gains 
the decision to exit the power business also resulted in decreased selling  general and administrative expense 
segment profit was unfavorably impacted in as a result of reduced origination of long term energy related transactions 
as discussed further in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  in  power adopted eitf  which changed the classification of certain revenues and costs in the statement of operations and the accounting method for non derivative energy and energy related contracts 
decreased power prices and increased natural gas prices primarily caused an increase in the fair value of power and gas derivative contracts  which is reflected as an increase in earnings 
due to the change in accounting method discussed further below  the related change in fair value of non derivative contracts was not recognized in earnings during since non derivative contracts are no longer marked to market 
however  accrual losses on power and gas non derivative contracts were recognized in power considers key factors that influence its financial condition and operating performance to include the following prices of power and natural gas  including changes in the margin between power and natural gas prices  changes in market liquidity  including changes in the ability to economically hedge the portfolio  changes in power and natural gas price volatility  changes in the regulatory environment  and changes in power and natural gas supply and demand 
outlook for in  power anticipates further variability in earnings due in part to the difference in accounting treatment of derivative contracts at fair value and our underlying non derivative contracts on an accrual basis 

table of contents this difference in accounting treatment combined with the volatile nature of energy commodity markets could result in future operating gains or losses 
some of power s tolling contracts have a negative fair value  which is not reflected in the financial statements since these contracts are not derivatives 
these tolling contracts may result in future accrual losses 
continued efforts to sell all or a portion of the portfolio may also have a significant impact on future earnings as proceeds may differ significantly from carrying values 
the inability of counterparties to perform under contractual obligations due to their own credit constraints could also affect future operations 
the following risks and challenges also impact how power manages its business and affect its operating results unresolved litigation  regulatory changes and oversight  lack of liquidity  and key employee retention 
year over year operating results years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit loss vs 
increase in revenues and cost of sales eitf impacts how power presents revenues and costs from certain transactions in the statement of operations 
the table below summarizes items included in revenues and costs before and after january  before after revenues revenues gains and losses from changes in fair value of all energy trading contracts with a future settlement or delivery date and from changes in fair value of commodity inventories gains and losses from changes in fair value of only derivative contracts with a future settlement or delivery date revenue from sales of commodities or completion of energy related services revenue from sales of commodities or completion of energy related services gains and losses from net financial settlement of derivative contracts gains and losses from net financial settlement of derivative contracts costs from purchases of commodities or fees from energy related services that were not associated with property  plant and equipment we owned costs costs costs from purchases of commodities or fees for energy related services for use in property  plant and equipment that we owned costs from purchases of all commodities and fees paid for energy related services revenues increased billion and costs increased billion from to primarily because power now reports certain purchases in costs instead of reporting them as reduction of revenues 
this change in reporting does not affect gross margin or segment profit 
eitf does not require restatement of prior 
table of contents year amounts 
as presented in the table that follows this section  power also now accounts for a significant portion of its business activity using the accrual method of accounting rather than recognizing changes in fair value through segment profit  or mark to market accounting 
increase in segment profit eitf  which was implemented january   significantly impacted the increase in segment profit from to before the adoption of eitf  power reported the fair value of all its energy contracts  energy related contracts and inventory on the balance sheet 
power reported changes in the fair value of the items from period to period in segment profit 
examples of derivative and non derivative contracts are as follows derivative contracts non derivative contracts forward purchase and sale contracts spot purchase and sale contracts futures contracts transportation contracts option contracts storage contracts swap agreements tolling agreements power conversion contracts full requirement or load serving contracts power sales contracts in which we supply all of the customer s requirements for power in  power continues to reflect the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in segment profit 
however  for non derivative contracts  power does not recognize revenue until commodities are delivered or services are completed 
also  for non derivative contracts  power does not recognize costs until products are received and consumed  services are used  or inventories are sold 
power is exposed to earnings fluctuations because of these differences in accounting for derivative and non derivative contracts within its portfolio 
the following example illustrates this exposure to earnings fluctuations assume there are two contracts 
the first is a ten year contract in which power agrees to pay a counterparty a monthly fee for the right to convert natural gas to power a tolling contract 
power has the right to sell the power produced under the tolling contract 
the contract is not a derivative 
the second is a derivative contract to sell power in to another party for a fixed price  entered into to fix the sales price of the power produced in under the tolling contract 
therefore  the power sales contract economically hedges the forward power price component of the tolling contract 
if power prices fall  the decline in fair value of the tolling agreement would not be reflected in segment profit since the contract is not a derivative 
the increase in the fair value of the power sale contract  however  would be reflected in segment profit since it is a derivative 
as illustrated in the above example  many of our derivative contracts serve as economic hedges of our non derivative positions 
we could reduce our exposure to earnings fluctuations by applying hedge accounting  as provided for under sfas no 
however  since we have announced our intent to exit the business  we do not currently meet the criteria to be eligible for hedge accounting 
we reduced our exposure to earnings fluctuations through election of the normal purchases and sales exception available under sfas no 
for two significant long term derivative contracts 
these two derivative contracts hedge a tolling contract 
since the election in the second quarter of  we account for the two derivative contracts on an accrual basis 
however  we remain exposed to earnings fluctuations from changes in fair value of certain other derivative positions 

table of contents the following table summarizes the major elements impacting segment profit in and years ended december  millions accrual earnings losses mark to market earnings losses interest rate portfolio earnings losses origination prior period adjustments gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses other income expense net segment profit loss increase in gross margin the impact of the earnings fluctuations discussed in the previous section is reflected in our gross margin 
gross margin increased from a margin loss of million in to a gross margin of million in accrual earnings losses on contracts and assets in accounted for on an accrual basis partially offset increases in gross margin from mark to market earnings as discussed in the next section 
in  we accounted for revenues and costs generated only on our owned assets on an accrual basis 
these owned assets resulted in a million gross margin in in  we also accounted for revenues and costs generated on our non derivative contracts on an accrual basis 
the owned assets and non derivative contracts generated a million margin loss in the million margin loss primarily consists of accrual losses of million on non derivative contracts and owned assets within our power and natural gas portfolios 
as with forward power prices  the increased power supply in the mid continent and eastern regions contributed to lower prices received on power sales in  primarily contributing to the accrual losses 
the million also includes a million loss from increased power rate refunds owed to the state of california because of ferc rulings issued and a million loss for other contingencies related to our power marketing activities in the state of california 
mark to market earnings the difference in accounting for non derivative contracts in compared to primarily contributed to the increase in gross margin 
in  we recognized mark to market losses of million on derivative contracts and non derivative contracts  both of which we carried at fair value  or marked to market  in in  we recognized mark to market gains of million on derivative contracts only 
we refer to net realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts carried at fair value as mark to market earnings 
derivative contracts within our power and natural gas portfolios primarily contributed to the mark to market gains in  generating million of the total mark to market gains of million 
decreased forward power prices on net power sales contracts and increased forward gas prices on net gas purchase contracts primarily caused the mark to market gains from power and natural gas derivative contracts 
increased power supply in the mid continent and eastern us significantly contributed to the decrease in forward power prices 
a million positive valuation adjustment on a terminated derivative contract also contributed to the mark to market gains on power and natural gas derivative contracts 
of the million in mark to market losses in  million related to the power and natural gas portfolios 
the fair value of certain tolling portfolios decreased as the margin between forward power prices 
table of contents and the estimated cost to produce the power decreased 
the decline in volatility of the power and natural gas markets also contributed to the decrease in the fair value of tolling contracts within certain of our tolling portfolios as it does other option contracts 
tolling contracts possess characteristics of options since we have the right but not the obligation to request the plant owner to convert natural gas to power 
valuation methods used in are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
power and natural gas mark to market losses in also reflected a million valuation adjustment on certain non derivative power sale contracts 
quotes received during sales efforts in resulted in the valuation adjustment 
the favorable net effect of approximately million resulting from a settlement with the state of california partially offsets the mark to market losses 
the million primarily reflects the increase in fair value on power sales contracts with the california department of water resources  which resulted from a restructuring of the contracts and the improved credit standing of the counterparty 
interest rate portfolio differences in the treatment of interest rate movements in compared to also offset the increase in gross margin 
the interest rate earnings of million reflect the impact of decreased interest rates on power  natural gas and crude and refined derivative and non derivative contracts 
as interest rates decreased  the overall fair value of these commodity contracts increased 
the increase in the fair value of these contracts was partially offset by the decrease in the fair value of interest rate derivatives 
interest rate derivatives hedge the power  natural gas and crude and refined products contracts on an economic basis 
the interest rate loss of million reflects the mark to market loss on interest rate derivatives only 
origination the lack of contract origination in further offsets the increase in gross margin 
consistent with our reduced financial commitment to the power business  we did not originate long term energy related contracts in in  we recognized million of power and natural gas revenues and million of petroleum products revenues by originating new contracts 
correction of prior period items results for include approximately million of revenue related to the correction of the accounting treatment previously applied to certain third party derivative contracts during and this matter was initially disclosed in our form q for the second quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses the reduced focus on the power business resulted in further employee reductions in power employed approximately employees at the end of compared to approximately at the end of this decrease in employees was the primary factor in the million  or percent  decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
increase in other income expense net other income expense net improved million 
power terminated or sold certain contracts and other assets  resulting in losses in and gains in in  power terminated certain power related capital projects  which resulted in million of impairments 
power also recorded a million impairment in from the january sale of the worthington generation facility 
in  power sold a non derivative energy trading contract resulting in a million gain on sale 
power also sold an interest in certain investments accounted for under the cost method in for a gain of million 
a million goodwill impairment in compared to a million goodwill impairment in also contributed to the increase in other income expense net 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other factors offset the increase in other income expense net 
in  power recognized a million impairment on a power generating facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
power also reached a settlement with the commodity futures trading commission as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  resulting in a charge of million 
finally  power 
table of contents recorded accruals of million for power marketing activities in california during and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
vs 
the  million  or percent  decrease in revenues is due primarily to a  million decrease in risk management and trading revenues 
during  the impact of market movements against power s portfolio and a significant reduction in origination activities adversely affected our results 
power s ability to manage or hedge its portfolio against adverse market movements was limited by a lack of market liquidity as well as our limited ability to provide credit and liquidity support 
the decrease in risk management and trading revenues includes the following  million decrease in natural gas and power revenues  million increase in petroleum products revenues  million increase in european trading revenues  and million increase in interest rate revenues 
the net impact of interest rate movements  including the impact of interest derivatives  caused the million increase in interest rate revenues 
the  million decrease in risk management and trading revenues includes a million decrease in revenues from new transactions originated and contract amendments as compared to a decline in natural gas revenues caused million of the  million decline in natural gas and power revenues 
increasing prices on short natural gas positions during the third quarter of primarily caused the decline in natural gas revenues 
the remaining  million decline in natural gas and power revenues relates to lower revenues from the power portfolio caused primarily by smaller differences in the margin between forward power prices and the estimated cost to produce the power on certain power tolling portfolios  lower volatility compared with  and the net impact of portfolio valuation adjustments associated with the decline in market liquidity and portfolio liquidation activities 
origination activities during the first quarter of primarily caused the million increase in petroleum products revenues 
the commencement of trading activities in the european office as compared to start up activities in principally drove the million increase in european trading revenues 
the european operations were being wound down in as a result of our liquidity constraints  we initiated efforts in to sell all or portions of power s portfolio and or pursue potential joint venture or business combination opportunities 
portions of power s portfolio were recognized at their estimated fair value  which under generally accepted accounting principles is the amount at which they could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced liquidation or sale 
as a result of information obtained through the portfolio sales efforts in  power adjusted the estimated fair value of certain portions of the portfolio to reflect viable market information received 
for those portions of the portfolio for which no viable market information was received through sales efforts  power estimated fair value using other market based information and consistent application of valuation techniques 
portfolio valuation adjustments recognized in as a result of new market information obtained through sales efforts resulted in a million decrease in segment profit 
revenues for also includes the favorable fourth quarter net effect of approximately million resulting from the settlement with the state of california  the restructuring of associated energy contracts  and the related improved credit situation of the counterparties during the quarter 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased by million  or percent 
lower variable compensation levels and staff reductions primarily caused this cost reduction 

table of contents other income expense net in includes the following impairments and loss accruals associated with commitments for certain power projects that have been terminated of million  partial impairment of goodwill of million  reflecting a decline in fair value resulting from deteriorating market conditions during  and impairment charge related to the january sale of the worthington generation facility of million 
other income expense net in included a million charge due to a terminated expansion project 
the  million  or percent decrease in segment profit loss is due primarily to the  million reduction of risk management and trading revenues and the other income expense net items  partially offset by the million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  and the million charge from the write downs in of marketable equity securities and a cost based investment see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gas pipeline overview of gas pipeline s interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the ferc and as such  our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  and the extension  enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting  among other things  are subject to regulation 
the rates are established through the ferc s rulemaking process 
as a result of this regulation  gas pipeline s revenues and operating costs are relatively stable  with fluctuations primarily driven by the approval by the ferc of new rates  the level of pipeline transportation capacity used and seasonal demands 
therefore capacity is a significant factor for revenues and ultimately segment profit 
during  gas pipeline completed five major expansion projects 
the combined impact of the completed projects resulted in the following northwest pipeline created  dth d of new physical capacity 
installed more than miles of new pipeline looping in washington  idaho  and wyoming 
transco increased capacity by  dth d 
installed more than miles of new pipeline 
significant risk factors that could affect the profitability of our gas pipeline segment include legal and regulatory events such as ferc rate authorization and or rate case settlements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  market demand for expansion projects to increase revenue and segment profit  and catastrophic events to our infrastructure such as ruptures to pipelines 
outlook for in december  we received an order from the us department of transportation regarding restoration of transportation service on a segment of a natural gas pipeline in western washington 
the pipeline experienced a line break in may and we subsequently received an order to lower pressure by percent and perform an integrity study on the pipeline segment 
the pipeline experienced a second break in 
table of contents the same segment in december in december  we idled the pipeline segment until its integrity could be assured 
the decision to idle the pipeline has not had a significant impact on our ability to meet market demand  primarily because we have a parallel pipeline in the same corridor 
we have  thus far  been able to meet customers demand including peak loads during january but  during the non peak demands of spring and summer when gas on gas competition can be strong  customers may have to take gas from other than preferred sources 
if we are unable to meet customers demand  then we may have to reduce our billings to them 
the future costs to first restore portions of the existing pipeline to temporary service and then to replace the pipeline s capacity entirely are expected to be in the range of approximately million to million over a three year period  the majority of which will be spent in and we expect to have adequate financial resources to comply with the order and replace the capacity  if required 
in february  gas pipeline placed a pipeline expansion into service increasing capacity on its transco natural gas system by  dth d 
the completed projects for northwest pipeline and transco are expected to increase revenues in by approximately million 
the majority of the planned capital expenditures is expected to be spent on maintenance of the pipelines 
year over year operating results during  we sold texas gas transmission corporation texas gas 
we received million in cash and the buyer assumed million in debt 
during  we sold both our central and kern river interstate natural gas pipeline businesses 
the following discussions exclude any gains or losses on such sales and the results of operations related to texas gas  central  and kern river  which are all reported within discontinued operations 
the following discussions relate to the current continuing businesses of our gas pipeline segment which includes transco  northwest pipeline and various joint venture projects 
certain assets sold during are included in the results 
these assets include cove point  a general partner interest in northern border  and our percent interest in alliance pipeline 
these assets represented million of revenues and million of segment profit for the year ended december  years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit vs 
the million  or five percent  increase in revenues is due primarily to million higher demand revenues on the transco system resulting from new expansion projects marketlink  momentum and sundance and higher rates approved under transco s rate proceedings that became effective in late and million on the northwest pipeline system resulting from new projects gray s harbor  centralia  and chehalis 
partially offsetting these increases was the absence in of million of revenue from reductions in the rate refund liabilities and other adjustments associated with a rate case settlement on transco in and million lower storage demand revenues in due to lower storage rates in connection with transco s rate proceedings that became effective in late cost and operating expenses increased million  or four percent  due primarily to million higher depreciation expense due to additional property  plant and equipment placed into service and million higher state sales and use  ad valorem and franchise taxes 
these increases were partially offset by million lower fuel expense on transco  resulting primarily from pricing differentials on the volumes of gas used in operation 
costs and operating expenses are projected to be approximately million higher in due primarily to non capitalized maintenance projects 
general and administrative costs decreased million  or percent  due primarily to the absence in of million of early retirement pension costs recorded in and other employee related benefits 
table of contents costs associated with reduced employee levels as well as the absence of a million write off in of capitalized software development costs resulting from cancellation of a project 
general and administrative costs in are projected to be consistent with amounts 
other income expense net in includes a million charge at northwest pipeline to write off capitalized software development costs for a service delivery system 
subsequent to the implementation of the same system at transco in the second quarter of and a determination of the unique and additional programming requirements that would be needed to complete the system at northwest pipeline  management determined that the system would not be implemented at northwest pipeline 
other income expense net in also includes million of income at transco due to a partial reduction of accrued liabilities for claims associated with certain producers as a result of recent settlements and court rulings 
other income expense net in includes a million charge associated with a ferc penalty see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and a million loss on the sale of the cove point facility 
summarized changes in gas pipeline s segment profit segment profit  which includes equity earnings and income loss from investments included in investing income loss  increased million  or two percent  due to the following favorable items the million increase in revenues  the million decrease in general and administrative costs  the absence of the million ferc charge in discussed above  and the absence of the million write off of gas pipeline s investment in a cancelled pipeline project and a million loss on the sale of gas pipeline s percent ownership interest in alliance pipeline in both items were included in income loss from investment  which is included in investing income loss 
these increases to segment profit were partially offset by the following million lower equity earnings included in investing income loss  the million charge at northwest pipeline to write off capitalized software costs discussed previously  the million higher operating costs  and the absence of an million gain in on the sale of our general partnership interest in northern border partners  lp the million decrease to equity earnings reflects million lower equity earnings from gulfstream  the absence of a million benefit in related to the contractual construction completion fee received by an equity affiliate and the absence of million of equity earnings following the october sale of gas pipeline s percent ownership in alliance pipeline 
the lower earnings for gulfstream were primarily due to the absence in of interest capitalized on internally generated funds as allowed by the ferc during construction 
the gulfstream pipeline was placed into service during second quarter vs 
the million  or five percent  increase in revenues is due primarily to million higher demand revenues on the transco system resulting from new expansion projects and new settlement rates effective september  and million impact of reductions in the rate refund liabilities associated with rate case settlements on the transco system 
revenue also increased due to million higher transportation revenue on the northwest pipeline system  million from environmental mitigation credit sales and services and million higher revenues associated with tracked costs  which are passed through to customers offset in general and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these increases were million lower gas exchange imbalance settlements offset in costs and operating expenses  million lower storage revenues and 
table of contents million lower revenues associated with the recovery of tracked costs which are passed through to customers offset in costs and operating expenses 
the decrease in storage revenues noted above is primarily due to million lower rates on cove point s short term storage contracts the cove point facility was sold in september and a million decrease at transco due primarily to lower storage demand 
costs and operating expenses decreased million  or five percent  due primarily to million lower gas exchange imbalance settlements offset in revenues  million lower operations and maintenance expense due primarily to lower professional and other contractual services and telecommunications expenses  million lower other tracked costs which are passed through to customers offset in revenues and a million franchise tax refund for transco 
these decreases were partially offset by the million effect in of a regulatory reserve reversal resulting from the ferc s approval for recovery of fuel costs incurred in prior periods by transco  as well as million higher depreciation expense 
the million higher depreciation expense reflects a million increase due to increased property  plant and equipment placed into service including depletion of property held for the environmental mitigation credit sales  partially offset by a million adjustment related to the rate case settlements resulting in lower depreciation rates applied retroactively 
general and administrative costs increased million  or percent  due primarily to million higher employee related benefits expense  including million related to higher pension and retiree medical expense due to decreases in assumed return on plan assets  and approximately million related to expense recognized as a result of accelerated company contributions to an employee stock ownership plan 
also contributing to the increase is million in costs associated with an early retirement program  a million write off in of capitalized software development costs resulting from cancellation of a project  and million higher tracked costs offset in revenues 
these increases were partially offset by million lower charitable contributions in other income expense net in includes a million charge associated with a ferc penalty see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and a million loss on the sale of the cove point facility 
other income expense net in includes an million charge resulting from the unfavorable court decision and resulting settlement in one of transco s royalty claims proceedings an additional million is included in interest expense 
summarized changes in gas pipeline s segment profit segment profit  which includes equity earnings and income loss from investments both included in investing income loss  increased million  or percent  due primarily to the following million higher demand revenues discussed above  million higher equity earnings included in investing income loss  million lower costs and operating expenses discussed above  the effect of the million charge discussed previously in other income expense net  the million effect of rate refund liability reductions related to the finalization of rate cases during third quarter  and an million gain in on the sale of our general partnership interest in northern border partners  lp these increases were partially offset by the following items the effect of a million gain in from the sale of our limited partnership interest in northern border partners  lp  
table of contents the million increase in general and administrative costs discussed above  the million ferc penalty and the million loss on the sale of the cove point facility discussed above in other income expense  a million write down in of gas pipeline s investment in a cancelled pipeline project  and a loss of million on the sale of gas pipeline s percent ownership interest in alliance pipeline 
the million increase in equity earnings includes a million benefit in related to the contractual construction completion fee received by an equity affiliate 
this equity affiliate served as the general contractor on the gulfstream pipeline project for gulfstream natural gas system gulfstream  an interstate natural gas pipeline subject to ferc regulation and an equity affiliate 
the fee  paid by gulfstream and associated with the completion during the second quarter of of the construction of gulfstream s pipeline  was capitalized by gulfstream as property  plant and equipment and is included in gulfstream s rate base to be recovered in future revenues 
additionally  the increase in equity earnings reflects an million increase from gulfstream  million of which is related to interest capitalized on the gulfstream pipeline project in accordance with ferc regulations 
exploration production overview of our focus within exploration production is to develop  produce and explore for natural gas reserves in the rocky mountain and mid continent regions 
we are currently one of the top producers in the rocky mountain region 
our specialty is extracting natural gas from non conventional tight sands and coalbed methane formations 
almost all of our natural gas production is sold to williams power segment 
we maintain a leadership presence in the following strategic natural gas basins piceance basin in western colorado  powder river basin in northeastern wyoming  san juan basin  which stretches from northwestern new mexico into colorado  and arkoma basin in southeastern oklahoma 
these basins are core to our future success with a large portion of our proved reserves being undeveloped 
thus  we plan to maintain a significant drilling program over the next several years 
in addition  we manage other oil and gas interests  including an international oil and gas company  apco argentina  inc  in which we own an approximate percent interest 
during the first half of  our strategy focused on selling assets and reducing our development drilling activity in order to raise or preserve cash to strengthen our balance sheet 
in the second half of the year  after we had successfully paid down or refinanced certain debt  we resumed development drilling to levels similar to those achieved in the major accomplishments for the exploration production segment during included the following completed the targeted asset sales of properties located primarily in kansas  colorado  utah and new mexico 
we received net proceeds of approximately million resulting in net pre tax gains of approximately million  including million of pre tax gains reported in discontinued operations related to the interests in the raton and hugoton basins 
achieved a reserves replacement rate of over percent for our core retained basins 
overall  our reserves replacement rate was approximately percent 

table of contents increased our development drilling program in the latter part of the year  returning to activity levels reached prior to capital expenditures for were approximately million 
decreased our selling  general and administrative costs by million 
outlook for our expectations for the exploration production segment in include a continuing development drilling program in our key basins with an increase in activity in the piceance basin 
increasing our current production level of mmcfe per day by to percent by the end of approximately percent of our forecasted production is hedged at prices that average per mcfe at a basin level 
approximately percent of our estimated production is hedged at prices that average above per mcfe at the basin level 
risks that may prevent us from fully accomplishing our objectives include drilling rig availability  obtaining permits as planned for drilling and any potential capital constraints 
year over year operating results the following discussions of the year over year results primarily relate to our continuing operations 
however  the results do include those operations that were sold during or that did not qualify for discontinued operations reporting 
the operations in the hugoton and raton basins qualified for discontinued operations 
years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit vs 
the million  or nine percent decrease in revenues is due primarily to million lower production revenues due to lower production levels as the result of property sales and reduced drilling activities and million lower other revenues primarily due to the absence in of deferred income relating to transactions in prior years that transferred certain economic benefits to a third party 
the decrease in domestic production revenues reflects million associated with an eleven percent decrease in net domestic production volumes  partially offset by million higher revenues from increased net realized average prices for production 
net realized average prices include the effect of hedge positions 
the decrease in production volumes primarily results from the sales of properties in and and the impact of reduced drilling activity 
drilling activity was lower in the january through august period of due to our capital constraints 
during the third quarter  drilling activities on our retained properties began to increase and by the fourth quarter of returned to the levels more consistent with drilling levels 
this drilling level is expected to increase production volumes in the future 
to minimize the risk and volatility associated with the ownership of producing gas properties  we enter into derivative forward sales contracts  which economically lock in a price for a portion of our future production 
approximately percent of domestic production in was hedged 
these hedging decisions are made considering our overall commodity risk exposure 
costs and expenses  including selling  general and administrative expenses  decreased million  reflecting million lower exploration expenses reflecting the current focus of the company on developing proved properties while reducing exploratory activities  
table of contents million lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense primarily as a result of lower production volumes  million lower selling general and administrative expense  and million higher operating taxes due primarily to higher market prices 
other income expense net in includes approximately million in net gains on sales of natural gas properties during  which were discussed previously 
other income expense net in includes approximately million in net gains on sales of natural gas properties during the million decrease in segment profit is partially due to million lower net gains on sales of assets in as compared to  as discussed above 
additionally  lower production revenues due primarily to lower production volumes also contributed to the decrease 
segment profit also includes million and million related to international activities for and  respectively 
this increase primarily reflects improved operating results of apco argentina 
vs 
the million  or percent  increase in revenues is primarily due to million higher domestic production revenues  million in unrealized gains from mark to market financial instruments related to basis differentials on natural gas production  and million lower domestic gas management revenues 
the million increase in domestic production revenues includes million associated with an increase in net domestic production volumes  resulting primarily from the acquisition in third quarter of the former barrett operations 
the increase in our revenues also includes million from increased net realized average prices for production including the effect of hedge positions 
approximately percent of domestic production in was hedged 
costs and operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million  due primarily to the addition of the former barrett operations 
increased costs include depreciation  depletion and amortization  lease operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
these increases were partially offset by decreased gas management purchase costs 
other income expense net in includes million and million in gains from the sales of substantially all of our interests in natural gas production properties in the jonah field wyoming and in the anadarko basin  respectively 
segment profit increased million due primarily to the gains from asset sales mentioned in the preceding paragraph  increased production volumes  and higher net realized average prices 
segment profit also includes million and million related to international activities for and  respectively 
midstream gas liquids overview of in  we continued to execute our strategy to focus on targeted growth areas in the four corners  rockies and gulf coast production areas 
pursuing our strategy  we placed into service significant pipeline infrastructure in the deepwater offshore area of the gulf of mexico and added a fourth cryogenic processing train and a billion cubic feet per day dehydration plant to our opal gas processing facility 
a third party funded and owns the fourth cryogenic train mentioned above 
the deepwater project contributed to segment profit in while both opal expansions will begin contributing in while strengthening our positions in these 
table of contents growth areas  we also continued to rationalize assets by completing sales of various non core assets 
the following is a list of assets sold during wholesale propane business  which represents the most significant portion of our ngl trading activities  and includes certain supply contracts and seven propane distribution terminals fourth quarter 
dry trail gas processing plant located in texas county  oklahoma fourth quarter 
west stoddart gas processing facility and the fractionation  storage  and distribution system at our redwater  alberta plant in western canada third quarter 
ownership interest in the following investments percent interest in rio grande pipeline second quarter  percent interest in the west texas pipeline third quarter  percent interest in wilprise pipeline fourth quarter  and percent interest in tri states ngl pipeline fourth quarter 
outlook for the following factors could impact our business in and beyond continued growth in the deepwater areas of the gulf of mexico is expected to contribute to  and become a larger component of  our future segment revenues and segment profit 
these additional fee based revenues will lower our relative exposure to commodity price risks 
gas processing margins may not be as favorable as those realized in and although wyoming natural gas prices are historically below natural gas prices in other domestic markets  the magnitude of this basis differential may be less in the near future 
midstream realized additional product gains related to its gas gathering systems in we do not consider these gains to be recurring in nature 
in  our gulf coast gas processing plants earned additional fee revenues derived from temporary processing agreements contracted in response to gas merchantability orders from pipeline operators requiring producers gas to be processed to achieve pipeline quality standards 
these contracts may terminate if processing economics in this region were to significantly improve 
we continue to evaluate and pursue the sale of various assets  including the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary gulf liquids new river llc gulf liquids currently reported as discontinued operations 
we also intend to sell certain canadian assets in the completion of asset sales may have the effect of lowering revenues and or segment profit in the periods following the sales 
the sale of our wholesale propane business mentioned above will reduce revenues and expenses  but should not have a material effect on our segment profit 
additional fee based revenues from our new deepwater assets are expected to mitigate segment profit decline resulting from certain asset sales 
a recent ferc energy affiliate ruling will impact our operation of certain regulated gas gathering assets owned by our affiliate transco 
as a result certain revenues and net profits may shift from our midstream segment to our gas pipelines segment 
year over year operating results in august  we completed the sale of percent of mapletree llc and percent of e oaktree  llc to enterprise products partners lp mapletree owned all of mid america pipeline  a  mile natural gas liquids pipeline system 
e oaktree owned percent of the seminole pipeline  a  mile natural gas liquids pipeline system 
the gains on the sale of these businesses and the related results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations 

table of contents pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles  we have classified the operations of gulf liquids  west stoddart and redwater as discontinued operations 
all prior periods reflect this reclassification 
years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit loss domestic gathering processing venezuela canada other total beginning in the third quarter of  our management discussion and analysis of operating results was reorganized into major asset groups to provide additional clarity 
the discussion comparing and results was not completed using the same asset groupings 
vs 
revenues increased billion primarily as a result of adopting eitf  which changed how we report natural gas liquids trading activities 
the costs of such activities are no longer reported as reductions in revenues 
eitf does not require restatement of prior year amounts 
in addition to this effect  our revenues increased million primarily due to higher natural gas liquids ngl revenues at our gas processing plants as a result of moderate market price increases  partially offset by lower ngl production volumes 
additional fee revenues associated with newly constructed deepwater assets and higher olefins sales also contributed to the revenue increase 
costs and operating expenses also increased billion primarily due to the adoption of eitf as discussed in the previous paragraph 
in addition to this effect  costs and expenses increased million  of which million is attributable to rising market prices for natural gas used to replace the heating value of ngls extracted at our gas processing facilities 
feedstock purchases for the olefins facilities increased million due to higher ngl and gas prices as well as higher purchase volumes 
segment profit increased million and reflects impairment charges of million in and million in both impairment charges related to certain canadian assets 
the remaining million increase is largely attributable to higher deepwater and other gulf coast fee revenues partially offset by unfavorable results in our canadian and gulf olefins operations 
segment profit benefited from increased processing margins in both and due to rising ngl prices coupled with depressed natural gas prices in the wyoming area 
in contrast  canadian and gulf olefins production margins suffered as market prices for ethane and propane feedstocks increased more than those for the olefins produced at these facilities  which lowered operating results 
in addition  gains on asset and investment sales  reduced selling  general and administrative expenses  and gathering system net gains are offset by lower partnership earnings and higher depreciation expense 
a more detailed analysis of segment profit of our various operations is presented below domestic gathering processing the million increase in domestic gathering and processing segment profit includes an million increase in the gulf coast region  partially offset by a million decline in the west region 
the gulf coast region s million improvement is largely attributable to million of incremental segment profit associated with new infrastructure in the deepwater area of the gulf of mexico 
the canyon station production platform  seahawk gas gathering pipeline  and banjo oil transportation system were placed into service during the latter half of and each contributed to midstream s segment profit 
the remaining gulf coast gathering and processing assets provided approximately million in additional net revenues  
table of contents primarily from million in higher processing margins and million in higher fee based revenues 
a portion of this increase relates to the temporary processing agreements which allow producers gas to be processed to achieve pipeline quality standards 
also  the regulated gas gathering system recorded an additional million in higher gathering revenues attributed to additional volumes originating from new deepwater production 
the west region s million segment profit decline reflects the absence of million in operating profit associated with the kansas hugoton gathering system sold in august although segment profit is comparable to  the west region s segment results were impacted by several offsetting factors discussed below gas processing margins declined million compared to margins experienced in throughout and the first quarter of  rising ngl prices and depressed wyoming natural gas prices yielded very favorable processing margins 
wyoming natural gas prices rebounded at the end of the first quarter as the completion of the kern river pipeline system added transportation capacity relieving downward price pressure 
margins recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter as wyoming gas prices lagged behind the increases in other energy commodities 
gathering and processing fee revenues declined million primarily due to fewer customers electing the fee based billing option of processing contracts 
non reimbursed fuel expenses declined million  largely attributed to favorable adjustments in the annual fuel reimbursement rates 
this favorable variance is not likely to continue in we realized million in non recurring net product gains related to our gas gathering system 
these gains represent less than one third of one percent of total gas gathered and are within industry standards 
historically our gathering system realizes net gains and losses  and therefore  we do not consider these gains to be recurring in nature 
depreciation expense was million higher in large part due to additional investments in the west 
venezuela segment profit for our venezuelan assets remained virtually unchanged 
higher compression rates in and the currency exchange loss resulted in million higher profits at the pigap gas compression facility 
these higher profits were partially offset by a million decrease in the el furrial operating margins attributed to plant downtime caused by a fire that occurred in the first quarter of also offsetting the increase in pigap operating profit is a million decline resulting from the termination of the jose terminal operations contract in december our venezuelan assets were constructed and are currently operated for the exclusive benefit of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa  the state owned petroleum corporation of venezuela 
the venezuelan economic and political environment can be volatile  but has not significantly impacted the operations and cash flows of our facilities 
effective february   the venezuelan government revalued the fixed exchange rate for their local currency from  bolivars to the dollar to  bolivars to the dollar 
this effect of this currency devaluation will be recorded in the first quarter of but should not have a significant impact on our first quarter segment profit 
canada the million increase in segment profit for our canadian assets reflects the difference in impairment charges of million in and million in the charge relates to the empress v and empress ii liquids extraction facilities  the charge related to the same facilities as well as the redwater fort mcmurray olefins assets 
the remaining million decline is primarily attributable to declining processing margins and higher operating expenses 
segment profit at our canadian gas processing plants and olefins facility declined million primarily due to gas prices increasing at a greater rate than ngl prices and higher operating expenses related to the redwater fort mcmurray olefins facility that became operational in april in addition  currency transaction losses were million higher in due to the decline of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar 

table of contents other the million decline in segment profit for midstream s other operations is attributed to lower domestic olefins margins and unfavorable partnership earnings  partially offset by the gain on sale of our wholesale propane operations 
segment profit for our domestic olefins group declined million primarily as a result of reduced olefins fractionation margins as the price of ethane and propane feedstock increased more than the price of olefins products 
higher maintenance expenses also contributed to the decline in segment profit 
olefins production margins continue to be impacted by weak consumer demand for products produced by petrochemical facilities 
our earnings from partially owned domestic assets accounted for using the equity method declined million largely due to million in prior period accounting adjustments recorded on the discovery partnership  the sale of other investments that generated positive earnings in and million of impairment charges associated with the aux sable partnership investment 
these unfavorable results were partially offset by net gains totaling approximately million from the sale of our interests in the west texas  rio grande  wilprise  and tri states liquids pipeline partnerships 
segment profit for our trading  fractionation  and storage group increased million primarily due to a million gain on the fourth quarter sale of our wholesale propane business consisting of certain supply contracts and seven propane distribution terminals 
our ngl trading operations activities were substantially curtailed in  resulting in million lower selling  general  and administrative costs partially offset by million in lower net trading revenues 
in addition  ngl service fees declined million due to the sale of several ngl terminals in vs 
our revenues decreased million as a result of a million increase in domestic gathering  processing  transportation and liquid product sales revenues  a million increase in venezuelan revenues  a million decrease in canadian revenues  and a million decline in domestic petrochemical and trading revenues 
the million increase in domestic gathering  processing  transportation  storage  fractionation and liquid product sales revenues resulted from a million increase in liquid sales and a million increase in transportation revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in gathering revenues primarily due to the third quarter sale of the kansas hugoton gathering system  a million decrease in storage revenues and a million decrease in fractionation revenues 
the increase in liquid sales reflects a million increase in gulf coast liquid sales resulting primarily from higher production at existing processing facilities  and the september completion of a new processing facility that processes natural gas gathered from deepwater projects off the coast of texas 
the increase in gulf coast liquid sales was partially offset by a million decline in liquid sales in the west  primarily caused by a decline in average liquid sales prices 
the million increase in transportation revenues reflects the results of a new deepwater oil and gas transportation system which was completely operational by mid year the million decline in petrochemicals and trading revenues is due largely to a september change in the reporting of certain petrochemical and liquid product trading transactions from a gross revenue basis to a net revenue basis combined with lower natural gas liquid trading margins 
the million increase in venezuelan revenues reflects a full year of results from a new gas compression facility that began operations in august 
table of contents the decrease in canadian revenues primarily results from a million decrease in processing revenues and a million decrease in liquid sales from processing activities 
the decrease in processing revenue reflects lower processing rates under cost of service agreements as a result of lower natural gas shrink prices 
the decrease in liquid sales from processing activities reflects lower average liquid sales prices 
costs and operating expenses decreased million  or percent  primarily reflecting a decline in fuel and product shrink costs at the domestic and canadian processing facilities of million and million  respectively 
these decreases reflect lower average natural gas prices in canada and wyoming  offset by higher volumes and prices in the gulf coast 
the lower average gas prices in wyoming during reflect a favorable differential between gas prices in wyoming and the gulf as a result of limited transportation capacity from wyoming to other markets 
this favorable basis differential had the effect of lower shrink costs and increasing liquid sales margins from wyoming processing plants and is not expected to continue once take away transportation capacity within this region has been expanded 
costs and operating expenses also reflect a million decline in petrochemical and trading costs resulting from the september change in reporting certain product trading classifications 
these decreases are partially offset by million higher transportation  fractionation  and marketing costs 
operations and maintenance expenses were relatively unchanged on a segment basis 
a million decline in costs in the west primarily  resulting from lower maintenance spending  was offset by a corresponding increase in the gulf  canada and venezuela 
the increase in these areas was largely associated with higher maintenance costs resulting from the new venezuelan gas compression facility  canadian olefins facility and new deepwater offshore operations 
selling  general and administrative costs were relatively unchanged on a segment basis 
other income expense net within segment costs and expense for includes a million impairment associated with the canadian processing  extraction and olefin extraction assets see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and a million impairment associated with the sale of the kansas hugoton gathering system in the third quarter 
reflected in are million of impairments associated with certain south texas non regulated gathering and processing assets see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment profit increased million from this increase reflects a million increase in domestic operations  a million increase in venezuelan operations and a million decrease in canadian operations 
domestic segment profit reflects a million increase in liquid sales margins resulting from the low fuel and shrink costs in the west reflecting the wide basis differential for natural gas prices in wyoming 
domestic segment profit also increased million due to income from equity investments primarily related to significant improvements in the operations of discovery pipeline following new supply connections that resulted in higher transportation and liquid volumes 
domestic segment profit was also impacted by a million increase in profits from an increase in deepwater operations 
the decrease in segment profit from canadian operations primarily relates to the million impairment discussed above 
segment profit from venezuelan operations reflects an increase resulting from a full year of results following the completion of a new gas compression facility in august other overview of during  we began reporting the petroleum services segment within other as a result of a significant portion of the petroleum services assets being reflected as discontinued operations 
other now includes corporate operations  certain international activities and the remaining continuing operations of petroleum services 

table of contents outlook for during february  we were a party to a recapitalization plan completed by longhorn partners pipeline  lp longhorn 
as a result of this plan  we sold a portion of our equity investment in longhorn for million  received million in repayment of a portion of our advances to longhorn and converted the remaining advances  including accrued interest  into preferred equity interests in longhorn 
these preferred equity interests are subordinate to the preferred interests held by the new investors 
no gain or loss was recognized on this transaction 
year over year operating results years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit loss vs 
other segment loss for includes a million impairment related to our investment in longhorn 
the impairment resulted from our assessment that indicated there had been an other than temporary decline in the fair value of this investment 
longhorn equity earnings increased million during from a loss of million in the segment profit includes a million gain on the sale of our percent ownership interest in the lithuanian operations partially offset by a million equity loss for those operations 
vs 
the million  or percent  decrease in revenues is due primarily to million lower convenience store revenues after the sale in may of convenience stores 
other segment profit in includes a million gain from the september sale of our percent ownership interest in the lithuanian refinery  pipeline and terminal complex and a million decrease in equity losses from the lithuanian operations for the period 
we received proceeds of approximately million from the sale of this investment 
in addition  we sold our million note receivable from the lithuanian operations at face value 
equity losses related to longhorn increased million from to included in segment profit is a million gain on the sale of convenience stores 

table of contents energy trading activities as of december   we carried energy and energy related contracts on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we held all of these energy and energy related contracts for trading purposes 
as of december   we reported net assets of approximately  million related to the fair value of energy risk management and trading contracts 
of this value  approximately  million pertained to non derivative energy contracts  which were reflected at fair value under eitf issue no 
on october  in issue no 
 the eitf rescinded issue no 
with the adoption of eitf on january   we reversed this non derivative fair value through a cumulative adjustment from a change in accounting principle 
these contracts are now accounted for under the accrual method 
effective january   only energy contracts meeting the definition of a derivative are reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
fair value of trading derivatives consistent with our announcement to exit the merchant power and generation business  in we assessed which derivative contracts we held for trading purposes and which we held for non trading purposes 
we consider trading derivatives to be those held to provide price risk management services to third party customers 
the chart below reflects the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes as of december  we have presented the fair value of assets and liabilities by period in which they are expected to be realized 
to be to be to be to be realized in realized in realized in realized in months months months months total fair year years years years value millions as the table above illustrates  we are not materially engaged in trading activities 
however  we hold a substantial portfolio of non trading derivative contracts 
non trading derivative contracts are those that hedge or could possibly hedge power s long term structured contract positions and the activities of our other segments on an economic basis 
certain of these economic hedges have not been designated as or do not qualify as sfas no 
hedges 
as such  changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts are reflected in earnings 
we also hold certain derivative contracts  which do qualify as sfas no 
cash flow hedges  which primarily hedge exploration production s forecasted natural gas sales 
as of december   the fair value of these non trading derivative contracts was a net asset of million 
methods of estimating fair value most of the derivatives we hold settle in active periods and markets in which quoted market prices are available 
quoted market prices in active markets are readily available for valuing forward contracts  futures contracts  swap agreements and purchase and sales transactions in the commodity and capital markets in which we transact 
while an active market may not exist for the entire period  quoted prices can generally be obtained for the following natural gas through  power through  crude and refined products through  natural gas liquids through  and interest rates through these prices reflect the economic and regulatory conditions that currently exist in the marketplace and are subject to change in the near term due to changes in market conditions 
the availability of quoted market prices in active markets varies between periods and commodities based upon changes in market conditions 

table of contents the ability to obtain quoted market prices also varies greatly from region to region 
the time periods noted above are an estimation of aggregate liquidity 
we use prices of current transactions to further validate price estimates 
however  the decline in overall market liquidity since has limited our ability to validate prices 
we estimate energy commodity prices in illiquid periods by incorporating information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets  quoted prices in less active markets  and other market fundamental analysis 
due to the adoption of eitf  modeling and other valuation techniques are not used significantly in determining the fair value of our derivatives 
such techniques were primarily used in previous years for valuing non derivative contracts  which are no longer reported at fair value  such as transportation  storage  full requirements  load serving  transmission and power tolling contracts see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
counterparty credit considerations we include an assessment of the risk of counterparty non performance in our estimate of fair value for all contracts 
such assessment considers the credit rating of each counterparty as represented by public rating agencies such as standard poor s and moody s investors service  the inherent default probabilities within these ratings  the regulatory environment that the contract is subject to and the terms of each individual contract 
risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows 
we continually assess this risk 
we have credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if necessary 
at december   we held collateral support of million 
we also enter into netting agreements to mitigate counterparty performance and credit risk 
in and  we closed out various trading positions 
during  we did not incur any significant losses due to recent counterparty bankruptcy filings 
the gross credit exposure from our derivative contracts as of december  is summarized below 
investment counterparty type grade a total millions gas and electric utilities energy marketers and traders financial institutions other credit reserves gross credit exposure from derivatives b 
table of contents we assess our credit exposure on a net basis 
the net credit exposure from our derivatives as of december  is summarized below 
investment counterparty type grade a total millions gas and electric utilities energy marketers and traders financial institutions other credit reserves net credit exposure from derivatives b a we determine investment grade primarily using publicly available credit ratings 
we included counterparties with a minimum standard poor s rating of bbb or moody s investors service rating of baa in investment grade 
we also classify counterparties that have provided sufficient collateral  such as cash  standby letters of credit  adequate parent company guarantees  and property interests  as investment grade 
b one counterparty within the california power market represents more than ten percent of the derivative assets and is included in investment grade 
standard poor s and moody s investors service do not currently rate this counterparty 
we included this counterparty in the investment grade column based upon contractual credit requirements in the event of assignment or substitution of a new obligation for the existing one 
financial condition and liquidity liquidity overview of entering  we faced significant liquidity challenges with sizeable maturing debt obligations and limited financial flexibility due in part to covenants arising from short term financings 
our plan to address these issues  announced in february  required immediate execution of significant levels of asset sales to meet maturing obligations in excess of billion by mid year 
through june  we were successful in generating approximately billion of net proceeds from the sale of assets 
with sufficient liquidity in hand  we prepaid the rmt note totaling billion 
during the same period  we enhanced overall liquidity through the following actions obtained a new million revolving and letter of credit facility that is collateralized by cash and or government securities  but allows operation with minimal covenants  none of which contain financial ratios  issued million of percent senior unsecured notes due  which provided added liquidity in advance of remaining asset sales and flexibility to use funds to retire the billion senior unsecured percent notes maturing in march  redeemed the million percent cumulative convertible preferred shares through the issuance of million of percent junior subordinated convertible debentures  through our rmt subsidiary  obtained a new million term loan at market rates and collateralized by rmt assets  the proceeds of which were used together with other funds to repay the rmt note  and 
table of contents through our northwest pipeline subsidiary  issued million of percent senior unsecured notes due  which enabled northwest pipeline to fund capital expenditures without borrowing cash from our parent company 
during the fourth quarter of  we continued the execution of our plan to reduce debt with available funds by tendering for and retiring debt of nearly billion 
of this total  million was comprised of the percent notes due march  leaving million outstanding 
during  we generated net cash proceeds from asset sales of approximately billion 
we expect to realize approximately million from additional asset sales in the remaining expected asset sales include our alaska refinery and related operations  which are currently under contract for sale  and certain midstream assets 
our cash flow from operations of million funded a large portion of our capital spending requirements for the year 
at december   we have available unrestricted cash on hand of approximately billion 
sources of liquidity our liquidity is derived from both internal and external sources 
certain of those sources are available to us at the parent level and others are available to certain of our subsidiaries 
at december   we have the following sources of liquidity cash equivalent investments at the corporate level of billion as compared to billion at december  cash and cash equivalent investments of various international and domestic entities of million  as compared to million at december  at december   we have capacity of million available under our current revolving and letter of credit facility 
in june  we entered into this revolving and letter of credit facility which is used primarily for issuing letters of credit and must be collateralized at percent of the level utilized see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed below in the outlook for section  we intend to replace this facility in with facilities that do not require cash collateralization 
in contrast  at december  we had a combined million available under the previous revolver and letter of credit facilities 
in addition to these sources of liquidity described above  we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that authorizes us to issue an additional billion of a variety of debt and equity securities 
however  the ability to utilize this shelf registration for debt securities is restricted by certain covenants associated with our million percent senior unsecured notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiaries northwest pipeline and transco have outstanding registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
as of december   approximately million of shelf availability remains under these registration statements 
however  the ability to utilize these registration statements is restricted by certain covenants associated with our million percent senior unsecured notes 
interest rates  market conditions  and industry conditions will affect amounts raised  if any  in the capital markets 
on march   northwest pipeline completed an offering of million of percent senior notes due these notes contain covenants similar to those of the million percent senior unsecured notes discussed above 
the million of shelf availability mentioned above was not utilized for this offering 
during  we supplied liquidity needs with cash generated from the sale of assets in  we generated approximately billion in net proceeds from asset sales and expect to realize approximately million from additional asset sales in 
table of contents cash generated from operations in  we generated million in cash flow from continuing operations and expect to generate to billion in we estimate approximately million to million for capital and investment expenditures 
we expect to fund capital and investment expenditures  debt payments and working capital requirements through cash and cash equivalent investments on hand  cash generated from operations  and cash generated from the sale of assets 
outlook for in  we expect to make significant additional progress towards debt reduction while maintaining appropriate levels of cash and other forms of liquidity 
to manage our operations and meet unforeseen or extraordinary calls on cash  we expect to maintain cash and or liquidity levels of at least billion 
while access to the capital markets continues to improve  one of our indentures has a covenant that restricts our ability to issue new debt  with minimal exceptions  until a certain fixed charge coverage ratio is achieved 
we expect to satisfy this requirement by the end of the covenant does not prohibit us from replacing our existing revolving and letter of credit facility with new facilities 
several of our indentures contain covenants restricting our ability to grant liens securing debt  but such covenants all contain significant exceptions allowing us to incur secured debt without granting similar liens to the holders of notes under those indentures 
in determining the appropriate level of liquidity  we have considered the potential impact of significant swings in commodity prices  contract margin requirements  unplanned calls on capital spending and the need for a reserve for near term scheduled debt payments 
during  we expect to reduce long term debt  including scheduled maturities of billion  based on the following assumptions generation of approximately million from additional asset sales  generation of cash flow from operations by our businesses in excess of capital spending levels  replacement of our revolving and letter of credit facility with facilities that do not require cash collateralization  and utilization of available cash on hand in excess of minimum liquidity levels 
successful execution of this plan does not require us to to incur new debt 
potential risks associated with achieving this objective include lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations 
to mitigate this exposure  exploration production has hedged the price of natural gas for approximately percent of its expected production 
power estimates that it has hedged revenues  of varying degrees of certainty  covering approximately percent of its fixed demand obligations through delays in asset sales or lower than expected proceeds 
approximately one third of the remaining asset sales are currently under contract and expected to close during the first quarter 
if these sales do not close  we will not be precluded from meeting our operating commitments 
sensitivity of margin requirements associated with our marginable commodity contracts 
as of february  we estimate our exposure to additional margin requirements over the next days to be as much as million 
exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and litigation issues arising from the power business and the ongoing defense of certain shareholder litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
ability to replace our revolver and letter of credit facility on satisfactory terms 

table of contents based on our available cash on hand and expected cash flows from operations  we believe we have  or have access to  the financial resources and liquidity necessary to meet future cash requirements and maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to reasonably protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of funds 
credit ratings during  our credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade and remained below investment grade throughout as a result  power s participation in energy risk management and trading activities requires alternate credit support under certain agreements 
in addition  we are required to fund margin requirements pursuant to industry standard derivative agreements with cash  letters of credit or other negotiable instruments 
currently  we are effectively required to post margins of percent or more on forward contracts in a loss position 
future liquidity requirements relating to these instruments will be based on changes in their value resulting from changes in factors such as price and volatility 
as part of the plan announced in february of  we established a goal of returning to investment grade status 
while reduction of debt is viewed as a key contributor towards this goal  certain of the key credit rating agencies have imputed the financial commitments associated with our long term tolling agreements within the power business as debt 
if we are unable to achieve our goal of exiting the power business and or the elimination of these commitments  receiving an investment grade rating may be further delayed 
off balance sheet financing arrangements and guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties at december   we had operating lease agreements with special purpose entities spe s relating to certain of our travel center stores included in discontinued operations  offshore oil and gas pipelines and an onshore gas processing plant 
as a result of changes to the leases in conjunction with the secured financing facilities completed in july  they no longer qualified for operating lease treatment 
the operating leases for the offshore oil and gas pipelines and onshore gas processing plant were recorded as capital leases within long term debt at that time and were repaid in may the travel center lease was reported in liabilities of discontinued operations and was repaid in march pursuant to the travel centers sale 
we had agreements to sell  on an ongoing basis  certain of our accounts receivable to qualified special purpose entities 
on july   these agreements expired and were not renewed 
in may  we provided a guarantee of approximately million towards project financing of energy assets owned and operated by discovery producer services llc discovery in which we own a percent interest 
this obligation was not consolidated in our balance sheet as we account for our interest under the equity method of accounting 
the guarantee was scheduled to expire at the end of however  in december  we made an additional million investment in discovery which was used to fully repay maturing debt satisfying the guarantee obligation 
all owners contributed amounts equal to their ownership percentage 
see the investing activities section for discussion of additional investment 
we have provided guarantees in the event of nonpayment by wiltel on certain of its lease performance obligations that extend through and have a maximum potential exposure of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
our exposure declines systematically throughout the remaining lease terms 
the recorded carrying value of these guarantees was million and million at december  and respectively 
in addition to these guarantees  we have issued guarantees and other similar arrangements with off balance sheet risk as discussed under guarantees in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating activities the increase in cash flow from operations from levels is primarily due to the following improvement in income loss from continuing operations by million  the absence of million in payment of guarantees and payment obligations related to wiltel  
table of contents the reduction of margin funding requirements of million  and the increase in cash flow due to changes in accounts and notes receivable of million 
the increase in income loss from continuing operations is reflective of the overall improvement in the performance of our operating units 
however  the noted improvement in income loss from continuing operations had a lesser impact on cash flow from operations because income loss from continuing operations in included higher non cash expenses of million for losses on property and other assets and the million provision for uncollectible accounts from wiltel 
the improvement in margin funding requirements is a result of our decreased activity in the power business 
we expect a continued decrease in margin funding requirements in as we continue to manage our current positions to reduce risk and exit other positions  which reduces our overall activity 
the increase in operating cash flow related to decreased accounts receivable is a reflection of the continued decrease in activity in the power business in cash flow from operations for is expected to be sufficient to fund the projected capital expenditures of million to million 
in march  wiltel exercised its option to purchase certain network assets under the adp transaction for which we had previously provided a guarantee 
on march   as guarantor under the agreement  we paid million related to wiltel s purchase of these network assets 
in  we recorded in continuing operations additional pre tax charges of million related to the settlement of these receivables and claims 
in  we had recorded a million charge related to estimated recovery of amounts from wiltel see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in net income and other increases in cash flows from operations were offset by a million decrease in derivative and energy risk management and trading net assets and liabilities  and a million payment on deferred set up fee and fixed rate interest on the rmt note payable 
the decrease in funds associated with derivative and energy risk management and trading assets and liabilities during is a result of the decline in the activity of the power business 
as we continue to reduce our activity in the power business  the cash requirements tied to working capital and margin deposits will continue to decrease 
during  we recorded approximately million in provisions for losses on property and other assets and a net gain on disposition of assets of see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accrual for fixed rate interest included in the rmt note on the consolidated statement of cash flows represents the quarterly non cash reclassification of the deferred fixed rate interest from an accrued liability to the rmt note 
the amortization of deferred set up fee and fixed rate interest on the rmt note relates to amounts recognized in the income statement as interest expense  which were not payable until maturity 
the rmt note was repaid in may see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financing activities during  we made significant progress in executing our business plan 
we retired billion in debt  redeemed million in preferred stock  and issued billion in debt at more favorable market rates 
in  we plan to further reduce debt with funding from available cash on hand  cash from asset sales  operating cash flow after capital expenditures  and the release of cash currently used as collateral 
as discussed in the outlook section  we plan to replace our existing revolver and letter of credit facility with new credit facilities that do not require cash collateralization

table of contents contractual obligations the table below summarizes the maturity dates of our contractual obligations by period 
thereafter total millions notes payable long term debt  including current portion principal interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations fuel conversion and other service contracts other other long term liabilities  including current portion physical financial derivatives other total includes billion of percent notes payable in which are subject to remarketing in feline pacs 
these feline pacs include equity forward contracts attached which require the holder to purchase shares of our common stock in if the remarketing is unsuccessful and a second remarketing in is also unsuccessful  then we could exercise our right to foreclose on the notes in order to satisfy the obligation of the holders of the equity forward contracts requiring the holder to purchase our common stock 
this would be a non cash transaction 
total operating lease payments include million related to discontinued operations 
power has entered into certain contracts giving us the right to receive fuel conversion services as well as certain other services associated with electric generation facilities that are currently in operation throughout the continental united states 
includes million for a crude purchase contract with the state of alaska which expires in september it is anticipated that the expected sale of the alaska refinery in the first quarter of will result in the cancellation of our obligations under this contract 
includes one year of annual payments totaling million for contracts with indefinite termination dates 
although the amounts presented represent expected cash outflows  a portion of those obligations have previously been paid in accordance with third party margining agreements 
as of december   we have paid million in margins  adequate assurance  and prepays related to the obligations included in this disclosure 
in addition  expected offsetting cash inflows resulting from product sales or net positive settlements are not reflected in these amounts 
the offsetting expected cash inflows as of december  are billion 
in addition  the obligations for physical and financial derivatives are based on market information as of december  because market information changes daily and has the potential to be volatile  significant changes to the values in this category may occur 
effects of inflation our cost increases in recent years have benefited from relatively low inflation rates during that time 
approximately percent of our gross property  plant and equipment is at gas pipeline and approximately percent is at other operating units 
gas pipeline is subject to regulation  which limits recovery to historical 
table of contents cost 
while amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current ferc practices  we anticipate being allowed to recover and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace existing assets 
cost based regulation  along with competition and other market factors  may limit our ability to recover such increased costs 
for the other operating units  operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by specific price changes in oil and natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general inflation 
crude  refined product  natural gas  natural gas liquids and power prices are particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or the market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future 
environmental we are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages involving assessment studies  cleanup operations and or remedial processes at certain sites  some of which we currently do not own see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties  the us environmental protection agency epa  or other governmental authorities 
we are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others 
current estimates of the most likely costs of such cleanup activities are approximately million  all of which is accrued at december  we expect to seek recovery of approximately million of the accrued costs through future natural gas transmission rates 
the remainder of these costs will be funded from operations 
during  we paid approximately million for cleanup and or remediation and monitoring activities 
we expect to pay approximately million in for these activities 
estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies  preliminary results of studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations 
at december   certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield significantly different estimates of most likely costs 
therefore  the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount  type and extent of contamination discovered at these sites  the final cleanup standards mandated by the epa or other governmental authorities  and other factors 
we are subject to the federal clean air act and to the federal clean air act amendments of which require the epa to issue new regulations 
we are also subject to regulation at the state and local level 
in september  the epa promulgated rules designed to mitigate the migration of ground level ozone in certain states 
we anticipate that during  the epa will promulgate additional rules regarding hazardous air pollutants 
we estimate that capital expenditures necessary to install emission control devices on our transco system over the next five years to comply with rules will be between million and million 
the actual costs incurred will depend on the final implementation plans developed by each state to comply with these regulations 
we consider these costs on our transco system associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and  therefore  recoverable through its rates 
in december  standards promulgated by the epa for tailpipe emissions and the content of sulfur in gasoline were announced 
our estimation is that capital expenditures necessary to bring our refinery into compliance over the next five years will be approximately million 
we anticipate that  if the sale of the refinery is completed see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the purchaser would be responsible for these compliance expenditures 
the actual costs incurred will depend on the final implementation plans 
on july   the epa issued an information request asking for information on oil releases and discharges in any amount from our pipelines  pipeline systems  and pipeline facilities used in the movement of oil or petroleum products  during the period july  through july  in november  we furnished our response 
this matter has not become an enforcement proceeding 
on march   the department of justice doj invited the new owner of the pipeline to enter into negotiations regarding alleged violations of the clean water act and to sign a tolling agreement 
no penalty has been assessed by the epa  however  the doj stated in its letter that the maximum possible penalties were approximately million for the alleged violations 
it is anticipated that by providing additional clarification and through negotiations with the epa and doj  that any proposed penalty will be reduced 
we have indemnity obligations to the new owner related to this matter 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio and energy trading and non trading portfolios 
a significant portion of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
we have historically utilized interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts to further mitigate risk 
currently  we do not have outstanding swaps or forward contracts related to our debt portfolio 
the maturity of our long term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected life of our operating assets 
we also have interest rate risk in long dated energy contracts included in our energy trading and non trading portfolios 
the value of these transactions can fluctuate daily based on movements in the underlying interest rates 
we use floating to fixed interest rate swaps  bond futures and eurodollar contracts to manage this variable rate exposure 
at december   the notional amount of the outstanding contracts included in our energy trading and non trading portfolios was million 
the tables below provide information as of december  and  about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
long term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows  net of discount premium  and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

the variable rate portion related to these notes is based on the eurodollar rate  
table of contents plus percent per annum 
an additional percent fixed rate  compounded quarterly  accrues to the rmt note payable 
weighted average interest rate through is libor plus an applicable margin ranging from percent to percent  except million at eurodollar plus percent  weighted average interest rate in is eurodollar plus percent 
the marketable securities mature in the balance sheet classification is determined based on the expected term of the underlying collateral requirement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  power  crude oil  refined products and natural gas liquids 
we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy related assets  our long term energy related contracts and our proprietary trading activities 
we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives 
the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in energy commodity market prices  the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted  and changes in interest rates 
we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value at risk methodology to estimate the potential one day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios 
value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios 
the value at risk model assumes that  as a result of changes in commodity prices  there is a percent probability that the one day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk 
the value at risk model uses historical simulations to estimate hypothetical movements in future market prices 
in these simulations  we assume normal market conditions and historical market prices 
in applying the value at risk methodology  we do not consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one day holding period to execute 
while a one day holding period has historically been the industry standard  a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints 
we segregated our derivative contracts into trading and non trading contracts  as defined in the following paragraphs 
we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories 
derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales under sfas no 
and non derivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk 
trading at december   our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into to provide price risk management services to third party customers 
only contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
at december   both derivatives and non derivative energy related contracts were carried at fair value on the balance sheet in accordance with eitf with the adoption of eitf on january   we discontinued reporting non derivative contracts at fair value 
in addition  during the second quarter of  consistent with our intention to exit the merchant energy trading business  we reassessed which contracts were considered trading and which were hedges or potential hedges of our long dated power business 
this resulted in the reclassification of certain derivative contracts related to our power segment to the non trading portfolio during the value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the value at risk for contracts held at december   has been restated to exclude the non derivative contracts that are no longer carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
the trading portfolio value at risk at december   includes all the derivative contracts  except for those designated as sfas no 
hedges  from our power segment and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream segment  as those contracts were all considered trading at that time 
during the year ended december   our value at risk for contracts considered trading ranged from a high of million to a low of million 

table of contents non trading our non trading portfolio consists of contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas liquids purchases natural gas liquids sales natural gas purchases electricity purchases power natural gas purchases electricity purchases electricity sales the value at risk for contracts held for non trading purposes was million at december  and million at december  during the year ended december   our value at risk for contracts considered non trading ranged from a high of million to a low of million 
as discussed in the trading section above  we reassessed which contracts were considered trading and which contracts were considered non trading during the second quarter of certain of these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
we did not consider the underlying commodity positions to which the cash flow hedges relate in our value at risk model 
therefore  value at risk does not represent economic losses that could occur on a total non trading portfolio that includes the underlying commodity positions 
foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions in foreign countries 
international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled million and million at december   and  respectively 
these investments are primarily in non publicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value  therefore  the fair value of these investments is deemed to approximate their carrying amount 
we continue to believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments 
if a percent change occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these investments against the us dollar  the fair value of these investments at december   could change by approximately million assuming a direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the value of the investments 
net assets of consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency are located primarily in canada and approximate percent of our net assets at december  these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies 
however  these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position  due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of re measuring the local functional currency into the us dollar 
as an example  a percent change in the respective functional currencies against the us dollar could have changed stockholders equity by approximately million at december  we historically have not utilized derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies with the exception of a canadian dollar denominated note receivable see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  we monitor currency fluctuations and could potentially use derivative financial instruments or employ other investment alternatives if cash flows or investment returns so warrant
