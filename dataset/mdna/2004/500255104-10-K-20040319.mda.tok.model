outlook in looking at fiscal  the company s preliminary earnings guidance is based upon a low single digit comparable store sales increase 
with the adjustments the company is making to the inventory levels and content  the company would expect that the gross margin rate would return to historical levels of approximately of net sales

contractual obligations the company has aggregate contractual obligations of  million related to debt repayments  capital leases and operating leases as follows fiscal year thereafter total in thousands long term debt capital leases a operating leases total a annual commitments on capital leases are net of interest 
the company has entered into future capital lease commitments for land and buildings that total approximately million at january   which have not been recorded as the related buildings are under construction 
the company also has outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit that total approximately million at january  if certain conditions were met under these arrangements  the company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  the company does not expect to make any significant payments 
therefore  they have been excluded from the preceding table 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has not provided any financial guarantees as of january  all purchase obligations are cancelable and therefore are not included in the above table 
the company has not created  and is not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating the company s business 
the company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect the company s liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the aging of accounts  historical write off experience and specific review for potential bad debts 
delinquent accounts are written off automatically after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
for all other accounts  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the accounts are past due and the anticipated future write offs based on historical experience 
factors that would cause this allowance to increase primarily relate to increased customer bankruptcies or other difficulties that make further collection unlikely 
conversely  improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease in the provision 
retail inventory method and inventory valuation the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in  first out lifo basis using the retail inventory method rim 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
the use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
based on a review of historical clearance markdowns  current business trends  expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories  an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes that the company s inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
vendor allowances the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the company s expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program 
vendor participation in the selling of merchandise will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  business and summary of accounting policies for fiscal changes 
insurance reserve estimates the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by its associates 
the company determines the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which the company operates could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
under its workers compensation and general liability insurance policies  the company retains the initial risk of  and  respectively  per occurrence 
impairment of assets and closed store reserves the company has a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights 
the related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to years 
the company reviews long lived assets held for use including favorable lease rights for impairment annually or whenever an event  such as decisions to close a store  indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company has historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves 
decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
if the store is leased  a reserve is set up for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income when the location is no longer in use 
a significant change in cash flows  market valuation  demand for real estate or other factors  could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge 
income taxes the company pays income taxes based on tax statutes  regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities

 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor applicable to fiscal years beginning after december  and is effective for contracts entered into after december  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on net earnings in fiscal year  as the company entered into substantially all of its fiscal vendor contracts prior to december  because substantially all new vendor contracts for new store advertising have been put in place for fiscal  the company will adopt the provisions of eitf and account for these allowances as a reduction of inventory and cost of merchandise sold 
this change in accounting will reduce fiscal year diluted earnings per share by approximately per diluted share with the majority of the impact on net earnings occurring during the first and third quarters of fiscal in conjunction with the company s new store openings and build in inventory 
this change in accounting will not impact the company s cash flow or the expected amount of contributions to be received from the company s vendors
