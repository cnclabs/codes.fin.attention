item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of regal and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries  regal cinemas  united artists  edwards  hoyts and regal cinemedia 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states as of january   with over million annual attendees for the fifty three week fiscal year ended january  regal cinemedia focuses exclusively on the expansion of ancillary businesses  such as advertising  and the creation of new complementary business lines that leverage our existing asset and customer bases 
we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale in our theatre operations and capitalize on regal cinemedia s ancillary revenue opportunities 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by on screen advertisements  rental of theatres for business meetings and other events by regal cinemedia  vendor marketing programs and electronic video games located adjacent to the lobbies of certain of our theatres 
film rental costs depend on the popularity of a film and the length of time since the film s release and generally decline as a percentage of admission revenues the longer a film is in exhibition 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs 
regal was created through a series of transactions during and anschutz acquired controlling equity interests in united artists our predecessor for accounting purposes upon the emergence from bankruptcy reorganization on march  of the united artists bankrupt entities as defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in the same manner  on september   anschutz acquired controlling equity interests in the edwards bankrupt entities as defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on january   anschutz acquired a controlling equity interest in regal cinemas  inc when the regal cinemas  inc bankrupt entities as defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements emerged from bankruptcy reorganization 
anschutz exchanged its controlling equity interest in regal cinemas  inc for a controlling equity interest in regal cinemas immediately thereafter 
in addition  regal cinemedia was formed in february to focus on the development of ancillary revenues 
regal acquired the controlling equity interests of united artists  edwards  regal cinemas and regal cinemedia through a series of transactions described in further detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on april   regal cinemas  inc acquired the remaining outstanding capital stock of edwards and  as a result  edwards became a wholly owned subsidiary of regal cinemas  inc on march   regal acquired hoyts 
the company s financial statements reflect the results of operations from the dates anschutz acquired its controlling equity interests in united artists  edwards and regal cinemas 
these controlling equity interests have been recorded in the company s financial statements at anschutz s combined historical cost basis 
the company s financial statements for the period ended january  the fiscal period reflect only the results of operations of united artists from march  approximately months and edwards from september  to december  approximately months 
the company s financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  the fiscal period include the results of operations of united artists from january  a full fiscal year less one week  edwards from december  a full fiscal year  and regal cinemas from january  approximately months

for a summary of industry trends as well as other risks and uncertainties relevant to the company  see business industry trends above and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors below 
results of operations the theatre exhibition industry fared better than expected against record box office results 
based on our results and our review of selected industry sources  we believe national box office revenues in calendar year approximated that of calendar year management believes that box office results benefited from increased average ticket prices per patron  offset by a decline in national attendance 
the increase in average ticket price per patron resulted from increases in ticket prices coupled with a favorable film product mix  which resulted in sales of a greater proportion of full price tickets 
although the film mix favorably impacted average ticket prices per patron  it had a negative impact on concession revenue per patron 
the fiscal film mix consisted of a higher proportion of r rated and pg rated films 
better than expected box office performance consistent with industry trends  the acquisition of hoyts  increases in regal cinemedia advertising and business meetings and events revenues  the impact of week fifty three and the other factors described below led to the increases in the company s total revenues  net income  earnings per diluted share and ebitda 
the additional week in fiscal is significant in that it was the week between christmas and new years day  which is a traditionally high attendance week for the company and the industry and accounted for approximately of the fiscal period total attendance 
total revenues for the fiscal period were  million  a increase compared to total revenues of  million for the fiscal period 
net income increased to million for the fiscal period compared to net income of million in the fiscal period 
earnings per diluted share increased to for the fiscal period compared to in the fiscal period 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization totaled million for the fiscal period  an increase of from the fiscal period and represented an ebitda margin of  an increase of basis points over the fiscal period 
excluding the effects of week fifty three and the results of hoyts  the fiscal period total revenues  net income  earnings per diluted share and ebitda would have increased over the fiscal period by   and  respectively 
a tabular reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and net income is provided below under results of operations ebitda 
during the fiscal period  the company made significant progress with its strategic initiatives during the fiscal period  we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal year  including the million extraordinary dividend paid in the third quarter of  totaled approximately million 
in november  we announced an increase to our quarterly class a and class b common stock dividend by to per share  which became effective for our first quarterly dividend  which was declared in february we acquired certain hoyts theatres in the second quarter of for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
during  hoyts contributed approximately million attendees or to our total attendance 
the acquisition of hoyts provides solid evidence of our commitment to creating growth opportunities with a prudent acquisition strategy 
in addition to the hoyts acquisition  which consisted of theatres representing screens  we opened theatres with screens and closed theaters with screens  ending the fiscal period with theaters and  screens 
for the fiscal period  we invested approximately million in capital expenditures to improve our theatre assets and strengthen our existing market position 
we continued to gain traction in our regal cinemedia business and finished the fiscal period ahead of our revenue  ebitda and ebitda margin targets 
we continued to expand our dcn and invested approximately million in capital expenditures during the fiscal period 
we continued to operate the company with a focus on increasing cash flow from operations and operating margins 
during the fiscal period  our cash flows from operating activities increased and we achieved a basis point improvement in our operating margins 
ebitda totaled approximately million  an increase of over the prior year 
our ebitda margins increased as we ended the fiscal period approximately basis points ahead of the fiscal period 
our focus on maximizing operating efficiencies through the integration of regal cinemas  united artists and edwards and the acquisition of hoyts  the growth of revenues in regal cinemedia and controlling expenses where possible contributed to the cash flow and operating margin expansion 
we remain optimistic regarding the film slate and share the view of a number of film studio executives who believe the industry is poised to benefit from another year of solid box office performance 
evidenced by the film studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of an extended film release calendar consisting of high profile releases such as the passion of the christ as well as a few key sequels  such as harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  shrek and spiderman as a result of the breadth of the anticipated film product  the company anticipates a slight increase in industry attendance for the calendar year as compared to the calendar year coupled with modest increases in ticket prices and concession revenues per patron 
we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisition opportunities 
with respect to capital expenditures  due in part to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect theatre capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and maintenance 
in addition  we are forecasting approximately to million of regal cinemedia capital expenditures 
we will continue to focus on a simple business strategy including continued evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities to selectively consolidate a fragmented industry  enhancement of attractive business opportunities through regal cinemedia  and continued pursuit of a growth strategy that will provide incremental returns to our stockholders

fiscal period compared to fiscal period admissions total admissions revenues increased million  or  to  million for the fiscal period  from  million for the fiscal period 
the increase in admissions revenues in the fiscal period compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a increase in attendance  which is principally related to the inclusion of regal cinemas and united artists for a full year in the fiscal period  the inclusion of hoyts from march  and the impact of the rd week of operations  partially offset by the net closure of screens during the fiscal period 
these box office results were favorably impacted by a increase in average ticket prices  which reflected actual price increases and the impact of a favorable film product mix 
the fiscal period includes the results of edwards from december  a full fiscal year  the results of united artists from january  a full fiscal year less one week and regal cinemas from january  approximately months 
excluding the effects of the inclusion of hoyts and the impact of week during the fiscal period  attendance for the fiscal period was approximately million  a decrease from the fiscal period 
concessions total concessions revenues increased million  or  to million for the fiscal period  from million for the fiscal period 
the increase in concessions revenues in the fiscal period compared to the fiscal period was due to the increase in attendance 
concessions revenue per patron declined for the fiscal period 
this decline is primarily attributable to film product mix  which was comprised of a higher proportion of r rated and pg rated films 
these films typically result in lower concession revenue per patron 
other operating revenues total other operating revenues increased million  or  to million for the fiscal period  from million for the fiscal period 
included in other operating revenues are on screen advertising revenues  meetings and events  marketing revenues from our vendor marketing programs and game revenues 
the increase in other operating revenues was primarily attributable to increases in advertising and meetings revenues generated by regal cinemedia  the inclusion of hoyts from march  and to a lesser extent  increases in our revenues from vendor marketing programs during the fiscal period 
film rental and advertising costs film rental and advertising costs increased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues decreased slightly to in the fiscal period as compared to in the fiscal period as a result of a decline in advertising expense and a lower percentage of box office revenues being derived from higher grossing films

cost of concessions cost of concessions increased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues increased slightly to in the fiscal period as compared to in the fiscal period 
the increase in the cost of concessions in the fiscal period as a percentage of concessions revenues is primarily attributable to product mix  offset by the realization of operating efficiencies realized through the integration of regal cinemas  united artists and edwards 
rent expense rent expense increased million  or  to million in the fiscal period from million in the fiscal period 
rent expense as a percentage of total revenues was and for the fiscal and fiscal periods  respectively

other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined to in the fiscal period as compared to in the fiscal period 
the increase in total other operating expenses in the fiscal period was primarily attributable to incremental costs associated with the inclusion of hoyts from march   the impact of week and a full year of regal cinemas and united artists during the fiscal period  coupled with incremental expenses associated with regal cinemedia  which did not begin substantive operations until the second fiscal quarter of the decline in other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues is primarily attributable to the fixed nature of various theatre operating expenses  coupled with an increase in total revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were approximately and in the fiscal and fiscal periods  respectively

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase during the fiscal period in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of regal cinemas including incremental capital expenditures associated with regal cinemedia for the fiscal period and the inclusion of hoyts from march  income from operations income from operations totaled approximately million for the fiscal period  which represents an increase of million  or from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in operating income during the fiscal period is primarily attributable to the growth in total revenues as a result of the inclusion of regal cinemas and united artists for a full year in the fiscal period  the results of hoyts from march  and the impact of week during the fiscal period  coupled with the realized benefits associated with the integration of regal cinemas  united artists and edwards 
the increase in operating income during the fiscal period was also attributable to a reduction of merger and restructuring expenses  partially offset by increases in certain other operating expense items described in previous sections 
interest expense net interest expense increased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in interest expense in the fiscal period is principally due to higher outstanding indebtedness for the fiscal period as a result of the financing arrangements consummated in the second fiscal quarter of in connection with the extraordinary dividend transaction

the fiscal period effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain non deductible merger expenses 
net income net income totaled million for the fiscal period  which represents an increase of million from million in the fiscal period 
fiscal period compared to fiscal period the company believes its historical results prior to the fiscal period are not indicative of its current operations  and  as a result  has provided only the following summary analysis of such results 
an in depth comparison of the fiscal period results versus those for the fiscal period has not been presented because i the historical results do not reflect the results of operations for regal cinemas for the period ended january  and these results are significant to the company  ii the historical results do not include a full year of operating results for regal cinemas or united artists for the fiscal period  and iii the company s capital structure has changed significantly subsequent to the fiscal period 
total revenues total revenues for the fiscal period increased  million  or from the fiscal period 
the increase in total revenues in the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the results of operations of united artists from january  a full fiscal year less one week  regal cinemas from january  approximately months and edwards from december  a full fiscal year as compared to the fiscal period  which included only the results of operations of united artists from march  approximately months and edwards from september  approximately months 
to a lesser extent  increases in average ticket prices of and average concessions per patron of contributed to the increase in total revenues for the fiscal period 
operating expenses total operating expenses for the fiscal period increased  million  or  from the fiscal period 
the increase in operating expenses in the fiscal period was principally related to the inclusion of the results of operations of united artists from january  a full fiscal year less one week  regal cinemas from january  approximately months and edwards from december  a full fiscal year as compared to the fiscal period  which included only the results of operations of united artists from march  approximately months and edwards from september  approximately months 
total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly to in the fiscal period from in the fiscal period  which is primarily attributable to the growth in total revenues and the realization of operating efficiencies associated with the integration of regal cinemas  united artists and edwards 
income from operations income from operations for the fiscal period increased million from the fiscal period 
the increase in operating income during the fiscal period is primarily attributable to the growth in total revenues as a result of the inclusion of the results of operations of united artists from january  a full fiscal year less one week  regal cinemas from january  approximately months and edwards from december  a full fiscal year as compared to the fiscal period  which included only the results of operations of united artists from march  approximately months and edwards from september  approximately months 
such increase was coupled with the realized benefits associated with the integration of regal cinemas  united artists and edwards 
net income net income for the fiscal period increased million from the fiscal period 
the increase in net income during the fiscal period is primarily attributable to the factors described in previous sections  partially offset by increases in interest expense associated with long term obligations of regal cinemas and an increase in the fiscal period prevision of income taxes over the fiscal period 
ebitda ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization was approximately million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal period  million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal period and million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal period 
we believe ebitda provides a useful measure of liquidity and financial performance for our investors because ebitda is an industry comparative measure of liquidity and financial performance prior to the payment of interest and taxes and because it is a primary financial measure used by management to assess our performance and liquidity 
ebitda is not a measurement of liquidity or financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for net income or other operations data or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity 
in addition  not all funds depicted by ebitda are available for management s discretionary use 
for example  a substantial portion of such funds are subject to contractual restrictions and functional requirements for debt service  fund necessary capital expenditures and to meet other commitments from time to time as described in more detail in this form k 
ebitda  as calculated  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda to net income is calculated as follows fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period in millions net cash provided by operating activities changes in working capital items and other income from operations depreciation and amortization minority interest and other  net ebitda depreciation and amortization interest expense  net provisions for income taxes net income cash flows the following table summarizes certain cash flow data for the fiscal  and periods fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash used in reorganization net increase in cash and cash equivalents fiscal period compared to fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net increase was attributable to a million increase in net income partially offset by a net decrease of million in adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities 
such adjustments included a reduction in deferred income taxes of million partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of million 
in addition  a net increase of million in changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net increase in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to a million increase in income taxes payable coupled with increases in the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal period compared to million for the fiscal period 
such increase is primarily due to the inclusion of hoyts from march  and a full twelve months of operations of regal cinemas and united artists during the fiscal period coupled with incremental capital expenditures associated with regal cinemedia  which did not begin substantive operations until the second fiscal quarter of cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal period also reflect approximately million of net cash used to acquire hoyts 
cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period is primarily attributable to the financing transactions and related payment of the extraordinary dividend  which is discussed more fully under liquidity and capital resources 
fiscal period compared to fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to approximately million for the fiscal period 
the increase was attributable to the inclusion of edwards  regal cinemas and united artists in the fiscal period and to increases in net income and non cash items and changes in working capital items 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal period compared to million for the fiscal period 
the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of edwards  regal cinemas and united artists in the fiscal period 
in addition  regal cinemas  inc had approximately million of cash on the date anschutz acquired its controlling equity interest 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service and the company s quarterly dividend 
our principal sources of liquidity are from our operating subsidiaries 
our operating subsidiaries principal uses of cash are for operating expenses  capital expenditures  and debt service 
the principal sources of liquidity for our subsidiaries are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and the revolving credit facilities provided for under regal cinemas third amended and restated credit agreement 
our revenues are generally collected in cash through admissions and concessions revenues 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately days from purchase 
our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within twelve months and  as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet is likely to reflect a working capital deficit 
we fund the cost of our operating subsidiaries capital expenditures through internally generated cash flow  cash on hand and financing activities 
our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre openings  adding new screens to existing theatres  development of our dcn  upgrading the company s theatre facilities and replacing equipment 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
we currently expect capital expenditures for theatre development  replacement  expansion  upgrading and maintenance to be in the range of million to million in fiscal in addition to capital expenditures associated with our theatre operations  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately to million in connection with regal cinemedia during fiscal regal cinemedia capital expenditures will be made in connection with the deployment of our dcn to provide advertising and promotional services and digital distribution content capabilities to additional markets coupled with expenditures for other in lobby advertising and promotional initiatives 
during the fiscal period  we invested an aggregate of approximately million in capital expenditures 
in may  we sold million shares of our class a common stock in an initial public offering at a price of per share  receiving aggregate net offering proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering expenses  of approximately million 
on august   reh acquired the remaining outstanding shares of common stock of united artists held by the united artists minority stockholders and warrants to acquire shares of common stock of united artists held by various institutional holders for approximately million 
the million difference between the carrying amount and purchase price of the minority interest was recorded as a component of goodwill 
on march   we completed our acquisition of certain theatre operations of hoyts representing a total of theatres and screens located in states in the northeastern united states for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purchase price included cash of approximately million  the issuance of  shares of regal s class a common stock to hush holdings us inc hush with an aggregate fair value of million and the assumption of certain capital lease obligations with an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
on may   all outstanding warrants held by anschutz to purchase a total of  shares of class b common stock and warrants held by certain other investors to purchase a total of  shares of class a common stock were exercised at exercise prices of per share 
proceeds from the transactions totaled approximately million 
on june   regal declared an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of its class a and class b common stock 
stockholders of record at the close of business on june  were paid this dividend on july  sources used to fund the approximate million extraordinary dividend included cash on hand of approximately million  the net proceeds of million from the term loan under the amended and restated regal cinemas senior credit facility and the net proceeds of million from the issuance by regal of million convertible senior notes 
the dividend was recorded as a reduction of retained earnings reduced to zero as of june  and additional paid in capital upon declaration 
as a result of this additional indebtedness  our principal and interest payment obligations will increase substantially 
the degree to which we will be leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
during the year ended january   we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of per share of class a and class b common stock  or million in the aggregate 
on march   the company paid a cash dividend of per share on each share of the company s class a and class b common stock to our stockholders on february  we  at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law  anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our class a and class b common stock for the foreseeable future 
the amount  if any  of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  loan agreement restrictions  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  as well as other relevant factors 
concurrent with the issuance of our convertible senior notes  we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our class a common stock in order to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes into shares of our class a common stock 
the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was approximately million and is included as a component of stockholders equity 
see long term obligations below and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further description of the above debt facilities and the related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
the million convertible senior notes discussed in note allow us to settle any conversion  and we have the ability and intent to settle any conversion  by remitting to the note holder the accreted value of the note in cash  while settling the conversion spread the excess conversion value over the accreted value in the shares of our class a common stock 
based upon our ability to generate cash flow from operations  our financial capacity and ability to raise capital and available cash on hand  we believe that we have the ability to generate the liquidity necessary to settle in cash the principal amount of the convertible senior notes upon a conversion event 
as of january   regal cinemas had million available under its undrawn amended and restated senior revolving credit facility  million outstanding under its senior secured term loan and million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due regal cinemas also maintains letters of credit of million of which approximately million was outstanding as of january   which reduces the availability under its senior revolving credit facility 
contractual cash obligations and commitments the company primarily leases its theatres pursuant to long term non cancelable operating leases 
as of january   the company s estimated contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments over the next several years are as follows in millions payments due by period total current years years after years contractual cash obligations long term debt  capital lease obligations lease financing arrangements bankruptcy claims and liabilities operating leases   other long term and purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations  amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts available current years years after years other commercial commitments total commercial commitments these amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  a portion of this debt is backed by letters of credit as described in footnote below

these amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information about our bankruptcy related matters 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we enter into additional operating lease agreements 
our operating lease obligations are further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as of january   regal cinemas had million available under its undrawn senior revolving credit facility 
regal cinemas also maintains letters of credit of million of which approximately million was outstanding as of january   which reduces the availability under its senior revolving credit facility 
the company believes that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash flow expected from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate for the company to execute its business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations  capital expenditures  working capital and debt service for at least months

under the terms of the convertible note hedge arrangement the convertible note hedge with credit suisse first boston csfb  we paid million for a forward purchase option contract under which we are entitled to purchase from csfb a fixed number of shares of our class a common shares at a current price per share of 
in the event of the conversion of the notes  this forward purchase option contract allows us to purchase  at a fixed price equal to the implicit conversion price of shares issued under the convertible notes  a number of shares equal to the shares that we issue to a note holder upon conversion 
settlement terms of this forward purchase option allow the company to elect cash or share settlement based on the settlement option it chooses in settling the conversion feature of the notes 
we accounted for the convertible note hedge pursuant to the guidance in eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock 
accordingly  the million purchase price of the forward stock purchase option contract was recorded as a debit to consolidated stockholders equity 
we also sold to csfb a warrant the warrant to purchase shares of our class a common stock 
the warrant is currently exercisable for  shares of our class a common stock at a current exercise price of per share 
we received million cash from csfb in return for the sale of this forward share purchase option contract 
csfb cannot exercise the warrant unless and until a conversion event occurs 
we have the option of settling the warrant in cash or shares of our class a common stock 
we accounted for the sale of the warrant as the sale of a permanent equity instrument pursuant to the guidance in eitf accordingly  the million sales price of the forward stock purchase option contract was recorded as a credit to consolidated stockholders equity 
the convertible note hedge and the warrant economically allow us to acquire sufficient class a common shares from csfb to meet our obligation to deliver class a common shares upon conversion by the note holder  unless the class a common share price exceeds 
when the fair value of our class a common shares exceeds such price  the equity contracts have an offsetting economic impact  and accordingly will no longer be effective as a hedge of the dilutive impact of possible conversion

regal cinemas  inc leveraged sale and leaseback during  regal cinemas  inc entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with an unaffiliated third party involving of its owned theatres 
under the terms of this transaction  regal cinemas  inc sold the land and related improvements of the theatres for million and leased them back for an initial lease term of years  with an option to extend it for up to additional years 
regal cinemas accounts for these leases as operating leases 
regal cinemas lease financing arrangements for some of the company s new theatre sites built in fiscal years  and  the company was considered the owner for accounting purposes of the theatre during the construction period 
in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  the company is required to record the balance sheet obligations million at january  when the construction of the theatre was completed resulting in payments being recorded as interest expense and principal reduction rather than rent expense 
these leases typically run for a period of years 
united artists leveraged sale and leaseback in december  united artists theatre circuit  inc uatc  one of our subsidiaries  entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby the land and buildings underlying of its operating theatres and four theatres and a screen addition under development were sold to and leased back from an unaffiliated third party 
the transaction requires uatc to lease the underlying theatres for a period of years and one month  with the option to extend for up to an additional years 
in conjunction with the transaction  the buyer of the properties issued publicly traded pass through certificates 
several of its properties included in the sale and leaseback transaction have been determined by uatc to be economically obsolete for theatre use 
as of january   theatres were subject to the sale leaseback transaction 
uatc amended the lease on march  to allow uatc to terminate the master lease with respect to the obsolete properties  to allow the owner trustee to sell those properties and pay down the underlying debt at a discount to par through september and par thereafter and to reduce the amount of rent paid by uatc on the lease 
included in the amendment is a million cap on the ability to sell properties 
through january  approximately million of this cap has been utilized through theatre sales 
three additional properties are no longer operational and are being marketed for sale 
an evaluation of the remaining theatres is performed on an ongoing basis 
approximately million in principal amount of pass through certificates were outstanding as of january  in connection with the sale and leaseback transaction  uatc entered into a participation agreement that requires uatc to comply with various covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  guarantees  issuances of preferred stock of subsidiaries and subsidiary distributions  transfer of assets and payment of dividends

two of the theatres have been determined by uatc to be economically obsolete and are no longer in operation 
bankruptcy claims regal cinemas  inc and edwards have bankruptcy claims that remain unsettled and are subject to ongoing negotiation and possible litigation 
at january   regal cinemas had accrued approximately million for the estimated costs to resolve such bankruptcy claims 
in the opinion of management  based on its examination of these matters  its experience to date and discussions with legal counsel  the outcome of these legal matters  after taking into consideration the amounts already accrued  is not expected to have a material effect on the company s liquidity or results of operations 
to the extent claims are allowed by the bankruptcy court  they will be funded with cash on hand  cash flow from operations or borrowings under regal cinemas revolving credit facility 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which includes  but are not limited to  those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and reorganization and purchase accounting 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we applied the principles of purchase and reorganization accounting when recording the acquisitions of controlling equity interests by anschutz and the exchange of stock for minority interests and the emergence from bankruptcy of the theatre companies and the subsequent acquisition of hoyts 
these accounting principles require that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities  including estimates of bankruptcy related claims and the related deferred tax assets and liabilities related to such amounts 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets in sfas specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management s best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film s opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
such adjustments have been historically insignificant 
actual film costs and film costs payable could differ materially from those estimates 
for the fiscal years ended january   december  and the period ended january   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life to us of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than forty years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment and certain dcn assets  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties were appraised as part of the bankruptcy process 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended january  and december  and the period ended january   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended january   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on their probable tax treatment 
in addition  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us and may be challenged by the tax authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such allowance on an ongoing basis 
should we ultimately realize a benefit from tax assets in excess of the amount recorded that relate to pre acquisition periods  goodwill would be reduced 
for the fiscal year ended january   our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes 
changes in these assumptions could potentially change the effective tax rate 
a one percent change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million 
quarterly results regal was created through a series of transactions during and anschutz acquired controlling equity interests in united artists and edwards upon the emergence from bankruptcy reorganization on march  of the united artists bankrupt entities and on september  of the edwards bankrupt entities 
on january   anschutz acquired a controlling equity interest in regal cinemas  inc when the regal cinemas  inc bankrupt entities emerged from bankruptcy reorganization 
anschutz exchanged its controlling equity interest in regal cinemas  inc for a controlling equity interest in regal cinemas immediately thereafter 
regal cinemas  inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of regal cinemas 
in addition  regal cinemedia was formed in february to focus on the development of ancillary revenues and became our wholly owned subsidiary on april  on april   regal cinemas  inc acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of edwards and  as a result  edwards became a wholly owned subsidiary of regal cinemas  inc on march   regal acquired hoyts 
accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired hoyts theatre locations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to the acquisition date of march  the company s financial statements reflect the results of operations from the dates anschutz acquired its controlling equity interests in united artists  edwards and regal cinemas 
these controlling equity interests have been recorded in the company s financial statements at anschutz s combined historical cost basis 
the company s financial statements for the year ended december  include the results of operations of united artists from january   edwards from december   and regal cinemas from january  
the company s financial statements for the year ended january  include the results of operations of united artists  edwards and regal cinemas from december  and hoyts from march  the comparability of our results between quarters is impacted by the inclusion from such dates of the results of operations of each of such entities and to a lesser extent  seasonality 
the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly results for the eight quarters ended january  the quarterly financial data as of each period presented below have been derived from regal s unaudited consolidated financial statements for those periods

see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further discussion 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
seasonality the company s revenues are usually seasonal  coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors 
generally  studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday seasons 
the unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern 
the timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations  and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other quarter 
the seasonality of motion picture exhibition  however  has become less pronounced in recent years as studios have begun to release major motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our operations  please refer to the information provided under note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
forward looking statements some of the information in this form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including  without limitation  certain statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business may constitute forward looking statements 
in some cases you can identify these forward looking statements by words like may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of those words and other comparable words 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under risk factors below 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a significant degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities 
our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition we have substantial lease and debt obligations 
for fiscal  our total rent expense and net interest expense were approximately million and million  respectively 
as of january   we had total long term obligations of  million 
as of january   we had current contractual cash obligations of approximately  million 
for a detailed discussion of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments over the next several years  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations and commitments provided above 
if we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations  we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets 
we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations 
many of our lease agreements and the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet 
if we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a lease or debt instrument  we would be in default under that instrument  which could  in turn  result in defaults under other leases and debt instruments 
any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity 
our theatres operate in a competitive environment 
the motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry 
theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres  particularly with respect to film licensing  attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites 
moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location  the films showing there and its amenities 
in recent years  motion picture exhibitors have been upgrading their asset bases to an attractive megaplex format which features stadium seating  improved projection quality and superior sound systems 
generally  a modern megaplex is preferred by patrons over a slope floored multiplex theatre  which was the dominant theatre type built prior to although  as of january   approximately of our screens were located in theatres featuring stadium seating  we still serve many markets with profitable sloped floored multiplex theatres 
these theatres may be more vulnerable to competition than our modern megaplex theatres  and should our competitors choose to build and operate modern megaplex theatres in these markets  the performance of our theatres in these markets may be significantly and negatively impacted 
in addition  should our competitors return to the aggressive building strategies undertaken from to  our attendance  revenue and operating income per screen could decline substantially 
we believe that in the foreseeable future  another evolution of theatre formats beyond the current megaplex is unlikely to occur 
accordingly  we do not believe that additional major amenities will be required to enhance the movie going experience meaningfully 
however  an unforeseen change in consumer preferences or technology may cause increased competition  require us to make large capital expenditures and adversely affect our operations 
our in theatre advertising business operates in a competitive environment 
regal cinemedia s in theatre advertising operations must compete with a number of other cinema advertising companies and advertising mediums including  most notably  television advertising 
there can be no guarantee that in theatre advertising will continue to attract major advertisers or that regal cinemedia s in theatre advertising format will be favorably received by the theatre going public 
if regal cinemedia is unable to generate expected sales of advertising  it may not maintain the level of profitability we hope to achieve  and its results of operations may be adversely affected 
we depend on motion picture production and performance 
our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability  diversity and appeal of motion pictures  our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets 
we mostly license first run motion pictures  the success of which have increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major studios 
poor performance of  or any disruption in the production of including by reason of a strike  these motion pictures  or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major studios  could hurt our business and results of operations 
in addition  a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers 
we may not benefit from our acquisition strategy 
we may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates 
even if we do identify such candidates  we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates  and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms 
moreover  some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are 
as a result of this competition for limited assets  we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition 
if we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates  we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected 
in any acquisition  we expect to benefit from cost savings through  for example  the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs  and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits 
nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to service debt incurred to finance an acquisition  our results of operations and profitability would be adversely affected 
any acquisition may involve operating risks  such as the difficulty of assimilating the acquired operations and personnel and integrating them into our current business  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the diversion of management s attention and other resources  the possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience  the potential impairment of relationships with employees  the possibility that any liabilities we may incur or assume may prove to be more burdensome than anticipated  and the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected 
we depend on our relationships with film distributors 
the film distribution business is highly concentrated  with nine major film distributors reportedly accounting for of admissions revenues and of the top grossing films during our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors 
in addition  we are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first run films 
a deterioration in our relationship with any of the nine major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and  therefore  could hurt our business and results of operations 
no assurance of a supply of motion pictures 
the distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases 
consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors  including us  on a film by film and theatre by theatre basis 
consequently  we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long term arrangements with major distributors  but must compete for our licenses on a film by film and theatre by theatre basis 
we must comply with the ada 
our theatres must comply with the ada 
compliance with the ada requires that public accommodations reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations 
noncompliance with the ada  including with respect to lines of sight requirements currently in dispute as described in greater detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k  could result in the imposition of injunctive relief  fines  an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance 
any such imposition of injunctive relief  fines  damage awards or capital expenditures could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
united artists  edwards and regal cinemas inc s reorganizations under the united states bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to borrow or access the capital markets in the future 
each of united artists  edwards and regal cinemas  inc filed for bankruptcy protection and were reorganized in accordance with the united states bankruptcy code 
a significant cause of those bankruptcies was the emphasis by theatre circuits on the development of large megaplexes 
the strategy of aggressively building megaplexes was adopted throughout the industry and generated significant competition and resulted in an oversupply of screens in the north american motion picture exhibition industry 
if these aggressive building strategies again become prevalent or if an unforeseen change in consumer preferences or technology requires us to make large capital expenditures or adversely affects our operations  our prior history may make it difficult for us to borrow money or access the capital markets on terms favorable to us  if at all 
our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations and as a result  the market price of our securities may be adversely affected 
our operating companies lack a combined operating history 
regal cinemas  united artists  edwards and hoyts operated as separate motion picture exhibitors until we acquired them 
in addition  regal cinemas  inc  united artists and edwards operated at a loss prior to their emergence from bankruptcy reorganization 
as a result  we have limited historical financial and operating data upon which you can evaluate our business 
we have a substantial investment in developing ancillary revenue opportunities that we may be unable to achieve 
we have invested and will continue to invest in upgrading our dcn software and distribution network  and we have developed a sales force to sell various marketing and content products that use the assets in which we have invested 
while revenue growth during resulting from these investments is encouraging  we may be unable to continue to attract significant interest in the products and services offered by regal cinemedia 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of advertising in our theatres  sell tickets to non film events such as concerts  or create additional revenue from alternative products and services  we may not maintain the level of profitability we hope to achieve  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
an increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and limit ticket prices 
we also compete with other movie delivery vehicles  including cable television  downloads via the internet  video disks and cassettes  satellite and pay per view services 
further  new technologies for movie delivery such as video on demand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we also compete for the public s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment  including sporting events  concerts  live theatre and restaurants 
development of digital technology will increase our capital expenses 
the industry is in the early stages of conversion from film based media to electronic based media 
there are a variety of constituencies associated with this anticipated change  which may significantly impact industry participants  including content providers  distributors  equipment providers and exhibitors 
should the conversion process rapidly accelerate and the major studios not finance the conversion as expected  we may have to raise additional capital to finance the conversion costs associated with this potential change 
the additional capital necessary may not  however  be available to us on attractive terms  if at all 
furthermore  it is impossible to accurately predict how the roles and allocation of costs between various industry participants will change if the industry changes from physical media to electronic media 
we depend on our senior management 
our success depends upon the retention of our senior management  including michael campbell and kurt hall  our co chairmen and co chief executive officers 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available 
the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
