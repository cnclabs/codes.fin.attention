overview we are a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company is organized in three segments architectural products and services architectural  large scale optical lso and automotive replacement glass and services autoglass 
our architectural segment companies design  engineer  fabricate  install  maintain and renovate the walls of glass and windows comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
businesses in this segment are viracon  a leading fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  one of the largest us full service building glass installation  maintenance and renovation companies  wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall  and linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  a value added glass and acrylic manufacturer for the custom framing and pre framed art markets  and a producer of optical thin film coatings for consumer electronics displays 
our autoglass segment consists of viracon curvlite  a us fabricator of aftermarket foreign and domestic car windshields 
our architectural segment is the largest and most cyclical segment in our portfolio 
the segment services the commercial construction markets  which have been in the low end of the construction cycle for the past two years and did not begin to turn around during our fiscal as we had anticipated 
although we outperformed the nonresidential construction market based on reports by fw dodge  a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends  industry 
table of contents conditions led to lower volume  project delays and pricing pressures 
additionally  isolated project management issues impacted margins in our glass installation business  and we did not anticipate the severity of the downturn and reduce segment costs quickly enough in fiscal to offset the declining demand 
we are expecting market conditions to continue at the current level through fiscal with moderate market growth to begin in late fiscal these expectations are based on market forecasts provided by external sources that may not come to fruition 
additionally  we are expecting our installation business to be better able to manage projects in fiscal and  once the current backlog of jobs runs its course in early fiscal  our outlook reflects this improvement in project management 
through our identified growth strategies  we intend to capitalize on current high potential products and markets in the architectural segment  while adding complementary services demanded by our customers 
in architectural glass  we are working to increase market share to offset our markets that are not expected to grow significantly through fiscal we are focused on increasing sales in education and health care  in addition to our already strong presence in office buildings  and also increasing our sales in certain domestic geographic markets where our presence is not as strong as in other regions 
a second architectural glass opportunity that we have targeted is to provide smaller  less complex projects with coated  fabricated glass 
this broader market is regional in nature because of the shorter lead times demanded by customers 
we will serve a portion of this growing regional fabrication market from our plants in minnesota and georgia  and we are considering investing in additional facilities to expand our coverage in the us another architectural strategic initiative involves our architectural products and services businesses which install glass on new buildings  renovate window and curtainwall systems on older buildings  provide glass services  and design and assemble windows and curtainwall 
we are improving the performance of these businesses  while also focusing on opportunities to expand our renovation and glass installation work in current markets 
in addition  we are considering expansion into storefront and entrance products that will allow us to grow sales of our window and curtainwall products by offering a full product line from a single source 
within our lso segment  we are implementing strategies to drive greater penetration of value added glass in traditional custom framing markets  as well as in newer institutional fine art and international sectors 
during fiscal  it was determined that the pricing pressures  competitive nature and our inability to compete in the consumer electronic markets was resulting in unpredictable and unprofitable results 
accordingly  we decided to focus on further expanding the use of value added glass in the picture framing industry where our leadership position can be enhanced 
two recent decisions will further our focus on picture framing we integrated the two businesses in the segment  resulting in cost savings and greater coating capacity to meet the growing demand for picture framing products  and  in the first quarter of fiscal  sold our small framing matboard line  a non strategic product line 
expenses relating to re focusing this segment are anticipated to continue through fiscal as we identify more efficient means to manufacture and distribute our picture framing products and direct our attention away from some consumer electronic markets 
the autoglass segment experienced the greatest change during this past fiscal year 
through the sale of harmon autoglass  an under performing business serving an extremely competitive market  a key step in our overall strategic repositioning was accomplished 
the harmon autoglass business is reported as a discontinued operation throughout this discussion and the following financial statements 
the remaining business  which manufactures aftermarket windshields primarily for a single customer  ppg industries  inc ppg  continues to perform at adequate levels  and we will continue to operate this business to maximize its cash flow 
however  this market continues to experience pricing pressures due to the influx of offshore products 
additionally  pressure from insurance companies  which usually pay for retail windshield replacements  to lower costs  has put pressure throughout the supply chain 
these influences also affect the performance of our joint venture reported in equity in earnings loss of affiliated companies 
in march  we received the required advance notice from ppg indicating that the windshield supply agreement curvlite operates under will be terminated on the expiration date in july  which is during fiscal we are in discussions with ppg regarding a new supply agreement 
this is not anticipated to have a material effect on fiscal earnings 
results of operations net sales dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales decreased percent in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the net decrease was primarily attributable to volume reductions and lower pricing due to competitive pressures in the architectural 
table of contents segment  and the continued slowdown in the commercial construction industry 
weak conditions in the commercial construction market caused projects to delay throughout the year  resulting in a continual delay in the activity and  accordingly  adversely impacting revenues recognized in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales decreased percent in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the net decrease was attributable to a slowdown in the commercial construction industry affecting the architectural segment  and volume reductions and lower pricing due to competitive pressures in the auto glass segment 
these reductions were partially offset by revenue gains in the lso segment from new product introductions and conversions of our customers to our higher margin  value added picture framing glass 
performance the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percentage of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income  net equity in loss of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax earnings from continuing operations loss earnings from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net loss earnings fiscal compared to fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased to percent for fiscal  from percent in fiscal the primary factors for the percentage point decrease in margins were the effects of the slowed commercial construction market affecting the architectural segment  resulting in reduced volume  pricing pressures  as well as project management issues encountered at our glass installation business 
additionally  the lso segment recognized integration costs and a charge associated with the sale of its matboard product line that  collectively  resulted in a percentage point impact 
these costs were offset by increased sales of higher value added products in the lso segment 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to percent from percent as expenses declined year over year from million to million in fiscal nearly all of the decreases occurred in the architectural segment as a result of lower performance based incentive expenses  and lower salary and wage related expenses from reduced headcount 
these were offset by increases in outside consulting fees and lower gains from sales of non strategic assets in the current year versus the prior period 
net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting lower borrowing levels and a lower weighted average interest rate under our revolving credit agreement 
other income in fiscal was only million versus million in the prior year  which reflected the pretax benefit of realized gains on the sale of investments held for our self insurance program in fiscal as part of normal investment portfolio management  our wholly owned insurance subsidiary sold appreciated marketable debt securities  creating this gain in the prior period 
our equity in loss from affiliated companies was million in fiscal  versus equity in loss of million in the prior year 
the additional loss is related to a decline in the performance of the ppg auto glass joint venture as a result of a very competitive auto glass replacement industry  which has experienced reduced volume and lower pricing 

table of contents our income tax benefit of million in the current year represents a statutory tax rate of percent offset by tax credits and other deductions realized for tax that did not require book expense  the most significant of which related to research and development tax credits and a higher valuation of a charitable donation of a patent donated in fiscal our fiscal earnings from continuing operations decreased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
the decrease in earnings is largely attributable to the revenue decline and operational issues in our architectural segment 
current year loss from discontinued operations was million or diluted earnings per share  compared to million in earnings or diluted earnings per share in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we announced plans to sell harmon autoglass 
during the third quarter  we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business to synergistic international  inc  a subsidiary of the dwyer group of waco  texas  and the sale was finalized during the fourth quarter 
all prior period results have been restated to reflect harmon autoglass as a discontinued operation 
the current year results include a loss on the sale of harmon auto glass and costs associated with the exit of the business totaling million  or per diluted share 
the remaining loss of million  or per share  represents harmon autoglass s operating results for the period in which we owned harmon autoglass 
the prior year total includes a loss from operations of harmon autoglass of million  or per share  offset by income of million  or per diluted share  related to a reduction in our estimates of the ultimate liabilities for the discontinued european curtainwall operation described under discontinued operations below 
our fiscal net loss was million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to million of net earnings  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago fiscal compared to fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  fell to percent for fiscal  from percent in fiscal the primary factors for the increased margins were from efficiencies gained as a result of the higher levels of capacity utilization in our lso segment as well as efficiency gains and sales of higher margin products in the architectural segment 
the combined impact of these items increased margins by percentage points 
this was offset by reductions in the autoglass segment margin caused by reduced pricing 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to percent from percent  but remained essentially flat year over year at approximately million 
increases in the architectural segment associated with the renovation initiative were offset in part by reductions in salaries and related costs in the segment as a result of reducing its overall cost structure as well as a reduction related to the elimination of amortization of goodwill 
decreased performance based incentive expenses  lower training costs  gain on sale of assets and lower bad debt expenses also contributed to offset these higher expenses 
net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting lower borrowing levels and a lower weighted average interest rate under our revolving credit agreement 
the effects of the lower borrowing levels and rate were offset by less interest collected from tax refunds received during the year in comparison to the prior year 
other income in fiscal reflects million pretax benefit of realized gains on the sale of investments held for our self insurance program as compared to million in the prior year 
the increased gains in fiscal reflect a significant sale of marketable securities 
as part of normal investment portfolio management  the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiary sold appreciated marketable debt securities  creating this gain 
our equity in loss from affiliated companies was million in fiscal versus equity in loss of million in the prior year 
this additional loss is related to a decline in the performance of the ppg auto glass joint venture as a result of strong competition and significantly reduced prices 
additionally  amendments made to supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture in the prior year second quarter led to lower earnings during the current year for ppg auto glass and increased earnings for the auto glass segment in the amount of million 
these declines were partially offset by the elimination of funding for the terrasun joint venture  which was shut down during the third quarter of fiscal our effective income tax rate of percent of pre tax earnings from continuing operations decreased from the percent of pre tax earnings from continuing operations reported in fiscal this reduction was due to the donation of the terrasun patented technology to the illinois institute of technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a significant deduction that reduced the fiscal rate in comparison to the prior year 

table of contents our fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
the increase in earnings is largely attributable to the revenue and productivity gains within our lso segment  the elimination of goodwill amortization due to a change in accounting standards and reduced interest and taxes  offset by declines for our architectural segment and losses from our affiliated companies 
fiscal income from discontinued operations is primarily the result of a reduction in our estimates of the ultimate liabilities for the discontinued european curtainwall operation 
this resulted in net income of million  or diluted earnings per share 
the remainder represents the operating results of harmon autoglass  which incurred a loss of million  or diluted earnings per share 
in fiscal  income from discontinued operations of million consisted entirely of earnings from harmon autoglass 
the change in results for harmon autoglass was due to lower pricing within the competitive auto glass market year over year 
our fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to million of net earnings  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago 
segment analysis architectural products and services architectural in thousands net sales operating loss income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal architectural net sales for fiscal decreased percent to million from million in fiscal the decrease is due to the effects of the slowed economy on the north american commercial construction industry as the number of projects to bid and work on  and the pricing on those projects declined 
the number and amount of delays in construction project timing also increased during the year 
the impact of these items resulted in lower sales for all of our architectural business units  but primarily affected revenues in our installation and window manufacturing businesses 
the segment experienced an operating loss for the year of million compared to operating income in fiscal of million 
operating margin decreased to percent for fiscal from percent in fiscal the reduced revenues had a significant impact on operating income and margin 
hardest hit by project delays in fiscal were our glass installation  window and architectural glass businesses 
the delays  along with pricing pressures and isolated project management issues in the installation group  impacted margins and earnings 
also impacting the segment was the fact that the mix of work included more institutional work  which generally provides lower margins than the office sector projects 
fiscal compared to fiscal architectural net sales for fiscal decreased percent to million from million in fiscal the decrease is due to the effects of the slowed economy on the north american commercial construction industry and to delays in construction project timing 
the impact of these items resulted in lower sales for most of our architectural business units 
this segment s revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in institutional projects and revenues earned on renovation projects 
operating income for the segment in fiscal decreased percent to million from million in the prior year 
operating margin decreased to percent for fiscal from percent in fiscal the majority of the decline in operating income was due to excess capacity associated with the revenue decline 
we took actions in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and early part of the first quarter of fiscal to lower the cost structure to reflect the current market outlook 
additionally  the level of institutional projects  which have lower margins  increased in fiscal the margin decline was partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies in our glass and window fabricating business units 
large scale optical technologies lso in thousands net sales operating income loss operating income loss as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal lso net sales of million were flat compared to fiscal picture framing revenues grew approximately with an increase in value added picture framing glass offset by reduced sales in our clear 
table of contents glass  matboard and consumer electronics business sales 
operating income declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the current year results included a million charge related to restructuring the segment by merging the two business units in order to focus on picture framing glass and reduce operating costs and a million non cash charge for the write down of matboard product line inventory that we disposed of in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal lso net sales of million increased percent over fiscal and operating income improved from a loss of million to income of million in fiscal these increases were the result of several successful new product introductions  particularly in applying coatings to acrylic  and continued conversions and wider distribution of value added picture framing glass 
also contributing were improvements in key consumer electronics and retail framing markets 
in addition  operational improvements from the company wide six sigma effort improved operating margins for the segment 
automotive replacement glass and services autoglass in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal auto glass net sales  which includes only our manufacturing business  decreased percent to million in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  pricing under the company s supply agreement with ppg  to which a significant percentage of our manufacturing capacity is sold  was changed to better reflect market pricing 
this decreased the segment s revenues by approximately percent  or million 
manufacturing unit volume increased over the prior year  offsetting some of the pricing declines 
additionally  average manufacturing pricing declined by percent in the current year in comparison to fiscal auto glass operating income decreased to million in fiscal from operating income of million in fiscal due to a combination of overall pricing declines and changes in the pricing terms of the supply agreement with ppg 
these items were partially offset by volume increases and operational improvements within our manufacturing business 
the net of the above caused the operating margin to decline to percent from percent 
this segment s operating income includes results from manufacturing and the market based pricing amendments to the supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture that were effective in fiscal we agreed to amend the existing pricing amendments during the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to reflect declines in market pricing 
beginning with fiscal  this will negatively impact the segment s results with an offsetting benefit to equity in earnings of affiliates 
fiscal compared to fiscal auto glass net sales decreased percent to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower prices as a result of competitive pricing pressures 
the average price in our manufacturing business declined by more than percent for the current year in comparison to fiscal our unit volume remained relatively consistent with the prior year  with declines in the first half of the year followed by improvements in year over year volumes in the second half 
auto glass operating income decreased to million in fiscal from operating income of million in fiscal due to pricing declines in manufacturing businesses 
these items were partially offset by operational improvements as well as gains from the sale of real estate 
discontinued operations we announced on september   that we intended to sell our retail auto glass business  harmon autoglass 
on january   the company completed the cash sale of harmon autoglass 
during fiscal  the company recorded a million  after tax charge  representing a reduction in the carrying value of this business unit to its estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
estimated liabilities have been recorded for committed future cash flows related to the sale 
we expect the process for the sale to be finalized during the first quarter of fiscal  with any necessary working capital adjustment to the selling price to be made at that time 
in several transactions in fiscal years through  the company completed the sale of its large scale domestic curtainwall business  the sale of the company s detention security business and its exit from international curtainwall operations 
the majority of the future cash expenditures related to these businesses are expected to be made within the next three years 
the majority of the reserve relates to the international curtainwall operations  including bonds outstanding  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters will not be known until they are settled within the uk and french courts 
for the outstanding matter within the uk  the plaintiff is required to file documents with the court by september 
table of contents at which time we will be able to begin the discovery process and better evaluate the plaintiff demands 
for the outstanding matter within france  we are expecting a ruling to be made by the french court by june  which may be appealed 
the reserve also covers other liability issues  consisting of warranty and rework issues  relating to these and other international construction projects 
at february   assets and liabilities totaling million and million  respectively  represented the remaining estimated future net cash outflows associated with the company s exit from discontinued operations 
this compared to million assets and million liabilities at march  the net reduction in assets and liabilities relates to harmon autoglass assets and liabilities that were sold during fiscal related party transactions as a result of our percent interest in ppg auto glass  in which ppg holds the remaining interest  various transactions the company enters into with ppg and ppg auto glass are deemed to be related party transactions 
under the terms of a multi year agreement expiring in july  our manufacturing auto glass business is committed to selling a significant portion of its windshield capacity to ppg 
terms of the agreement between our manufacturing business and ppg require notification of termination by july the terms are negotiated equivalent to an arm s length basis 
in march  we received the required advance notice from ppg indicating that the windshield supply agreement curvlite operates under will be terminated on the expiration date in july  which is during fiscal we are in discussions with ppg regarding a new supply agreement 
this is not anticipated to have a material effect on fiscal earnings 
additionally  at the time of formation of ppg auto glass  harmon autoglass entered into a multi year agreement pursuant to which it committed to purchase percent of its windshield requirements from ppg auto glass 
as part of the sale of harmon autoglass  these purchase commitments remained with harmon autoglass 
liquidity and capital resources cash effect  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations capital expenditures proceeds from dispositions of property borrowing activities  net purchases and retirement of company common stock operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the most significant items that affected the decline from the past year is the reduction of earnings from continuing operations of million and increases in non cash working capital current assets less cash and current liabilities of million 
the increase in non cash working capital was primarily due to the increase in refundable income taxes  as we are expecting a significant refund during fiscal management of working capital resources is a focus for us  and we expect to reduce non cash working capital in fiscal investing activities 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for the last three years are lower compared to our historical patterns as a direct result of our focus on filling the capacity of significant expansion projects initiated in fiscal and fiscal the architectural segment s capacity utilization at the end of fiscal was approximately percent  indicating that capital requirements for expansion will be limited over the foreseeable future as growth initiatives fill the remaining available capacity 
in fiscal  the company expects to incur capital expenditures as necessary to maintain existing facilities  safety and information systems  as well as some capacity improvements within the lso segment 
fiscal expenditures are expected to be less than million 
this amount does not include any acquisitions or regional expansions that we may consider as part of our overall strategic and performance objectives 
in fiscal   and  we had proceeds on the sale of certain land  buildings and equipment totaling million  million and million  respectively 
we have been focused on reducing our investment in non core business assets over the past several years  which has resulted in these proceeds 
included in the fiscal and fiscal amounts were sale and leaseback agreements on miscellaneous buildings and equipment totaling million and million  respectively 
under these and other sale and leaseback agreements  we have an option to purchase equipment at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the leases  which occurs after fiscal 
table of contents we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may acquire other businesses  further invest in  fully divest and or sell off parts of our current businesses 
financing activities 
net payments on all of our borrowings for fiscal   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we continued to focus on debt reduction during fiscal  evidenced by the reduction in our debt to total capital ratio  which improved to percent at the end of fiscal  compared to percent at the end of fiscal the majority of our long term debt at the end of the year  million  consisted of bank borrowings under a syndicated revolving credit facility 
we expect to reduce debt further during fiscal in april  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of  million shares of our common stock 
we purchased approximately  shares during fiscal  paying out million throughout the year at an average price of 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of  million shares of our common stock 
we completed this repurchase program by buying back  million shares in fiscal paying out million throughout the year at an average price of per share 
we also purchased million and million of company stock from employees pursuant to terms of board approved compensation plans during fiscal and  respectively 
it is our present intention to use the repurchase shares solely to offset the dilutive impact of management stock option exercises and to fund our equity based compensation plans 
stock purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices 
other financing activities 
the following summarizes significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity future cash payments due by period in thousands thereafter total borrowings under credit facility industrial revenue bonds other long term debt operating leases undiscounted purchase obligations other obligations total cash obligations during fiscal  there were no significant changes to our overall debt structure 
during fiscal  the company entered into a four year  unsecured  revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
as defined by the credit facility  we are required to maintain levels of net worth and certain financial ratios 
these ratios include maintaining an interest coverage ratio of more than and a debt to cash flow ratio of less than 
at february   these ratios were and  respectively 
if the company is not in compliance with these ratios at the end of any quarter with respect to interest coverage or at the end of any day with respect to the debt to cash flow ratio  the lender may terminate the commitment and or declare any loan then outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
this credit facility replaced the company s previously existing million secured credit facility 
the industrial revenue bonds in the total above are supported by million of letters of credit 
amounts available under the million credit facility are reduced by the aggregate outstanding principal amount of loans and letter of credit obligations issued under the credit facility 
at february   the company s available commitment under the facility was million 
at february   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the credit facility 
from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  vehicles  office equipment and some manufacturing equipment  through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 
the other contractual obligations relate to non compete and consulting agreements with former employees 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit 
table of contents in addition to the above standby letters of credit  which are predominantly issued for performance related bonds in our discontinued european curtainwall business  we are required  in the ordinary course of business  to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non performance 
the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of installation projects that are in process and in our backlog 
at february   these bonds totaled million 
our installation business has never been required to pay on these performance based bonds 
the company maintains interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert million and million of variable rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings at percent and percent  respectively 
the swap agreements expire in fiscal and  respectively 
the net present liability associated with these swaps was million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
we experienced a material increase in our insurance premiums and risk retention for our third party product liability coverages in fiscal  and although we were able to continue these coverages in fiscal  the premiums and retention remained high 
there were no significant changes to the policies for fiscal a material construction project rework event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
for fiscal  we believe that current cash on hand and cash generated from operating activities should be adequate to fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures 
if we are unable to generate enough cash through operations to satisfy our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures  we have available funds from our committed revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of routine operating leases  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements at february  or march  outlook the following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
overall revenues for the year are expected to increase to percent  with most of the growth coming in the first half of the year 
architectural segment revenues are expected to increase from percent no market improvement to percent market improvement during the year 
lso revenues are expected to be flat compared to the prior year 
auto glass manufacturing revenues are expected to be more than percent lower than in fiscal annual gross margins are expected to be approximately percentage points higher than the prior year  as operational improvements and cost reductions are somewhat offset by higher costs for wages and insurance 
expected annual operating margins by segment are architectural  approximately to percent  lso  to percent  and auto glass  to percent 
quarterly year over year growth in the architectural backlog is required to meet earnings per share expectations 
lso sales of value added picture framing glass products are expected to grow to percent  offset by the sale of the matboard business and declining consumer electronics revenues 
sg a is projected to be slightly lower as a percentage of sales 
equity in affiliates  which now reflects apogee s portion of the results of the ppg auto glass joint venture  is expected to have income of million  with the increase in earnings resulting from amending the existing ppg auto glass joint venture pricing amendments to better reflect market pricing 
full year capital expenditures are targeted at million  excluding any strategic initiatives 
depreciation and amortization is estimated at million for the year 
debt is expected to be reduced further by year end  excluding any strategic initiatives 
the effective tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be percent 
earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to range from to for fiscal discontinued operations in early fiscal are expected to reflect limited costs related to the finalization of the sale of harmon autoglass
