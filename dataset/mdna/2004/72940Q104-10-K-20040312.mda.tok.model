plumtree software  inc we  plumtree or the company  was incorporated in california on july  and reincorporated in delaware on may  our initial public offering of  shares of common stock was completed on june  
table of contents plumtree develops  markets and sells corporate portal  collaboration  content management and search software as well as related services for enterprises 
these technologies work together in an online work environment that we call the enterprise web 
the enterprise web offers customers a foundation designed to build web applications more quickly  at lower cost 
our enterprise web solution allows an enterprise s employees  customers and partners to interact with different types of information and applications in one web site and empowers users to create new information and services 
our software also supports a wide range of online business processes  so users can complete tasks more efficiently 
we derive our revenue and generate cash from customers from primarily two sources i product license revenue  and ii software license maintenance  professional services and training revenue 
for and  our net revenue was million and million  respectively  and our net income loss was million and million  respectively 
the decreased spending levels of our potential corporate and government customers as well as increased competition have adversely impacted our revenue and net income 
during the past two years  we have experienced weakness in corporate level spending  with many of our customers delaying new or expanded technology solution implementations 
in addition to total revenue and net income  in evaluating our business  management considers  among many other factors  the following revenue by category license  maintenance and professional services and training our license revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease over the year ended december   resulting primarily from the downturn in the overall market for information technology and software as well as increased competition 
we offer professional services to deploy the plumtree corporate portal and other products at customer sites  and to train alliance members  including technology vendors and systems integrators  maintenance and customer care through technical support and assigned account managers  and a series of training classes designed to provide our customers and alliance members with the knowledge and tools necessary to deploy  administer and expand the portal within the enterprise 
revenue from maintenance and technical support in was million  an increase of million or over  resulting from an increase in maintenance revenue from our new customers as well as from renewals of maintenance contracts by our installed base of customers 
revenue attributable to professional services increased in to million as compared to in  primarily related to increased headcount within the professional services department as headcount increased to consultants in from consultants in training revenue decreased in by approximately  as compared to we expect our maintenance  professional services and training revenue in general to increase in  primarily due to increased maintenance revenue from both new customers as well as renewals from our installed customer base 
deferred revenue balances our deferred revenue balance at december  was million  of which approximately million is deferred license revenue  approximately million is deferred maintenance revenue and million is deferred professional services and training revenue 
in  our total deferred revenue balance increased  over the increase in total deferred revenue from to is principally related to an increase in deferred maintenance revenue offset by decreases in deferred license revenue and deferred professional services and training revenue 
deferred license revenue decreased million in as compared to due primarily to the recognition of approximately million in revenue during from the december  balance 

table of contents deferred maintenance revenue increased million in as compared to related to an increase in deferred maintenance revenue from new customers as well as renewals of maintenance contracts by our installed base of customers 
deferred professional services and training revenue decreased  in as compared to as less of our customers at the end of prepaid for services and training than in during we expect our deferred revenue balances to remain consistent with with the breakdown of deferred revenue continuing to shift from deferred license revenue into deferred maintenance revenue as more of our customers renew their maintenance contracts 
number of license revenue transactions and breakdown of new customers versus repeat customers during the year ended december   we closed license transactions  including new customers or of our total license transactions and repeat orders or of our total license transactions bringing our total number of customers since inception to over during the year ended december   we closed license transactions  which included new customers or of our total license transactions and repeat orders or of our total license transactions 
revenue by geographic region we operate our business in two geographic regions united states and international  which consists of europe  middle east and africa emea  japan and asia pacific apac and canada 
in  of our revenue was generated within the united states  with international revenue accounting for of our total revenue 
our united states and international operations have experienced many of the same economic trends set forth above 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  up from million at december  we expect that our primary utilization of cash in will continue to be salaries  commissions  bonuses and other payroll related costs 
net cash flows from operations in the year ended december  was  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash flows from operations flow was driven primarily by the decrease in our net income loss as well as a decrease in our accrued liabilities 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  assessing the realizability of capitalized acquired technology  and determination of the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
software revenue recognition the company s software arrangements typically include i an end user license that provides for an initial fee in exchange for a customer s use of the company s products in perpetuity based on a specified number of users or cpus  ii a maintenance arrangement that provides for technical support and product updates over a period of months  and iii a professional service arrangement on a time and materials basis 
the company recognizes software revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position no 
software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  professional services and maintenance  but does not exist 
table of contents for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
the company allocates revenue to each undelivered element based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
the company determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on consistent pricing of maintenance and maintenance renewals as a percentage of net license fees 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the period that these elements are delivered 
for substantially all of the company s software arrangements  the company defers revenue for the fair value of the maintenance and professional services to be provided to the customer and recognizes revenue for the software license when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is deemed probable 
the company evaluates each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement the company considers a non cancelable agreement signed by the company and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery delivery is considered to occur when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
acceptance the company s typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
if the arrangement specifies acceptance provisions  the company defers the revenue until the earlier of when written acceptance is received from the customer or the customer s acceptance rights expire 
fixed or determinable fee the company considers the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and is on standard payment terms 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  the company recognizes the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is deemed probable the company conducts a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if the company expects that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if the company determines that collection is not probable  the company defers the revenue and recognizes the revenue upon cash collection 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of december  and  respectively for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
the decrease in our allowance for doubtful accounts is due primarily to the improved economic environment  improved collection efforts and increased management focus on collection matters 
the total allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised of a specific reserve and a general reserve 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the size of the accounts receivable aging  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
unless specific indications arise earlier  we review any invoice greater than days past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for all invoices billed  and not included in the specific reserve  by applying a percentage based on each day age category 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
however  historically the reserve has proven to be adequate 

table of contents income taxes we provided a valuation allowance of million against the entire net deferred tax asset as of december  the valuation allowance was recorded given the accumulated losses we have incurred and uncertainties regarding our future operating profitability and taxable income 
our income tax provision is primarily related to income and withholding taxes on sales and income generated in non us and domestic state tax jurisdictions for which no us benefit is currently recognizable 
for the years ended december  and we recorded an income tax provision of  and million related to these tax liabilities 
assessing the realizability of capitalized acquired technology we have capitalized the costs of certain purchased technology 
we periodically review these costs to ensure they are being recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value is determined using assumed future cash flows related to sales of the underlying technology 
had different assumed cash flows been used  materially different amounts of the carrying amount of these costs could have been reported 
at december   the unamortized costs related to the purchased software were approximately million and are included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
determination of fair value of options granted to employees in connection with the granting of certain stock options  we recorded deferred stock based compensation charges in the periods before our initial public offering representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price 
we determined the deemed fair value based upon several factors including our operating performance  issuances of our convertible preferred stock and valuations of comparable publicly traded software companies 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation and we recognized million of stock based compensation expense 
for the years ended december  and  we did not record any deferred stock based compensation and we recognized million and million of stock based compensation expense 
we apply the intrinsic value method in accounting for employee stock options apply in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  we recognize no compensation expense with respect to stock based awards to employees with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the award on the date of grant 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of the stock  materially different amounts of stock based compensation could have been reported 
had we applied fair value accounting for our stock options as outlined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  our operating results would have been affected as follows years ended december  net income loss as reported add stock based employee compensation expense included in net income loss deduct stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards pro forma net loss under sfas net income loss per common share basic as reported under apb pro forma under sfas net income loss per common share diluted as reported under apb pro forma under sfas

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we incur additional costs associated with being a public company  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  changes to the nasdaq listing rules and other related rules and regulations 
many of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and changes to the nasdaq listing rules are not yet fully enacted or applicable to us yet 
our compliance obligations will likely require us to hire additional full time employees or hire third party consultants

table of contents operating expenses research and development

liquidity and capital resources since  we have primarily financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
in june  we completed our initial public offering resulting in net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million in working capital 
our net cash provided by operating activities was  and million for the years ended december  and this decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities is principally related to the decrease in net income loss of million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents capital expenditures were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures consisted of purchases of items to manage our operations  including computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
we entered into a million revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank  which originally matured in march  and was extended through august in august  we modified the line of credit agreement to decrease the original principal amount to million and extended the maturity date through august to secure any outstanding loans  we have granted silicon valley bank a security interest in our assets  including our accounts receivable 
interest on the loans is payable monthly and accrues at one percentage point above the prime rate as announced by silicon valley bank 
we draw down on this bank line from time to time 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under this facility 
in addition  we have issued a letter of credit for million  which is enforceable against the facility 
we are prohibited from declaring and paying dividends  incurring any non permitted indebtedness and acquiring the capital stock of any other company under our loan agreements with silicon valley bank 
we expect to maintain our current operating expenses for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
as a result  we anticipate that these operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months  including working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations liabilities reflected on the balance sheet purchase obligations long term debt obligations total includes only expected cash payments and therefore excludes deferred revenue as well as deferred rent  which is our sole long term liability

table of contents risk factors that may affect our future results and the market price of our stock risks relating to our business our efforts to establish and maintain the enterprise web suite and related products as an enterprise wide platform may fail and  as a result  our revenue may not increase and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired 
we have expended  and plan to continue to expend  significant resources to establish our enterprise web suite as an enterprise wide platform for integrating an organization s diverse systems and applications and for building new applications 
to succeed  we must develop and market both enhancements to our plumtree corporate portal and new products and services that expand its functionality 
plumtree collaboration server and plumtree studio server  each released commercially in the first quarter of  and our content server released in november  are our most significant new product developments since the introduction of the plumtree corporate portal 
these and other new products and subsequent versions of our products may not achieve widespread market acceptance 
even if we are successful in establishing our products as an enterprise wide platform  we face  among others  the following risks we will likely face new and in many cases larger competitors  and some of our current system integrators and technology partners with whom we work closely may come to view our new products and services as competitive with their own products and services 
in order to remain competitive  we must increase the number of systems and applications that can be integrated into and built with our portal platform as web services  which will increasingly strain our development and support infrastructure and may require us to add significant additional personnel 
the industry may develop and adopt technology standards different from the standards presently incorporated in our products resulting in our products becoming less competitive 
we have a short operating history  which limits your ability to evaluate our business and operating results and may increase the risk of your investment 
our short operating history makes the evaluation of our business operations and our prospects difficult 
we were founded in and began offering version of our corporate portal product in march the latest version of our portal product  version  was released in june we cannot predict whether this version of our portal will be successful 
we have derived all of our revenue from licensing our enterprise web suite and related products and services 
you should consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies such as ours in new and rapidly evolving markets  particularly those companies whose businesses depend on the internet 
these risks and difficulties include potential fluctuations in operating results and uncertain growth rates  limited market acceptance of our products  concentration of our revenue on a small range of products  our need to expand our direct sales forces and indirect sales channels  particularly for international markets  and our need to attract  train and retain qualified personnel 
we have a history of losses  and we may never sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  which would have a harmful effect on our business and the value of our common stock 
we incurred substantial net losses in each year from our inception in july through for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
although we achieved annual profitability of approximately million in  for 
table of contents the year ended december  we had a net loss of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
given the level of our planned operating and capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future we expect our results of operations to fluctuate  and during this period we may incur losses and negative cash flows 
if our revenue does not increase  or if our expenses increase at a greater pace than our revenue  we will not be able to sustain operating profitability on a consistent basis  if at all 
our ability to increase revenue and achieve and sustain operating profitability also will be affected by other risks and uncertainties described in this section and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to operate profitably on a quarterly or annual basis could have a harmful effect on our business and the value of our common stock 
because our quarterly operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  our operating results in one or more future periods are likely to fluctuate significantly  and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could decline significantly 
as a result of our limited operating history and the emerging and evolving nature of the market in which we compete  our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in the future 
our success depends upon our ability to increase sales of our products and services to our new and existing customers 
our license revenue is comprised substantially of one time license fees 
as a result  we will be required to regularly and increasingly attract and contract with additional customers for substantial license fees on a timely basis to realize comparable or increased license revenue 
our services and maintenance revenue historically has been comprised almost entirely of consulting fees and support and maintenance fees 
our services revenue has a lower gross margin than our license revenue 
to the extent the percentage of our services revenue increases compared to the percentage of license revenue  our profitability would be impaired 
our maintenance contracts are generally renewable for month periods 
if our customers elect not to renew their maintenance contracts or seek to renegotiate price each year  our revenue could decline 
we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations due to a variety of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including introduction of products and services and enhancements by us and our competitors  competitive factors that affect our pricing  the timing and magnitude of our capital expenditures  including costs relating to the management and expansion of our operations within the united states and internationally  the size and timing of customer orders and deployments  particularly large orders  deployments  some of which may represent more than of total revenue during a particular quarter  and costs associated with litigation  legal compliance and corporate events such as reorganizations 
as a result of these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons are not accurate indicators of future performance 
because our staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels  and because a high percentage of our costs are fixed  small variations in the timing of the recognition of specific revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
if we are unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall  any significant revenue shortfall would likely have an immediate negative effect on our operating results 
if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  we would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock 

table of contents if we do not expand our customer base  we may be unable to increase our revenue and our stock price will likely decline 
the market for our software is newly emerging and additional customers may not adopt our products 
accordingly  we cannot accurately estimate the potential demand for our products and services 
we believe that market acceptance of our products and services depends principally on our ability to withstand downturns in general economic conditions or conditions that slow corporate spending on software products  such as the downturn we are currently experiencing in the overall software market  enhance our portal solution to meet changing customer demand  effectively market the enterprise web suite and related products and services  hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing personnel  provide high quality and reliable customer support for our products  distribute and price our products and services to be more appealing to customers than those of our competitors or of our customers internally developed solutions  and develop and maintain a favorable reputation among our customers  potential customers and participants in the software industry who can serve as reference accounts for our products and services 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
if our customer base does not expand  we may never become consistently profitable 
because our quarterly results often depend on a small number of large orders  if we were unable to complete one or more of these orders during any future period  our quarterly operating results and the trading price of our stock could be harmed 
we derive a significant portion of our software license revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders 
for example  in the quarter ended december   our top customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
our operating results and stock price would be harmed if we were unable to complete one or more substantial license sales during any future quarterly period 
our business currently depends on revenue related to our flagship product  the plumtree corporate portal  and if the market does not increasingly accept this product and related products and services  our revenue may decline 
we generate our revenue from licenses of the enterprise web suite and related products and services  including plumtree portlets formerly known as gadget web services  the building blocks from which users assemble a personalized web page  as well as our server products  which provide significant ancillary functionality to our portal platform of the enterprise web suite 
we expect that our enterprise web suite products  and future upgraded versions of these products will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance will depend on increasing acceptance of our current product and on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products 
for example  in june we released version of our portal product 
if new and future versions of our products and services  including version of the plumtree corporate portal and planned future releases of the plumtree corporate portal  such as for java platforms  and planned future updates to our collaboration server and content server  do not gain market acceptance when released commercially  or if we fail to deliver the product enhancements that customers want  demand for our products and services  and our revenue  may decline 

table of contents our sales and implementation cycles are long  unpredictable and subject to seasonal fluctuations  making it difficult to accurately forecast our revenue and causing it to fluctuate  which could harm our operating results 
as a result of our limited operating history  the nature of our products  and the emerging and rapidly evolving nature of the market in which we compete  the typical sales cycle of our portal product is long and unpredictable 
a successful sales cycle may last six to nine months or longer  and typically includes presentations to both business and technical decision makers  often requiring us to expend substantial resources educating prospective customers about the benefits of our software to their business 
the implementation of our product can be time consuming and often involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
our sales cycle is also affected by a number of other factors  some of which we have little or no control over  including the volatility of the overall software market  the business conditions of each prospective customer  seasonal fluctuations as a result of customers fiscal year budgeting and purchasing cycles  and the selection and performance of our technology and of our technology partners  systems integrators and resellers  any of which could harm our operating results 
we depend on technology licensed from third party software developers and our ability to develop and sell our products and services could be delayed or impaired if we fail to maintain these license arrangements 
we incorporate into our products and in certain cases resell third party software that enables  enhances or compliments aspects of our products functionality 
this third party software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or with acceptable levels of support  or at all 
some of these third party software developers offer products that compete with the enterprise web suite and our other products 
our loss of or inability to maintain these software licenses on current terms could delay or impair the sale of our products and services until equivalent software  if available  is identified  licensed or developed  and integrated 
this could adversely affect our business and impair our future growth 
we depend on our direct sales force to sell our products  and if we fail to hire and train new sales personnel  our future growth will be impaired 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend on our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified direct sales personnel 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in recruiting qualified sales personnel 
the complexity of our product and the length of our sales cycle typically results in a lead time of six to nine months or more before newly hired direct sales people become productive and can generate revenue 
our inability to rapidly and effectively expand and train our direct sales force could impair our growth and cause our stock price to fall 
if we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with systems integrators and resellers  our ability to market  sell and deploy our products and services will be harmed 
we have relationships with a large number of systems integrators and resellers  such as booz allen  computer sciences corporation  lexis nexis  lockheed martin  project performance corporation  saic and sra international 
we rely significantly on these parties to market and sell our products and to provide rapid and comprehensive deployment of our products 
these relationships are a key factor in our overall business strategy and involve a number of risks  including systems integrators and resellers may not view their relationships with us as valuable or significant to their own businesses 
the related arrangements typically may be terminated by either party with limited notice and in some cases are not covered by a formal agreement 
under our co deployment model  we often rely on our system integrators and resellers employees to perform implementations 
if we fail to work together effectively  or if these parties perform poorly  our reputation may be harmed and deployment of our products may be delayed or inadequate 

table of contents systems integrators may attempt to market their own products and services rather than ours 
our competitors may have stronger relationships with these parties and  as a result  these system integrators and resellers may recommend a competitor s products and services over ours 
if we lose our relationships with our systems integrators and resellers  we will not have the personnel necessary to deploy our products effectively  and we will need to commit significant additional sales and marketing resources in an effort to reach the markets and customers served by these parties 
if our alliances with technology and content providers are discontinued  our future growth will be impaired 
we have relationships with technology providers  such as sun microsystems  cognos  mediaedge  seec  project performance corporation  stellent  inxight  oblix  bea  handysoft  pivia  thomson publishing  yahoo and documentum  to provide our customers with support of many applications and services 
although these relationships are a key factor in our overall business strategy  our alliance members may not view their relationships with us as significant to their own businesses 
a number of our competitors may have stronger relationships with these or other technology and content vendors and  as a result  these alliance members may be more likely to support our competitors products and services over ours 
in addition  our technology providers may offer products and services that are competitive to ours 
our arrangements generally do not establish minimum performance requirements but instead rely on voluntary efforts 
in addition  most of our agreements with these entities may be terminated by either party with limited notice 
in some cases these arrangements are not covered by a formal agreement 
we currently invest significant resources to develop these alliances and plan to continue to do so 
if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or fail to enter into additional relationships  our ability to increase our sales could be harmed  and we could also lose anticipated customer introductions and co marketing benefits 
even if we succeed in establishing and maintaining these relationships  they may not result in additional customers or revenue 
if our software or software we furnish contains errors  our ability to develop and market our products and services will be harmed and we may lose customers or experience reduced market acceptance of our products 
our software products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only when the product is in use 
we periodically release updated versions of our products  which increases the risk of undetected defects or errors 
it is also possible that our products including the plumtree collaboration server  the plumtree studio server  version of our portal product released in june  upcoming portal product version releases and our server products  may contain undetected defects or errors that are discovered after release 
in addition  third party software that we bundle with  resell or incorporate into our products  or with which we integrate to deploy our solution  has contained  and may in the future contain  defects or errors for which we may become liable 
further  we often render implementation  consulting and other technical services  the performance of which typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and networking systems 
as a result of product defects or our failure to meet project milestones for services  we may lose customers  customers may not implement our products more broadly within their organization  we may experience reduced market acceptance of our products  and we may be subject to product liability claims by our customers such errors or defects may produce a number of risks  including some of our customers require  or may require  enhanced modifications of our software for their specific needs which will divert the attention of our engineering team away from new product developments  upgrades of existing products and other revenue generating developments 
some of our customers may make increasingly frequent and larger demands on our customer care team  overwhelming our support personnel  diverting them from supporting new customers and possibly increasing frustration for most  if not all customers  with respect to technical support response times 

table of contents our consultants may be required to assist in the implementation of software modifications and corrections of errors or defects  thereby reducing our capacity for revenue generating services 
modifications may increase the likelihood of undetected defects or errors and may further drain our engineering  customer care and consulting services resources 
we may lose customers  customers may not implement our products more broadly within their organization  customers may choose not to renew their maintenance contracts with us or they may choose to abandon their projects 
we may lose valuable customer references and our reputation in the industry may diminish  making our sales and marketing efforts more difficult 
we may experience reduced demand for our products  reduced market acceptance of our products and loss of overall competitiveness 
we may be subject to product liability or warranty claims by our customers 
if we are unable to develop products that are compatible and can be integrated with a large variety of hardware  software  database and networking systems  our ability to attract and retain customers will be harmed 
the enterprise web suite is designed to support a broad set of software applications and online services through plumtree portlet web services 
to gain broad market acceptance  and to execute on our strategy of radical openness  we believe that we must support an increased number of operating environments  applications and services in the future 
if the underlying applications and services are upgraded or changed  maintaining this support may be difficult or impossible 
if we are unable to support an increased number of applications and services in the future or if we are unable to maintain compatibility with these systems  our ability to attract and retain customers will be harmed 
furthermore  providers of competitive products and services may cease cooperating with our development efforts to integrate our enterprise web suite with products in their portfolio 
some of our customers are in the preliminary phase of implementing our products and this implementation may not proceed on a timely basis or at all 
some of our customers  such as aflac  allergan  department of health and human services  government of bermuda  hochtief  invitrogen  itt  logica  mercy health services  nisource  ontario ministry of health  and others are currently in a pre deployment or preliminary stage of implementing our products and may encounter delays or other problems in introducing it 
these delays or other problems may result from matters specific to the customer and unrelated to us or our products 
a customer s decision not to implement our product  or a delay in implementation  could result in a delay or loss in related service revenue or otherwise harm our business or prospects 
we cannot predict when or if any customer currently in a pilot or preliminary phase will choose to implement broader use of our products 
if we fail to adequately address our customer support demands  our ability to attract and retain customers will suffer 
we expect that our customers increasingly will demand enhancements to the technical support services we provide 
to meet these demands  we must develop and implement expanded customer support services and programs 
in addition  if we increase our customer base  we expect the demands on our technical support resources to grow rapidly  and we may experience difficulties in responding to customer demand for our services and providing technical support in accordance with our customers expectations 
we expect that these demands will require not only the addition of new management personnel  but also the development of additional expertise by existing personnel and the establishment of long term relationships with third party service vendors 
if we are unable to address these customer demands  our ability to attract and retain customers will suffer 

table of contents security breaches with our software may lead to unexpected capital expenditures and cause a loss in revenue and reputation 
the enterprise web suite is designed to facilitate the secure transmission of sensitive business information to specified parties outside the business over the internet 
this includes product information  competitive intelligence  sales and inventory data  sales reports and corporate e mail 
as a result  the reputation of our software for providing security is vital to its acceptance by customers 
problems caused by security breaches associated with our products or products furnished by us could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of research and development resources  harm to our reputation  customer claims against us  increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
moreover  our products may be even more susceptible to security breaches  since portals and integration framework software require the aggregation of many different web applications on many different servers  with different security standards and protocols 
capacity restrictions of our software could reduce the demand for and use of our products  which may limit our ability to generate license revenue 
our products are designed to support enterprise wide deployments with hundreds of thousands of users 
however  the maximum amount of information and the maximum number of concurrent users that our products can support in any particular deployment is uncertain 
it is also subject to factors outside of our control such as customer architecture 
if the capacity boundaries of our products are reached  our customers may be dissatisfied  and we may lose customers or fail to gain new customers 
moreover  existing customers may seek products with more use capacity and overall demand for our products could decline 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  our growth will be limited 
we are highly dependent on certain members of our management staff  including  without limitation  our chief executive officer  john kunze  and our vice president of engineering  eric zocher 
our vice president of worldwide operations left the company in april and has not yet been replaced 
our ability to continue to deliver products and services that are responsive to customer needs  which is critical to our success  also depends on our ability to retain several members of our management and engineering team 
the loss of one or more of these officers or key engineers may impede the achievement of our business objectives 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term  and no one is constrained from terminating his or her employment relationship with us at any time 
in addition  since a number of our long standing employees have most of their stock options vested  their economic incentive to remain in our employ may be diminished 
if we are unable to recruit and train new personnel  our operations will be disrupted and our growth impaired 
recruiting and retaining qualified technical personnel is critical to our success 
if our business grows  we will also need to recruit a significant number of management  technical and other personnel for our business 
competition for specialized employees in our industry can be intense 
if we are not able to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel on acceptable terms  our growth may be limited due to our limited capacity to develop and market our product 
we are currently recruiting for a vice president of worldwide operations and skilled technical personnel for our professional services group 
it may take an extended period of time to hire a new vice president of worldwide operations and a sufficient number of new technical professionals 
without a senior operations executive in place our sales force may lack direction and our sales process and productivity may suffer 
similarly  we may not be able to meet customer or internal demand for professional services 
once hired  new personnel will need time to familiarize themselves with plumtree and our business practices 
the integration of new personnel has resulted and will continue to result in some disruption to our ongoing operations 
our failure to complete this integration in an efficient manner could harm our business and prospects 

table of contents managing the breadth of our operations will continue to strain managerial  operational and financial resources  and if we are unable to do so our business and operating results could be harmed 
the planned conduct of our operations  coupled with planned increases and reallocations in headcount  will place a significant strain on our management  financial controls  operations systems  personnel and other resources 
our ability to manage our business and achieve growth depends in large part upon a number of factors  including our ability to rapidly build and train our sales and marketing staff to create an effective presence in the evolving corporate portal market  and keep them fully informed over time regarding the technical features  issues and key selling points of our product  attract and retain qualified technical personnel in order to continue to develop reliable and scalable products and services that address evolving customer needs  develop our customer support capacity as sales of our products increase  so that we can provide customer support without diverting resources from product development efforts  and expand our internal management and financial controls significantly  so that we can maintain control over our operations and provide support to other functional areas within plumtree 
our inability to achieve any of these objectives could harm our business and operating results 
we may be unable to manage or grow our international operations  which could impair our overall growth 
we have invested capital and management resources in expanding our international operations  and we are seeking to increase the portion of our revenue that is derived from sources outside the united states 
our revenue from sales outside the united states constituted approximately  and of our total revenue during the years ended december   and  respectively 
if we are unable to continue to grow our international operations  we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset the expenditures required to establish and maintain the international sales and marketing operations  which could slow or undermine our overall growth 
we have committed substantial resources to modify our products for selected international markets  including the united kingdom  france  germany  south korea  australia  italy  spain  brazil  portugal  sweden  taiwan  china  the netherlands and japan 
we expect to continue to commit additional resources to modify our products for other select international markets and to develop our international sales and support organization 
however  even if we successfully expand our international operations and successfully modify our products  we may be unable to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including costs of modifying our products for foreign countries  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations  including taxes  intellectual property  securities and employment laws  increased reliance on systems integrators and resellers abroad  longer sales cycles  import and export restrictions and tariffs  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  greater difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights  and greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection 

table of contents in consultation with our advisors  we have structured our operations so that certain international license contracts between certain foreign customers and our swiss subsidiary  plumtree software gmbh are not subject to tax at source 
there is a risk that local jurisdictions may challenge the characterization of these transactions 
in the event these transactions are challenged by local tax authorities the process would divert management attention and resources  and we may incur substantial costs 
if we fail to comply with complex and changing tax requirements some tax authorities may seek to collect applicable taxes from our customers and we may in turn become subject to claims by our customers seeking reimbursement for any tax assessed 
product liability claims could divert management s attention and be costly to defend 
our license agreements with customers and arrangements with our systems integrators and technology vendors typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
not all domestic and international jurisdictions may enforce these limitations 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we may encounter this type of claim in the future 
product liability claims brought against us  whether or not successful  could divert the attention and resources of our management and key personnel  could be costly to defend and could require us to pay significant monetary damages or impair our ability to market our products 
if we are unable to effectively protect our proprietary rights  our competitors may be able to copy important aspects of our products or product presentations  which would undermine the relative appeal of our products to customers and reduce our sales 
we believe that proprietary rights are important to our business 
we have no issued patents 
we have filed eleven non provisional patent applications with the us patent and trademark office and four international patent applications with the world intellectual property organization 
however  current or future patent applications may not be granted  and it is possible that any patents issued to us may be circumvented by our competitors or otherwise may not provide significant protection or commercial advantage to us 
similarly  our trademark  service mark and copyright rights may not provide significant protection or commercial advantage to us  and the measures we take to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets may not be effective 
on november   we commenced an action in the district court in the hague against an individual  werner linssen  to cancel the benelux trademark registration for plumtree held by mr 
linssen

those proceedings have been suspended pending disposition of the benelux action in the hague 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software product or technology without authorization 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the united states 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and alliance members  control access to our source code and other proprietary technology and limit distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
these measures afford only limited protection and may be inadequate 
others may develop noninfringing technologies that are similar or superior to our own 
if our products employ technology that infringes the proprietary rights of others  we may be subject to infringement claims  forced to pay high prices to license technology or required to stop selling our products 
we expect that software products  including ours  may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments expands and overlaps 
third parties may claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
regardless of whether these claims have any merit  they could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert our management s attention and resources  require us to indemnify technology vendors  system integrators or customers  require us to refund license fees  cause product shipment delays  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  or result in court orders limiting our ability to license our products 
on may  datamize llc filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the district of montana civil action no 
m lbe alleging  in general  that by supplying software and systems for the personalization and customization of networked kiosk and computer screens  we infringe us patent number  the patent owned by datamize 
datamize  based in florence  montana described itself in its complaint as engaged in the business of designing  creating and commercially exploiting software useful in the personalization and customization of networked kiosk and computer screens 
datamize was seeking  among other things  injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
we filed a motion motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction  or in the alternative  have the action transferred to the northern district of california 
in early july  the court granted the motion and entered judgment in favor of us on july  in accordance with that order 
datamize had thirty days to appeal this judgment  which period elapsed on august  without datamize taking any action with the court 
in december  we filed a complaint for declaratory relief against datamize in us district court for the northern district of california civil action no 
vrw 
we seek a declaratory judgment that it does not infringe any valid claim of the patent  which datamize claims to own 
datamize has filed its answer and a counterclaim alleging that we infringe the patent 
datamize is seeking  among other things  injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
in response to a procedural motion  the court realigned the parties 
table of contents so that we are now the defendant  and datamize is now the plaintiff 
the parties are engaging in discovery  and construction of the patent claims 
no trial date has been set  although the final pretrial conference is scheduled for march  based on other communications by datamize s counsel  we expect datamize may take further legal action against us with respect to additional intellectual property that datamize purportedly owns or will own in the future 
at this time  we do not believe we infringe on any valid patent claim of datamize and we intend to pursue vigorously available claims and defenses 
a successful claim of infringement against us or our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could damage our business to the extent that we are required to pay substantial monetary damages or if  as result of a successful claim  we became unable to sell our products without redeveloping them or otherwise were forced to incur significant additional expenses 
we may be subject to misappropriation claims by former employers of our personnel  which could be costly and disruptive to our business 
from time to time  we hire or retain employees or consultants who have worked for independent software vendors or other companies developing products similar to those offered by us 
those prior employers may claim that our products are based on their products and that we have misappropriated their intellectual property 
any claims of that variety  with or without merit  could cause a significant diversion of management attention  result in costly and protracted litigation  cause product shipment delays  require us to indemnify our alliance members and customers  require us to refund license fees or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
those royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could harm our business 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business and management due to difficulties in assimilating personnel  acquired products and technology and operations and may dilute stockholder value 
we have made  and in the future may make acquisitions or investments in other companies or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions or investments we undertake 
for instance  we made three small acquisitions in late acquisitions such as these require us to assimilate the operations  products  technology and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
if we consummate acquisitions through an exchange of our securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  or undisclosed liabilities of the acquired business 
finally  the terms of our existing contractual obligations may restrict or prohibit acquisitions that we may seek to consummate 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we may be unable to obtain these funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the development and expansion of our business will require significant capital to fund our operating expenses  working capital needs and capital expenditures 
during the next months  we expect to meet our cash requirements with existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  cash flow from sales of our product and services and proceeds from existing and future working capital lines of credit and other borrowings 
our failure to generate sufficient cash flows from sales of products and services or to raise sufficient funds may require us to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities 
future equity or debt financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
the terms of our existing loan agreement with silicon valley bank limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional 
table of contents indebtedness 
future borrowing instruments  such as credit facilities and lease agreements  are also likely to contain restrictive covenants and will likely require us to pledge assets as security for borrowings under those future arrangements 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
our inability to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms may result in a delay or failure to develop and enhance our products  acquire new technologies or businesses  expand operations and hire and train employees 
risks relating to our industry intense competition and consolidation in our industry could limit our ability to attract and retain customers 
the market for our products is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  and new product introductions and improvements 
our current competitors include established software vendors that are web enabling their applications or are building infrastructure software  emerging companies offering competitive products and companies choosing to build their own solutions 
some of our large competitors may expand their competitive product offerings through acquisitions 
for example  sap expanded its competitive offerings through its acquisition of toptier in march  vignette acquired epicentric  inc in december  open text corporation acquired corechange  inc in february  webmethods acquired certain assets of data channel in october  and vignette acquired intraspect in december many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition  a broader range of products and a larger installed customer base  any of which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  new competitors  or alliances among existing and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
some of our competitors  particularly established software vendors  may also be able to provide customers with products and services comparable to ours at lower or at aggressively reduced prices in an effort to increase market share or as part of a broader software package they are selling to a customer 
we may be unable to match competitors prices or price reductions  and we may fail to win customers that choose to purchase a portal solution as part of a broader software and services package 
if we cannot compete successfully against current and future competitors  we may be unable to attract and retain customers 
increased competition could also result in price reductions for our products and lower profit margins and reduced market share  any of which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
downturns in the software market may decrease our revenue and margins 
the market for our products is affected by economic conditions of the broader software market 
downturns in the economy may cause businesses and governments to delay or cancel corporate portal projects  reduce their overall information technology budgets or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
in this environment  customers may experience financial difficulty  fail to or defer the budget for the purchase of our products or cease operations 
this  in turn  may lead to longer sales cycles  delays or failures in payment and collection  and price pressures  causing us to realize lower revenues and margins 
in particular  capital spending in the information technology sector generally has decreased in most of the past months  and many of our customers and potential customers have experienced severe declines in their revenues and operations 
we believe that  in light of these events  some businesses and governments may curtail or eliminate capital spending on information technology 
if capital spending in our markets declines  it may be necessary for us to gain significant market share from our competitors in order to achieve our financial goals or to sustain annual or quarterly profitability 
our failure to introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner will make market acceptance of our products less likely 
new products  platforms and language support can require long development and testing periods 
any delays in developing and releasing new products could harm our business 
new products or enhancements may 
table of contents not be released according to schedule or may contain defects when released 
version of the plumtree corporate portal  the plumtree collaboration server  plumtree studio server and plumtree content server have been recently released commercially  increasing the risk of undetected defects or errors 
efforts to correct any such errors or defects could divert our engineers from or delay development of new products 
our efforts to develop and release new products  such as the planned version j java of the plumtree corporate portal  and applications  such as dashboard and score carding with cognos  an enterprise web customer service application for insurers with seec and an electronic courtroom management application with mediaedge  could be delayed or hindered by development problems 
product release delays or product defects  could result in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
we may be unable to successfully develop and market product enhancements or new products that respond to technological changes  shifting customer tastes or evolving industry standards  and may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner  or if we experience delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products and enhancements  our ability to attract and retain customers will be harmed 
if we fail to manage technological change  demand for our products and services will drop and our revenue will decline 
the market for our products is still in an early stage of development and is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new service and product introductions and changes in customer demands 
our future success will depend to a substantial degree on our ability to offer products and services that incorporate leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
you should be aware that our technology or systems may become obsolete upon the introduction of alternative technologies  the technological life cycles of our products may end abruptly and  in any event  are difficult to estimate  we may not have sufficient resources to develop or acquire new technologies or to introduce new services capable of competing with future technologies or service offerings  and the price of the products and services we provide may decline as rapidly as  or more rapidly than  the price of any competitive alternatives  particularly if the unique features of our products become widely adopted through new technologies 
we may not be able to effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market for corporate portals 
to the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of those technologies and equipment are likely to continue to require significant capital investment by us 
we may not have sufficient capital for these purposes in the future 
even if we successfully raise capital to develop new technologies  investments in these technologies may not result in commercially viable technological processes  or there may not be commercial applications for those technologies 
if we do not develop and introduce new products and services  and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner  demand for our products and services will drop and our revenue will decline 
terrorist activities and resulting military and other actions could harm our business 
terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc in september of and the war in iraq disrupted commerce throughout the world 
the continued threat of terrorism and continued military action and heightened security measures in response to this threat have caused and may continue to cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that these continued disruptions result in a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
we are unable to predict whether these threats or the responses thereto will result in any long 
table of contents term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have a long term adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  if any attacks were to affect the operation of the internet or key data centers  our business could be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
our investment portfolio consists of money market funds  corporate backed debt obligations  municipal bonds and us government discount notes  generally due within one to two years 
we place investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risks 
based on the duration of our portfolio and our ability to hold investments to maturity  we believe that  if a significant change in interest rates were to occur  it would not have a material effect on our financial condition  although there can be no assurance of this 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets  most of which are denominated in various currencies 
as a result  our operating results are and may become subject to more significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuation and evaluate the benefits of implementing a hedging strategy to mitigate our foreign exchange risks 
we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not affect adversely our financial results in the future
