overview the year ended december  was a challenging year for the travel industry and pegasus 
the weak economic climate in the united states  the war in iraq and the continuing threat of terrorism resulted in a decrease in the demand for hotel rooms and  therefore  negatively impacted our revenues 
in addition  financial crises in the airline industry and severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  negatively impacted the hospitality industry and pegasus in these events had the most impact on our representation service  which also experienced increased competition from lower cost distribution channels domestically 
offsetting these revenue declines  our revenues were favorably impacted by million due to stronger foreign currencies than what had been experienced in the prior year  particularly the euro and the british pound 
in june  we began to see a gradual recovery in transaction volume but did not notice improving average daily rates 
we were able to offset a large portion of the revenue decline by reducing our expenses 
we began realizing synergies from our strategic integration during the third quarter of  and we had strict controls over discretionary spending such as advertising  marketing and travel during the entire year 
despite the revenue decline  a more efficient cost structure allowed pegasus to invest in initiatives that we believe position the company well for producing new business when travel returns to higher levels 
late in  we discovered stability issues with our property management system pegasuscentral 
using both internal and external resources  we performed a diagnostic review and a detailed root cause analysis 
together with our consultant in this process  we have determined that by remediating a small percentage of the code we could correct the significant issues impacting our customers  and that by developing additional functionality we could significantly improve our product offering 
for intercontinental hotels group  our largest pegasuscentral customer  we currently expect to complete software upgrades of the existing installed base during the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we expect to deliver an enhanced version of pegasuscentral based on customer requirements  perform acceptance testing and resume installations at new hotel properties 
pegasuscentral has not yet contributed a material amount of revenues 
however  we still believe this service will contribute to the long term growth of pegasus and are committed to delivering a stable product that meets our customers expectations 
dependence on the hotel industry our business is sensitive to changes in the demand for  and average daily rates associated with  hotel rooms 
historically  after periods of low demand for hotel rooms  average daily rates have lagged behind the recovery in transaction volumes 
since our distribution and reservation services revenues are primarily transaction based  revenues for these services have recovered more quickly than our hotel representation and financial services  which are based in large part on a combination of reservation volume and average daily rates 
in addition  we have experienced a lengthening in the sales cycle for some of our services  as new customers are hesitant to sign new contracts in an uncertain economic environment 

table of contents revenues representation services 
we offer a variety of hotel representation services to independent hotels and small hotel groups 
representation services revenues consist of reservation processing fees  membership fees and fees for various marketing services 
in addition  the paytell service allows international travelers  who book rooms at hotels for which we provide representation services  to prepay for their hotel rooms in the hotel s local currency 
when a traveler arrives at the hotel  pegasus remits the amount to the hotel in the hotel s local currency 
revenues for this service are derived from transaction fees and the difference in the exchange rate between the date the traveler pays and the date the guest stay occurs 
representation services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for reservation services 
we provide crs services on an application service provider  or asp  basis 
reservation services revenues consist of transaction fees as well as license  maintenance and support fees related to our rezview crs software 
reservation services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for financial services 
our financial services offering provides comprehensive commission processing and payment solutions to hotels  other travel suppliers and travel agencies 
financial services revenues consist of both travel agency and hotel fees 
travel agency fees are based on a percentage of the value of hotel commissions processed by pegasus on behalf of participating travel agencies 
revenues from travel agency fees can vary substantially from period to period based on the demand for hotel rooms  the types of hotels such as upscale or economy at which reservations are made and fluctuations in overall room rates 
in addition  participating hotels generally pay fees based on the number of commissionable transactions that pegasus processes for the hotel 
financial services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for distribution services 
our distribution services provide the connections and interfaces that enable hotels to distribute their rates and inventory to and receive reservations from the four gdss used by travel agencies worldwide  a growing number of four operators  wholesalers  and a variety of powered by pegasus sites 
during distribution services processed approximately million transactions 
distribution services revenues primarily consist of transaction fees  commissions and monthly subscription or maintenance fees 
in addition  new hotel customers typically pay a one time fee for establishing the connection between the hotel s central reservation system and the electronic distribution technology 
new third party internet site customers typically pay a one time fee for establishing the connection between the third party internet site and our electronic distribution technology  which is amortized over the related contract period 
distribution services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for property services 
property services revenues primarily consist of maintenance and support fees related to legacy pmss acquired from rez and gets 
in addition  property services revenues include fees from our pegasuscentral pms  which are recognized monthly 
property services represented approximately percent of service revenues for other services 
pegasus regularly seeks to develop new services to capitalize on its existing technology and customer base and to provide additional electronic hotel reservation capabilities and information services to its existing customers and to other participants in the travel distribution process 
pegasus has not received a material amount of revenue from these services  and there can be no assurance that any of these services will produce a material amount of revenue in the future 
customer reimbursements 
revenues applicable to customer reimbursements are primarily related to gds fees that we pay on behalf of and subsequently bill our customers 
in the future  if our customers decide to pay their bills directly  our customer reimbursements revenue and customer reimbursements cost of services will decrease accordingly 
the classification of service revenues and customer reimbursements has been reflected in the financial statements to give effect to the adoption of the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf 
under eitf  pegasus billings for out of pocket expenses  such as third party vendor 
table of contents gds and telecommunication charges  are classified as customer reimbursements  which is a component of total revenues  and the related costs are classified as customer reimbursements  which is a component of total costs of services 
the adoption of eitf had no effect on our financial position  operating loss or cash flows 
costs pegasus costs of services consist principally of personnel costs relating to information technology  customer service and telemarketing  facilities  and equipment maintenance costs 
costs of services also include the cost of customer reimbursements 
research and development costs consist principally of personnel costs  related overhead costs and fees paid to outside consultants 
general and administrative expenses are primarily personnel  legal and accounting related  and certain facilities costs 
marketing and promotion expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising  public relations and participation in trade shows and other industry events 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of computer equipment  office furniture  office equipment and leasehold improvements  as well as amortization of software and intangible assets 
interest income primarily includes income earned on the company s investments 
interest expense primarily includes interest and amortization of capitalized issuance costs related to the million convertible debt offering 
fluctuation of foreign currencies pegasus derives a significant portion of its revenue from customers located outside the united states 
particularly in europe  fluctuations of foreign currencies such as the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar result in pegasus earning more or less revenue and expending more or less in expenses than it otherwise might have earned if currency rates had remained stable 
recent developments strategic integration plan previously  our services were organized into two business segments technology and hospitality 
during  we completed a strategic reorganization to integrate our technology and hospitality segments into one operating unit 
as a result  we have integrated support functions  including sales and marketing  product development  service delivery  reservation data management  information technology  finance and human resources functions 
the integration plan continues our existing strategy of better aligning our businesses with our customers needs  thus allowing for future revenue growth and the realization of further synergies as one fully integrated company 
because we have changed our management approach  organizational structure  operating performance assessment and reporting  and operational decision making from a segment perspective technology and hospitality to a single company perspective  we do not report separate segment information

table of contents our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our profitability operational cash requirements  including payments for severance and redundant facilities related to our restructuring competitive pressures development of new services and applications acquisition of and investment in complementary businesses or technologies common stock repurchases response to unanticipated cash requirements we believe that the company s financial condition is strong and that its cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
although we do not expect to raise any external capital in the next year  pegasus could in the future consider other financing alternatives to fund its requirements  including possible public or private debt or equity offerings 
however  there can be no assurance that any financing alternatives sought by pegasus will be available or will be on terms that are attractive to pegasus 
further  any debt financing may involve restrictive covenants  and any equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders 
inflation pegasus does not believe that inflation has materially impacted results of operations during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on its results of operations to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers 
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported financial position and results of operations during the reporting period 
our estimates and judgments are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from estimates 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it will likely result in a material adverse impact to our business  operating results and financial condition 
certain accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
pegasus considers the following to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
for a detailed discussion of pegasus accounting policies  including recently issued accounting standards  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates  and the disclosure in this section of this report regarding them  with our audit committee 
accounts and notes receivables as of december   pegasus had accounts receivable as a result of its ongoing operations of approximately million 
additionally  pegasus has notes receivable totaling million at december   related to the sale of business units 
these receivables are monitored by management for collectibility 
pegasus maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimates of losses require judgments that are based on available information and experience  such as the payment histories and known financial conditions of the parties 
these estimates are significant because pegasus may incur additional expense to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts and may receive less cash than expected if the financial condition of the parties was to deteriorate  
table of contents resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
pegasus allowances for doubtful accounts totaled approximately million as of december  impairment of assets as of december   pegasus has goodwill totaling approximately million related to its acquisitions of rez in  gets in and unirez in under the guidance of fas  goodwill is periodically analyzed for impairment 
these practices require significant estimates and judgments by management  involving the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the company 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment in estimating future cash flows from operations for the various services provided by pegasus 
while the most recent periodic impairment analysis indicated that no impairment of goodwill exists  variances in actual growth rates  operating margins  or other assumptions may impact future impairment analyses and affect the carrying values of goodwill 
as of december   pegasus has unamortized capitalized software costs totaling million  which we review periodically for impairment 
this impairment analysis requires the comparison of unamortized carrying values to estimated net realizable values 
the estimated net realizable value is based on significant judgments such as estimated future cash flows from the related services  or expected benefits of the software and are based on available information and experience 
while the most recent periodic impairment analyses indicated that no impairment of capitalized software costs exists  changes in strategy  market conditions or other assumptions may significantly impact these judgments and affect the carrying values of capitalized software costs 
employee benefit plans in the united states and the united kingdom  pegasus sponsors defined benefit plans for certain employees 
our employee pension costs and obligations are dependent upon our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
the salary growth assumptions are either stated in the plan or reflect our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical results of the portfolio and management s expectation of the current economic environment 
specific to the plan provided in the united kingdom  which is a funded plan  a one percent change in expected returns on plan assets would result in a  change to pegasus annual expense associated with this plan 
we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields  including applicable corporate long term bond yields 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future working life of the plan participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension costs and obligations 
additionally  the recent changes in pegasus executive management could have an effect on the assumptions used in accounting for our us defined benefit plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pegasus is exposed to certain market risks  including the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates  and uses derivative financial instrument contracts to manage foreign exchange risks 
pegasus has established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
company policy prohibits holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows  pegasus was a party to various forward exchange contracts at december  these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily trade receivables and payables 

table of contents a summary of forward exchange contracts in place at december  follows in thousands sell purchase euro swedish krona british pound japanese yen swiss franc canadian dollar singapore dollar hong kong dollar australian dollar south african rand norwegian krona czech krone danish krone new zealand dollar total all contracts matured no later than february because of the short term nature of these contracts  the fair value approximates the contract value 
the difference between the fair value and contract value is included in the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and was not material at december  during the fiscal year ended december   pegasus used similar forward exchange contracts and had either sell or purchase forward exchange contracts of a similarly short term nature in place on december  as of december   pegasus had approximately million in sell forward exchange contracts and  in purchase forward exchange contracts 
pegasus positions with respect to these forward exchange contracts differed as of december  compared to december  because of changes in pegasus non us denominated trade payables and receivables
