item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page and within the note to consolidated financial statements beginning on page growth initiatives toys r us toy box in  we began testing a concept called toys r us toy box in a limited number of grocery stores 
the toy box concept consists of approximately to linear feet of space containing an assortment of smaller toy items with price points generally below in  we signed a multi year deal with albertson s  inc to become the exclusive toy provider for its food and drug stores 
under the agreement  toys r us will have a permanent branded and  in some cases  a non branded presence year round in these store locations 
the branded presence of toys r us will be executed via this store within a store concept 
our goal is to use this concept to offer guests a compelling selection of popular toys at the place where  we believe  they shop most frequently  grocery stores 
at january   we had opened approximately toy sections across albertson s  inc store locations 
we expect to complete the rollout in the first half of  when we expect to have approximately  toy sections in albertson s  inc store locations 
geoffrey stores in  we opened four geoffrey stores in the united states  including conversions of two existing toys r us stores 
these stores combine elements of toys r us  babies r us  and apparel in a  to  square foot format 
these stores also incorporate new concepts such as party rooms  activity centers  haircut and styling salons  photo studios  and play areas 
in  we incorporated certain geoffrey elements into existing toys r us us stores 
we plan to open one new geoffrey store in 
table of contents strategic evaluation we are currently in the process of conducting a thorough strategic evaluation of all of our worldwide assets and operations to determine the optimal configuration and use of our resources 
we have retained credit suisse first boston llc as our financial advisor to assist us in this process 
we have also retained experts in appropriate disciplines to provide appraisals of our real estate assets and other holdings 
the fact finding phase of the evaluation is underway 
once we have gathered all of the necessary valuations and other relevant information  management will begin a process of reviewing all of the strategic alternatives and make its recommendations to the board of directors 
we anticipate that this review process will be completed later in financial information about industry segments information about industry segments is set forth within the note to the consolidated financial statements entitled segments beginning on page distribution centers in the united states  our stores are supported by distribution centers  which average approximately  square feet in size  and are strategically located throughout the united states to efficiently support our stores 
we also operate eight international distribution centers that support our international toy stores 
these distribution centers employ warehouse management systems and material handling equipment that help to minimize overall inventory levels and distribution costs 
certain product processing and ticketing activities are performed at the distribution centers in order to improve store labor efficiency  thereby allowing store employees to concentrate on guest service and store presentation 
we believe the flexibility afforded by our warehouse distribution system and by the ownership of a majority of our fleet of trucks used to distribute merchandise provides us with operating efficiencies and the ability to maintain a better in stock inventory position at our stores 
we are currently implementing initiatives to improve our supply chain management and to optimize our inventory assortment 
we are also expanding our automated replenishment system to improve inventory turnover 
trademarks toys r us  babies r us  imaginarium  and geoffrey  as well as variations of our family of r us marks  either have been registered  or have trademark applications pending  with the united states patent and trademark office and with the trademark registries of many foreign countries 
we believe that our rights to these properties are adequately protected 
risks associated with our business seasonality our worldwide toy business is highly seasonal with net sales and earnings highest in the fourth quarter 
during the last three fiscal years  more than of the net sales from our worldwide toy business and a substantial portion of the operating earnings and cash flows from operations were generated in the fourth quarter 
our results of operations depend significantly upon the holiday selling season in the fourth quarter 
if less than satisfactory net sales  operating earnings or cash flows from operations are achieved during the key fourth quarter  we may not be able to compensate sufficiently for the lower net sales  operating earnings  or cash flows from operations during the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
our babies r us business is not significantly impacted by seasonality 

table of contents for further detail regarding the seasonal nature of our business  refer to the tabular presentation in the quarterly results of financial operations section at the end of item on page liquidity and capital requirements we have significant liquidity and capital requirements 
among other things  the seasonality of our toy business requires us to purchase merchandise well in advance of the holiday selling season 
we depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations as well as borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facilities to finance the carrying costs of this inventory  to pay for capital expenditures  and to maintain operations 
standard poor s and moody s rate our debt as non investment grade 
there is a risk that these ratings may be lowered again in the future 
our current credit ratings could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms  have the effect of increasing our financing costs  and have the effect of slightly increasing our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our self insured programs 
we currently have adequate sources of funds to provide for our ongoing operations and capital requirements  however  any inability to have future access to financing  when needed  could have a negative effect on the financial condition and results of our operations 
for a discussion of our liquidity and capital resource requirements  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page competition the retailing industry is highly competitive and our results of operations are sensitive to  and may be adversely affected by  competitive pricing  promotional pressures  additional competitor store openings  and other factors 
we compete with discount and mass merchandisers  such as wal mart  target  and kmart  electronic retailers  such as best buy and circuit city  national and regional chains  as well as local retailers in the market areas we serve 
competition is principally based on price  store location  advertising and promotion  product selection  quality  and service 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources  lower merchandise acquisition costs  and lower operating expenses than our company 
if we fail to compete successfully  we could face lower net sales and may decide to offer greater discounts to our guests  which could result in decreased profitability 
most of the merchandise we sell is also available from various retailers at competitive prices 
discount and mass merchandisers use aggressive pricing policies and enlarged toy selling areas during the holiday season to build traffic for other store departments 
we seek to address these competitive tactics and attract more guests by continually building brand image and by offering exclusive products  high value items  and the best available selection of toys and toy related products relative to the discount and mass merchandisers 
in addition  competition in the retail apparel business consists of national and local department stores  specialty and discount store chains  as well as internet and catalog businesses 
our apparel business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to less than optimal selection as a result of these factors 
we review our merchandise assortments in order to identify slow moving items and use markdowns to clear such inventory 
strategic initiatives we continue to implement a series of guest oriented strategic programs designed to differentiate and strengthen our core merchandise content and service levels 
we are also continuing with plans to reduce and optimize our operating expense structure 
the success of these plans will depend on various factors including the appeal of renovated store formats  our ability to offer new products to guests  and competitive and economic conditions 
if we are unsuccessful at implementing some or all of our strategic initiatives  we may be unable to retain or attract guests  which could result in lower net sales and a failure to realize the benefit of the sizeable expenditures incurred for these initiatives 
also refer to the section entitled strategic evaluation on page 
table of contents consumer preferences our financial performance depends on our ability to identify  originate  and define product trends  as well as to anticipate  gauge  and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner 
our toy and other products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change 
we cannot guarantee our ability to continue to meet changing consumer demands in the future 
if we misjudge the market for our products  we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products 
in addition  because we place orders for products well in advance of purchases by guests  we could experience excess inventory if our guests purchase fewer products than anticipated 
the retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by fashion  perceived value  and season 
these fluctuations affect the merchandise in stock since purchase orders are made well in advance of the season and  at times  before fashion trends and high demand brands are evidenced by consumer purchases 
consumer spending sales of toys and other products may depend upon discretionary consumer spending  which may be affected by general economic conditions  consumer confidence  and other factors beyond our control 
a decline in consumer spending could  among other things  negatively affect our net sales and could also result in excess inventories  which could in turn lead to increased inventory financing expenses 
as a result  changes in consumer spending patterns could adversely affect our profitability 
age compression trend toy sales may be negatively impacted by age compression  which is the acceleration of children abandoning traditional toy categories at increasingly younger ages for more sophisticated products  such as cell phones  dvd players  cd players  mp devices  and other electronic products 
the age compression pattern tends to decrease consumer demand for traditional toys 
to the extent that we cannot offer guests more sophisticated products or that the more sophisticated items are also available at a wider range of retailers than our traditional competitors  our sales and profitability could be detrimentally affected and we could experience excess inventories 
vendor relationships we have more than  vendor relationships through which we procure the merchandise that we offer to guests 
for  our top vendors  based on our purchase volume  represented approximately of the total products we purchased 
the concentration of goods coming from a limited number of vendors could negatively affect our business if our relationship deteriorated with this group of vendors 
if we were unable to negotiate reasonable terms to acquire merchandise from this group of vendors and then fail to obtain similar products from alternative sources  our net sales and profitability would be negatively affected 
product sourcing a significant portion of the toys and other products sold by us are manufactured outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
as a result  any event causing a disruption of imports  including the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or otherwise  acts of war  or terrorism could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us  which could  in turn  negatively affect our net sales and profitability 
internet operations the success of our on line business depends on our ability to provide quality service to our internet guests and on our strategic alliance with amazon 
com  inc if our relationship with amazon 
com  inc 
deteriorated in a material way  it could have a negative impact on our on line business 
if our strategic alliance ended and we were 
table of contents unable to provide the same level of website and fulfillment services ourselves or through another third party  our net sales and profitability would be negatively affected 
information technology systems we depend upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our operations 
we are in the process of upgrading the inventory management  distribution and supply chain management systems  our point of sale systems  as well as other essential information technology 
we spent approximately million in each of the last three years on information technology 
implementation of new systems and enhancements to existing systems could cause disruptions in our operations 
if our major information systems fail to perform as anticipated  we could experience difficulties in replenishing inventories or in delivering toys and other products to store locations in response to consumer demands 
any of these or other systems related problems could  in turn  adversely affect our net sales and profitability 
employees at january   we employed approximately  full time and part time individuals 
due to the seasonality of our business  we employed approximately  full time and part time employees during the holiday season

we operate all of our retail stores in the united states  as well as approximately of our branded retail stores internationally 
as of january   there were  r us branded retail stores operating worldwide in the following formats toys r us specialty toy stores throughout the united states  including four geoffrey stores  offering toy  baby juvenile  and children s clothing products  international toys r us specialty toy stores  of which are licensed or franchised  babies r us specialty baby juvenile stores in the united states  and kids r us children s clothing stores  all of which will close during the first half of in addition to the above  we sell merchandise through our internet sites at www

opportunities  challenges  and risks as a worldwide retailer of specialty goods  we are faced with significant opportunities  as well as challenges and risks 
we believe our major opportunities are as follows babies r us growth we believe that continued growth opportunities exist in the united states for babies r us 
we opened babies r us stores in the united states in and operated stores in the united states as of january  we plan to open approximately additional stores in the united states in international growth we believe that growth opportunities exist outside of the united states for the toys r us store format 
during  toys r us stores were opened internationally  of which six are operated by us 
we plan to open approximately additional toys r us stores internationally in  of which approximately nine will be operated by us 
in addition  toys r us japan  an equity investee of ours  operated three babies r us stores as of january  and plans to open six additional babies r us stores in japan in new business opportunities we continue to develop our newest businesses  geoffrey and toy box  and continue to focus on new business ideas to maximize assets and shareholder value 
strategic evaluation we are currently in the process of conducting a thorough strategic evaluation of all of our assets and operations in order to determine the optimal configuration and use of these resources 
we expect this process to be completed during we believe the following are our principal challenges and risks  predominantly for our toys r us us division increased competition our businesses operate in a highly and increasingly competitive retail market 
we compete with discount and mass merchandisers  national and regional chains and department stores  local retailers in the market areas we serve  and internet and catalog businesses 
we compete on the 
table of contents basis of selection  variety and availability of product  guest service  and price 
price competition in the united states toy retailing business was extremely intense during the holiday season 
leading discounters elected to sell a number of the season s most popular toys below our invoice cost for these items 
in order to protect our market share  we elected to match the discounters prices in many cases 
although we believe we were successful in maintaining market share in the core toy categories  our margins and operating profits were adversely impacted during the holiday season 
currently  the leading discounters are estimated to account for less than of total sales in the united states toy market  however  as their share increases  we are likely to experience ongoing pricing pressures 
we believe that success in this competitive environment can be achieved through enhancing the shopping experience for our guests  superior inventory management  close cooperation with vendors  strengthening brand loyalty  and competitive pricing 
we also continue to focus on strengthening our relationships with our vendors 
spending patterns and age compression toy sales may be negatively impacted by age compression  which is the acceleration of children leaving traditional play categories at increasingly younger ages for more sophisticated products such as cell phones  dvd players  cd players  mp devices  and other electronic products 
the age compression pattern tends to decrease consumer demand for traditional toys 
to the extent that we cannot offer consumers more sophisticated products or that these more sophisticated items are also available at a wider range of retailers than our traditional competitors  our sales and profitability could be detrimentally affected and we could experience excess inventories 
video game business the video game category is a significant piece of our worldwide toy store business 
over the course of a video cycle  from release of a video platform until the release of the next generation of video platforms  video games have tended to account for of our domestic toy store sales 
the peak of the current cycle occurred in when video represented more than of domestic toy sales for the year 
we have seen significant declines in sales in this category during the last two years  primarily as a result of price deflation on video game platforms released in  as well as the impact of the maturation of this category 
in addition  competition in the video game market has increased as the discounters have expanded and specialty players  such as best buy  electronics boutique and gamestop  have all experienced significant growth 
the next significant video game platform release is not expected to occur until  therefore  it is likely that our video sales will decline again in we will continue to focus on having the best available selection for children and families 
seasonality our worldwide toy store business is highly seasonal with net sales and earnings highest in the fourth quarter 
during the last three fiscal years  more than of the net sales from our worldwide toy store business and a substantial portion of the operating earnings and cash flows from operations were generated in the fourth quarter 
our results of operations depend significantly upon the holiday selling season in the fourth quarter 
if less than satisfactory net sales  operating earnings or cash flows from operations are achieved during the key fourth quarter  we may not be able to compensate sufficiently for the lower net sales  operating earnings  or cash flows from operations during the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
our babies r us business is not significantly impacted by seasonality 
results of operations consolidated net earnings were million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january   million  or per diluted share  for the year ended february   and million  or per diluted share  for the year ended february  our consolidated financial statements were impacted by the implementation of emerging issues task force issue no

the decline in sales for and in the toys r us us division was primarily due to a decrease in net sales of video game products which decreased in and in the decline in our video game business for both and is the result of price deflation of video game hardware  as well as the maturation of the most current video game platforms released in microsoft x box

for  the toys r us us division reported a decline of in gross margin  to of net sales 
the declines in gross margin for the toys r us us division for and were primarily attributable to higher inventory markdowns  both for competitive purposes during the highly promotional and competitive fourth quarters of both years  and to manage inventory levels during these periods 
the declines in gross margin for the toys r us us division in and were offset by increases in gross margin from other divisions in both years

we record the costs associated with operating our distribution network as a part of consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a  including those costs that primarily relate to transporting merchandise from distribution centers to stores 
therefore  our consolidated gross margin may not be comparable to the gross margin of other retailers that include similar costs in their cost of sales

these increases were partially offset by the impact of closed stores

other foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on our consolidated net earnings for and and had a favorable impact on our operating earnings for the international division of in and in inflation did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings in  or restructuring and other charges on november   we announced our decision to close all of our free standing kids r us stores and all of our free standing imaginarium stores  as well as three distribution centers that support these stores 
these free standing stores incurred significant performance declines in the past few years 
this accelerated deterioration in financial performance led to our decision to cease operations in these free standing stores 
while we continue to expand our apparel business and imaginarium boutiques within our toys r us and babies r us stores  we believe that ceasing operations in the free standing kids r us and imaginarium stores will have a favorable impact on future cash flows and net earnings 
as of january   all of the free standing imaginarium stores were closed 
most of the leases have been terminated  with the remaining terminations under negotiation 
of the kids r us facilities were closed on or before january   and the remaining locations will close during the first half of we plan to convert up to of the former kids r us locations to babies r us stores over the next two years 
in addition  five former kids r us stores had leases that ended on january  on march   we entered into an agreement with office depot  inc under which office depot  inc 
has agreed to acquire of the former kids r us stores for million in cash  before commissions and fees  plus the assumption of 
table of contents lease payments and other obligations 
this transaction is expected to close in phases throughout and will be recorded in our consolidated financial statements upon closing 
we are currently marketing the remaining three former kids r us store properties for disposition 
we recorded costs and charges of million in the fourth quarter of for the closing of the free standing kids r us and imaginarium stores  and we expect to record additional charges of approximately million during in  we recorded charges to close toys r us stores and kids r us stores  all of which have closed 
in conjunction with most of the kids r us store closings  we converted the nearest toys r us store into a toys r us combo store  which combines our toy offering with approximately  square feet of apparel offering 
also  as part of this plan  we eliminated approximately  staff positions in our stores and headquarters and consolidated five of our store support center facilities into our current global store support center facility in wayne  new jersey 
we have obtained a signed letter of intent to sell our former store support center facility in montvale  new jersey to a third party  and we continue to aggressively pursue a sub tenant for our former store support center facilities in paramus and fort lee  new jersey 
we recorded net charges of million in the fourth quarter of for these initiatives and have recorded additional net charges of million in and million in  primarily related to the disposition of the real estate properties discussed above

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided from operations  our existing cash balances  and our revolving credit facilities 
the seasonal nature of our business typically causes cash balances to decline from the beginning of the fiscal year through october as inventory increases for the holiday selling season and funds are used for construction of new stores  as well as remodeling and other initiatives that normally occur in this period 
our revolving credit facilities are available for seasonal borrowings and general corporate purposes

we are in compliance with all covenants associated with the above contractual obligations 
the covenants include  among other things  requirements to provide financial information and public filings and to comply with specified financial ratios 
we also are in compliance with covenants associated with our unsecured revolving credit facilities 
one covenant requires our total debt to capital ratio to be less than 
this ratio was as of january  the other covenant requires our fixed charge ratio to be greater than this ratio is calculated by dividing earnings before interest  income tax  depreciation  and rent expense  by the total of interest and rent expense  and was at january  non compliance with associated covenants could give rise to accelerated payments  requirements to provide collateral  or changes in terms contained in the respective agreements 

table of contents we currently have million in unsecured committed revolving credit facilities from a syndicate of financial institutions 
however  million of this million will expire in may we do not plan to renew this expiring facility since we do not believe that we will need this additional facility given our current liquidity position 
the credit facilities are available for seasonal borrowings and other general corporate purposes 
there were no outstanding balances under these credit facilities at the end of  or additionally  we have lines of credit with various banks to meet certain of the short term financing needs of our foreign subsidiaries

in addition to the above  we had million of outstanding letters of credit related to import merchandise at january  credit ratings on march   standard poor s revised our long term debt credit rating to bb  a one level downgrade from bb

our current credit ratings are as follows moody s standard and poor s long term debt ba bb commercial paper np nr outlook negative negative other credit ratings for our debt are available  however  we have disclosed only the ratings of the two largest nationally recognized statistical rating organizations because we believe these are the most relevant to our business 
our current credit ratings  as well as future rating agency actions  could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms  have the effect of increasing our financing costs  and have the effect of slightly increasing our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our self insured programs 
our debt instruments do not contain provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and during the 
table of contents applicable periods 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that include significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made  and if changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for the toys r us us division  other than apparel  are stated at the lower of lifo last in  first out cost or market value  as determined by the retail inventory method and represent approximately of total merchandise inventories 
all other merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of fifo first in  first out cost or market value as determined by the retail inventory method 
we receive various types of merchandise and other types of allowances from our vendors based on negotiated terms 
we use estimates at interim periods to record our provisions for inventory shortage  to adjust certain inventories to a lifo basis  and to record merchandise allowances from our vendors 
these estimates are based on the development of the cost to retail ratios estimated average markup percentages for product categories  consumer price index data  estimated inventory turnover  and the accounting for retail price adjustments 
these estimates are based on available data and are adjusted to actual amounts at the completion of our physical inventories  finalization of all vendor allowance agreements  and the closing of our books at the end of our fiscal year 
in addition  we perform an inventory aging analysis for the establishment of markdown reserves for inventory items that have been on hand for more than one year at the end of our fiscal year 
we also establish markdown reserves for items that will soon be obsolete due to anticipated developments in technology or products that are updated each year 
specific reserves are established based on the above and anticipated turnover of specific items based on planned marketing events and negotiated vendor support for reduced pricing of the identified items 
factors such as slower inventory turnover due to changes in competitors tactics  consumer preferences  consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns  among other factors  could cause excess inventory requiring greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases  resulting in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sales shortfalls due to the above factors could cause reduced purchases from vendors and associated vendor allowances that would also result in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements 
insurance risks we insure a substantial portion of our general liability and workers compensation risks through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  in addition to third party insurance coverage 
provisions for losses related to self insured risks are based upon independent actuarially determined estimates 
we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of assets we periodically review the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill  for indicators of impairment  and we test goodwill for impairment annually 
indicators of impairment for long lived assets  other 
table of contents than goodwill  include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses  and a significant decrease in the fair market value of an asset 
in addition  plans and intentions of management  such as a decision to close stores  which could impact the future cash flows associated with long lived assets could indicate impairment 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually under the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires us to estimate future cash flows to measure the recoverability of goodwill assets 
future indicators of impairment for long lived assets  other than goodwill  could result in asset impairment charges 
in addition  while we have concluded that our net goodwill of million as of january  will be fully recoverable in future periods  changes in estimated future cash flows could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the amount of income and withholding tax in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in certain jurisdictions  the rules concerning the tax treatment of various items of income  expense  and credits are ambiguous 
on a regular basis  these items  and others  are reviewed by various federal  state  and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  we routinely provide reserves for items that we believe could be challenged by these taxing authorities 
in addition  we routinely provide valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe may not be realized  eg  the tax benefits of certain foreign tax loss carryovers 
in the past year  the internal revenue service proposed  and we have agreed to  several adjustments to certain deductions claimed in our to federal income tax returns 
if and when these proposed adjustments become final  we will be able to reverse a significant amount of reserves that had been set up in prior years to cover these items and to recognize the tax benefits associated with those items that were resolved on a favorable basis 
derivatives and hedging activities we enter into derivative financial arrangements to hedge a variety of risk exposures  including interest rate and currency risks  associated with our long term debt  as well as foreign currency risk relating to import merchandise purchases 
we account for these hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and we record the fair value of these instruments within our consolidated balance sheets 
gains and losses from derivative financial instruments are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
generally  the contract terms of hedge instruments closely mirror those of the item being hedged  providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
at january   we increased the carrying amount of our long term debt by million  representing the fair value of debt in excess of the carrying amount on that date 
also at january   we recorded derivative assets of million and derivative liabilities of million 
we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting 
however  if hedges were not to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
assuming that all derivatives at january  were deemed ineffective  our consolidated financial statements would be favorably impacted by million 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to the note to consolidated financial statements entitled recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on our consolidated financial statements  beginning on page included in this discussion is the issuance of eitf  which we will adopt at the beginning of our fiscal year 
eitf will impact our consolidated financial statements in as well as the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for  when reported for comparative purposes 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from potential changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the countries in which we own assets and operate stores are politically stable 
we regularly evaluate these risks and have taken the following measures to mitigate these risks our foreign exchange risk management objectives are to stabilize cash flow from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations  we do not participate in speculative hedges  and we will  whenever practical  offset local investments in foreign currencies with liabilities denominated in the same currencies 
we also enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a variety of risk exposures including interest rate and currency risks 
our foreign currency exposure is primarily concentrated in the united kingdom  europe  canada  australia  and japan 
we face currency exposures that arise from translating the results of our worldwide operations into us dollars from exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we also face transactional currency exposures relating to merchandise that we purchase in foreign currencies 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize and manage the currency risks associated with these transactions 
the counter parties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions and we do not have significant exposure to any single counter party 
gains or losses on these derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions 
for foreign currency derivative instruments  market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed one time change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
fair values were estimated based on market prices  where available  or dealer quotes 
with respect to derivative instruments outstanding at january   a appreciation of the us dollar would have had no impact on pre tax earnings and would have increased comprehensive income in by million  while a depreciation of the us dollar would have decreased comprehensive income in by million 
comparatively  considering our derivative instruments outstanding at february   a appreciation of the us dollar would have increased comprehensive income in by million  while a depreciation of the us dollar would have decreased comprehensive income in by million 
considering our derivative instruments outstanding at february   a appreciation of the us dollar would have increased comprehensive income in by million  while a depreciation of the us dollar would have decreased comprehensive income in by million 
we are faced with interest rate risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
we have a variety of fixed and variable rate debt instruments 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and variable rate debt and have entered into interest rate swaps to maintain that balance 
for interest rate derivative instruments  market risk is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed one time change in interest rates across all maturities 
fair values were estimated based on market prices where available or dealer quotes 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts earnings  cash flow  and the fair value of debt 
a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt does not impact the fair value of debt  earnings  or cash flow 
based on our overall interest rate exposure related to floating rate debt outstanding at january   february  and february   a increase in interest rates would have an unfavorable annualized impact on pre tax earnings of million in  million in  and million in a decrease in interest rates would have a favorable annualized impact on pre tax earnings of million in  million in  and million in a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our long term debt at january  and february  by approximately million and million  respectively 
a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our long term debt at january  and february  by approximately million and million  respectively
