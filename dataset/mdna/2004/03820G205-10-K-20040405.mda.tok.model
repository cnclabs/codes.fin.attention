overview the company was founded in and develops  manufactures  and markets automated genetic imaging systems for use in cytogenetic laboratories for cancer testing  prenatal testing and other genetic testing applications 
we sell our products to government and private clinical laboratories  research institutions  universities  and pharmaceutical companies located in the united states  canada  europe  japan and other countries 
we also market imaging systems designed for use in plant and animal genetic research programs 
in addition  we have received fda clearances for a clinical system to assist in the detection of micrometastatic cancer cells in bone marrow and to analyze protein expression patterns in tumors 
this system and its research capabilities assists physicians in determining the initial staging of cancer cases  in detecting disease recurrence and in genetically characterizing cancer cells 
we are headquartered in santa clara  california  and have facilities in the united kingdom 
we are the world s leading provider of automated cytogenetic instrument systems 
our products are sold worldwide through a direct sales force  third party distributors and independent sales representatives 
we employ approximately people worldwide 
we have an installed base of over  instruments in over  laboratories and clinics in more than countries 
our cytovision  powergene and quips systems are widely utilized because of their ability to analyze human chromosome preparations using powerful software classification algorithms and a specialized user interface 
these systems also incorporate the capability to analyze and record images produced by advanced genetic research assays that employ fluorescent in situ hybridization fish or comparative genomic hybridization cgh methods 
in  we released the ariol system that is the second generation of the mds system 
the ariol system is a high throughput system designed to automate and standardize the analysis of immunohistochemistry ihc and fish test results in clinical laboratories 
the ariol system is designed to assist the pathologist and oncologist in their review of key breast cancer ihc tests 
the system is also designed to detect micrometastatic cancer cells that may be found in bone marrow and other clinical samples 
in  we also released the spot genetic analysis system  that combine with our ariol and mds systems to form the oncopath series of systems 
the spot system automatically detects and counts fluorescent labeled dna probe signals in cells 
the system is designed for a range of applications  one of which is to assist in the detection of specific genetic abnormalities that identify which patients may respond to new molecularly targeted therapies 
for example  the system is designed to automate the analysis of a fluorescent dna probe assay that may be a factor in the selection of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia to receive novartis gleevec therapy 
in  we applied for clearances from the fda for three applications for the ariol system her neu immunohistochemistry  estrogen receptor er and progesterone receptor pr 
these three applications were cleared by the fda in the first quarter of we are developing data on additional uses and applications of the 
index to financial statements ariol and spot systems that will be used to support our applications for additional clearances from the fda for promotion of these applications with specific medical or diagnostic claims 
in  we formed a scientific advisory board to provide advice and direction in scientific research and product development for our oncopath systems 
the board is comprised of academics and medical professionals representing a wide range of research and clinical interests in the field of cancer and pathology 
as a result  we believe we have assembled a distinguished international membership with a deep understanding of clinical trends  which will be instrumental in identifying new applications for our oncopath systems 
also in  we entered into several significant collaboration agreements 
one agreement is with the wellcome trust sanger institute  a leading genomics research center based in the united kingdom  to be its sole imaging development partner in the atlas of gene expression project 
we have the exclusive worldwide commercial rights to sell the various ariol applications developed under the agreement 
we also formed a clinical research imaging collaboration with the university of texas m 
d 
anderson cancer center  through which our ariol and spot systems are used by the cancer center s clinical research laboratories in ongoing research programs to more precisely characterize gene and protein expression patterns in a wide range of cancers 
additionally  we entered into a clinical research imaging collaboration with the department of anatomic pathology at the cleveland clinic foundation  through which our ariol system is being used in its pathology research programs to more precisely characterize gene and protein expression patterns in a wide range of cancers our mds system combines the ability to find targeted cancer cells using brightfield microscopy techniques  in which microscopes use white light to illuminate tissues and cells  with our decade long experience in fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis  in which narrow wavelengths of light are used to detect fluorescent tags that have been inserted into the cells or tissue sections being examined under a microscope 
taken together  these technologies allow us to analyze the proteins on or within a cell while simultaneously assessing which genes within that cell have been activated or expressed 
both protein and gene expression data are emerging as required parameters when assessing the precise nature of a given tumor or cancer cell 
gene and protein expression data are increasingly being used to select the most effective cancer therapies for individual patients 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis 
we expect that operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future and will depend on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  demand for our products  release and acceptance of new systems and new applications  timing of capital equipment orders and shipments  competition and its related pricing pressures  litigation and potential litigation  and seasonal factors  many of which are outside of our control 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues include sales of systems  software maintenance  service contract and grant revenues 
revenues decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
this reflected a revenue decrease of in north america and an increase of in the rest of the world 
the decrease in revenues in north america was due primarily to slower than projected conversion of customers using older generation systems to our newest cytovision systems 
the growth experienced in the rest of the world was due primarily to growth in our oncopath products 
for and revenues derived outside of north america were approximately and of total revenues  respectively  reflecting the sales growth in the rest of the world during and the decrease in the north american sales previously discussed 
we expect that our oncopath systems may be the primary driver of our future sales growth in north america and rest of the world markets 
sales of systems were million in  a decrease of from million in  primarily due to the sales decrease in north american markets discussed previously 

index to financial statements software maintenance  service contract and grant revenues increased by to million in from million in  primarily due to grant proceeds of  in compared to zero in grant revenues fluctuate based on the completion of programs  with revenues being recognized as the work is performed 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes direct material and labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty related expenses and post warranty service and application support expenses 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in the higher costs as a percent of revenues are due primarily to the sale of a number of our ariol systems during at a lower gross margin percent for market development purposes 
cost of system revenues increased from million in to million in or by and as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in due primarily to the sale of a number of our ariol systems during at a lower gross margin percent for market development purposes 
cost of service contract  software maintenance and grant revenues increased from million in to million in or by and as a percentage of revenues from in to in  due primarily to the unfavorable effect of translating united kingdom service and support expenses from local currency to the us dollar  and higher personnel related expenses in the us 
grant revenues did not have a significant impact on cost of revenues in either or research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses increased from million in to million in  or by due primarily to the unfavorable impact  of the weakening of the us dollar on our uk based r d expense and  in costs associated with hiring additional research staff 
r d costs were of total revenues in compared to of total revenues in r d expenses are expected to increase in line with inflation in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  or by 
the slight increase in sales and marketing expenses in was due primarily to the unfavorable impact  of the weakening of the us dollar on our us based sales and marketing expenses  and increased marketing expenses  that were offset by reduced personnel expenses in the us 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in and in  reflecting the decrease in revenues discussed earlier 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in line with revenue growth in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of

general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in line with inflation in restructuring costs 
restructuring costs amounted to  in with no such costs in in january  we instituted a series of actions to rationalize our operations to provide a lower operating cost while increasing efficiencies 
we are closing our league city  texas office and have consolidated our manufacturing and engineering facilities 
we recorded a restructuring charge of  in that was due to the costs of terminating employees  five employees in engineering  three in manufacturing  two in administration and two in sales and support and closing the league city  texas office  other income expense  net 
the increase in other income expense from an expense of  in to an income of  in was due primarily to an increase of  of foreign currency gains incurred in the translation of various balance sheet items from foreign currencies into the us from gains of  in to  in 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this reflected a revenue increase of in north america and an increase of in the rest of the world 

index to financial statements growth in sales in north america was due primarily to the unit growth in the oncopath series of products 
the slower growth experienced in the rest of the world was due to the impact of phasing out one of our genetics systems approximately million and the completion of a grant program that had generated  of revenue in and no revenue in for and revenues derived outside of north america were approximately and of total revenues  respectively  reflecting the growth in north american system sales during and the slower growth in the rest of the world markets discussed previously 
sales of systems were million in  an increase of over the million achieved in  primarily due to unit growth in north american markets discussed previously 
software maintenance  service contract and grant revenues at million in increased from the million recorded in excluding the impact of the completion of the grant program discussed previously  service contract revenues increased by to million in from million in  primarily due to growth in service contract revenues reflecting the increased emphasis placed on marketing service contracts to our customers 
grant proceeds were zero in compared to  in grant revenues fluctuate based on the completion of programs  with revenue being recognized as the work is performed 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes direct material and labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty related expenses and post warranty service and application support expenses 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in the lower costs as a percent of revenues are due to reduced manufacturing costs primarily lower material costs of components such as personal computers  monitors and flat panel displays and the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in santa clara  california that was completed in the first quarter of cost of system revenues increased from million in to million in or by and as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in due primarily to reduced manufacturing costs and the consolidation of manufacturing facilities discussed previously 
cost of service contract  software maintenance and grant revenues increased from million in to million in or by and as a percentage of revenues was in  the same level as in grant revenues did not have a significant impact on cost of revenues in either or research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in  or by due primarily to the consolidation of software support operations in january that resulted in the elimination of five personnel positions 
research and development costs were of total revenues in compared to of total revenues in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in  or by 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in and in the decrease is primarily related to reduced international sales expenses reflecting a reduced number of personnel 
included in the sales and marketing expenses for was  for the termination of an under performing sales distributor in europe 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative costs were of total revenues in compared to of total revenues in the reduction in the absolute dollar amount of spending and percentage of sales ratio is due primarily to reduced expenditures on our investor relations program  and consulting  amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill amounted to  for with no such expenses in with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in  our goodwill is no longer being amortized in the amortization expenses in represent the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the cytogenetic imaging business

the increase in other expense from  in to  in was due primarily to the increase in net interest expense from  in to  in reflecting an increase in our borrowings that were million at the end of compared to million at the end of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million compared to million at december  we maintain our cash equivalents in securities with maturities of days or less 
restricted cash  which collateralizes various credit and bank guarantees in the united kingdom  amounted to  at december  compared to  at december  the reduction in cash and cash equivalents in was due primarily to a reduction in borrowings  and purchases of property and equipment 
working capital amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  cash used in operations for the year ended december  was  compared to million for the million decrease in cash used in operations was primarily due to decreased requirements for accounts receivables of million a decrease of  in versus an increase of million in and for inventories of million a decrease of  in versus an increase of  in  reflecting decreased sales and a focus on controlling both items in these were partially offset by a million increase in the operating loss for the year  discussed above  and a million decrease in accounts payable a decrease of  in compared to an increase of  in 
the increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to sales of million in the fourth quarter that were deferred to for revenue recognition purposes pending the establishment of fair value for certain applications that were included in the sales and that were under development at the end of the quarter 

index to financial statements trade accounts receivable as a percent of fourth quarter sales were in compared to in this strong relationship between year end receivables and last quarter sales is primarily due to the fact that most of our sales occur late in the quarter as is typical of capital equipment businesses 
although our payment terms are net days  our customers  specifically government  university  japanese  chinese and european customers tend to take longer to pay their receivable balances 
we do not experience significant collection issues with our accounts  but many of our customers take longer than the stated day payment period 
at december   approximately of the receivables were outstanding for greater than days and at december   approximately were older than days 
cash used in investing activities was  in compared to  in this change was primarily due to a decrease in our short term investments of  in versus no proceeds from sales or maturities in this was partially offset by a decrease in the amount we invested for purchases of capital equipment to  in compared to  in cash used in financing activities was  in compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in we received  from the issuance of common stock in from the exercise of employee stock options compared to million in primarily from a private placement of our common stock in january  bank debt decreased by  in  in line with reduced us accounts receivables  compared to an increase of  in to fund our working capital requirements

this was reduced to  at the end of as we entered into new loan agreements in on january   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to an institutional investor purchasing for three separate funds at a purchase price of per share 
additional shares may be issuable to the investors under provisions contained in the stock purchase agreement between the investors and us  which we filed with the securities exchange commission on form s on october   as amended 
on july   each investor received a warrant exercisable for the number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock purchased by that investor in the january  financing 
a total of  warrants were issued 
the warrants are exercisable for four years from july  at a price of per share 
all of the warrants remain outstanding as of december  we established a loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb on september  this new facility replaced a three year term loan and a revolving line of credit that had an outstanding balance of million on 
index to financial statements september  the new loan agreement provided the capability to borrow up to million based on the level of certain of our north american accounts receivable and inventories 
on august  and on october   the loan agreement was amended to extend the term of the loan for an additional year  through september   to increase borrowing capability to million based on the level of certain of our north american accounts receivable and to increase the requirement for us to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth 
on september   the loan agreement was amended to extend the term of the loan for an additional year  through september   and to establish the minimum level of net tangible worth that we had to maintain through the end of the loan agreement 
we were not in compliance with the covenant requiring us to maintain million in minimum tangible net worth at december  and we have subsequently obtained a waiver for this covenant violation and any potential non compliance with the minimum net tangible worth covenant in january and february  on march   the loan agreement was amended to extend the term of the loan through march  and to establish the minimum level of net tangible worth that we had to maintain through the end of the loan agreement 
at december  we had used  of the facility with  available but not used 
the interest rate on the facility was at december   computed as the svb prime rate plus percent 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the us corporation and requires maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth 
other loan covenants include the need to maintain insurance on our property  monthly reporting to svb  the need to obtain svb approval for any extraordinary action and a limitation on the us corporation s ability to transfer more than  to a subsidiary 
in the uk  the company collateralizes various credit card and bank guarantees used for customs clearance purposes with cash deposits at an international bank amounting to   at december  
index to financial statements future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands bank loans operating leases and thereafter total we expect capital expenditures in to be consistent with historical patterns 
any capital expenditures for the new building in san jose  california will be funded by an allowance from the landlord 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for arrangements that contain software elements that are more than incidental to the products or services as a whole  we follow statement of position  sop software revenue recognition  as amended 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on vendor specific evidence  which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
in instances when evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
for most arrangements where software is more than incidental  we include bundle the first year of maintenance and support free of charge 
revenue attributable to software maintenance and support is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  generally one year 
we sell separately priced maintenance and support contracts to provide service coverage on its systems when the initial warranty period expires 
the related revenue on the maintenance and support contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contract 
costs associated with services performed under the service contract obligation are expensed as incurred 
for arrangements where no software is involved we recognize revenue upon shipment  provided that  at the time of shipment  there is evidence of contractual arrangement with the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there are no significant remaining obligations 
when we sell products to distributors  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment  net of any discount  provided that there is evidence of contractual arrangement with the distributor  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there are no significant remaining obligations 
the distributor agreements do not provide a right of return 
grant revenues are recognized as the work is performed 

index to financial statements we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we have not recorded an income tax benefit in  and due to the recording of a valuation allowance as an offset to net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets due to our history of operating losses 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or in the case of goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets and goodwill whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable or at least on an annual basis for goodwill 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
applied to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf issue no had no material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the fasb published the revision to clarify and amend some of the original provisions of fin  which was issued in january  and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
a variable interest entity vie refers to an entity subject to consolidation according to the provisions of this interpretation 
fin r applies to entities whose equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including equity holders  or where the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest 
fin r provides that if an entity is the primary beneficiary of a vie  the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of the vie should be consolidated in the entity s financial statements 
in addition  fin r requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie provide additional disclosures 
the provisions of fin r are effective for the company s fiscal first quarter 
we do not expect the adoption of fin r to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivatives and financial instruments foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenues and operating expenses in the uk denominated in the respective local currency 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in the u 
k 
denominated in the respective local currency 
instead  we believe that a natural partial hedge exits  because local currency revenues will substantially offset the operating expenses denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
we did not engage in hedging activities in and and  as of december   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as a part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
fixed income investments our exposure to market risks due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporate debt securities 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents and not subject to interest rate risks 
investments with maturities over three months and less than one year are considered to be short term investments 
at december  we did not have any short term investments 
interest rates our exposure to market risks due to changes in interest rates also relates to interest expense on our loan outstanding with silicon valley bank svb 
the loan provides us with borrowing capability of up to million based on the level of certain of our north american accounts receivable 
at december  we had used  of the facility with  available but not used 
the interest rate on the facility was at december   computed as the svb prime rate plus percent 
a plus or minus change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations
