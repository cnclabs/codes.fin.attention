item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and related notes thereto 
we consist of digital angel corporation and its three subsidiaries digital angel technology corporation datc  timely technology corp 
and signature industries  limited 
these three subsidiaries were known as the advanced wireless group awg 
datc is engaged in the business of developing and bringing to market proprietary technologies used to identify  locate and monitor people  animals and objects 
datc is the result of the merger in september of destron fearing corporation and digital angel 
net inc  which was then a wholly owned subsidiary of ads 
upon the acquisition of medical advisory systems  inc in march  the company re organized into four segments animal applications  wireless and monitoring  gps and radio communications and medical systems 
prior period segment information has been restated to reflect our current segment structure 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to inventory obsolescence  goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
there was no impairment of goodwill upon the adoption of sfas on january  however based upon an annual review for impairment  we recorded impairment charges of million and million in the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
the impairment charge in related to the goodwill associated with the medical systems reporting unit 
the impairment charge in related to the goodwill at the wireless and monitoring and medical systems reporting units 
further  the company recorded an additional impairment charge of million to write down certain intangible assets to their estimated fair value 
in accordance with fas  upon adoption  we were required to allocate goodwill to the various reporting units 
upon the acquisition of medical advisory systems  inc in march  the reporting units consisted of the following the reporting units listed below are those businesses  which have goodwill and for which discrete financial information is available and upon which segment management makes operating decisions animal applications wireless and monitoring gps and radio communications medical systems our reporting units at december   were the same as its reporting units at december  we engaged an independent valuation firm to review and evaluate the goodwill as reflected on our books as of december  and independently  the valuation firm reviewed the goodwill of the various reporting units animal applications  wireless and monitoring  gps and radio communications and medical systems 
the company s management compiled the cash flow forecasts  growth rates  gross margin  fixed and variable cost structure  depreciation and amortization expenses  corporate overhead  tax rates  and capital expenditures  among other data and assumptions related to the financial projections upon which the valuation reports were based 
the valuation firm s methodology including residual or terminal enterprise values were based on the following factors risk free rate of years  current leverage e v  leveraged beta bloomberg  unleveraged beta  risk premium  cost of equity  after tax cost of debt  and weighted average cost of capital 
these variables generated a discount rate calculation 
the assumptions used in the determination of fair value using discounted cash flows were as follows cash flows were generated for years based on the expected recovery period for the goodwill  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization were used as the measure of cash flow  and discount rates ranging from to 
the rate was determined based on the risk free rate of the year us treasury bond plus a market risk premium of 
the discount rate utilized by the company was the rate of return expected from the market or the rate of return for a similar investment with similar risks 
the independent valuation firm performed a company comparable analysis utilizing financial and market information on publicly traded companies that are considered to be generally comparable to the animal applications  wireless and monitoring  gps and radio communications and medical systems reporting units 
each analysis provided a benchmark for determining the terminal values for each business unit to be utilized in its discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis generated a multiple for each reporting unit  which was incorporated into the appropriate business unit s discounted cash flow model 
the analyses for indicated that the remaining goodwill associated with the medical systems reporting unit of approximately million was impaired 
the analyses for indicated that approximately million of the goodwill associated with the medical systems division and all of the goodwill associated with its wireless and monitoring division of approximately million was impaired 
future goodwill impairment reviews may result in additional write downs 
such determination involves the use of estimates and assumptions  which may be difficult to accurately measure or value 
we will assess the fair value of our goodwill annually or earlier if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our goodwill below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in business climate  including a significant  sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
if we determine that significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to write off the impaired portion of goodwill 
impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  management estimated that certain intangible assets at our medical systems reporting unit were impaired by million 
the gps and radio communications segment recorded a million impairment charge in property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that an exclusive perpetual license to a digital encryption and distribution software system that was purchased by ads in april and contributed to awg in was impaired 
accordingly  we wrote off the net book value of the asset  which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
there were no write downs of any long lived assets in or inventories estimates are used in determining the likelihood that inventory on hand can be sold 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both obsolescence and slow moving inventory 
inventory is stated at lower of cost or market  determined by the first in  first out method  net of any reserve for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
revenue recognition for product sales  the company recognizes revenue at the time product is shipped and title has transferred  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is deemed probable 
if uncertainties regarding customer acceptance exists  revenue is recognized when such uncertainties are resolved 
there are no significant post contract support obligations at the time of revenue recognition 
digital angel corporation s accounting policy regarding vendor and post contract support obligations is based on the terms of the customers contracts  billable upon occurrence of the post sale support 
costs of products sold and services provided are recorded as the related revenue is recognized 
digital angel corporation offers a warranty on its products 
for non fixed fee jobs  revenue is recognized based on the actual direct labor hours in the job multiplied by the standard billing rate and adjusted to net realizable value  if necessary 
revenues from contracts that provide services are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
fixed fee revenues from contracts for services are recorded when earned and exclude reimbursable costs 
reimbursable costs incurred in performing such services are presented on a net basis and include transportation  medical and communication costs 
other revenue is recognized at the time service or goods are provided 
it is the company s policy to record contract losses in their entirety in the period in which such losses are foreseeable 
results of operations the following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of net operating revenues and is derived from the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations included in this report 
for the years ended december  product revenue service revenue total net revenue cost of products sold cost of services sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense management fees applied digital solutions  inc research and development expense asset impairment interest expense applied digital solutions  inc interest expense others other income loss before taxes  minority interest share of losses and equity in net loss of affiliate provision for income taxes loss before minority interest share of losses and equity in net loss of affiliate minority interest share of losses equity in net loss of affiliate net loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue from operations for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the year ended december  revenue for the years ended december  and for each of the operating segments was as follows in thousands animal applications wireless and monitoring gps and radio communications medical systems total the animal applications segment s revenue increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in revenue results from increased engineering service revenue of approximately million in  an increase in microchip sales to companion animal and fish and wildlife customers of approximately million and increased sales of visual identification products 
the engineering service revenue results from research and development performed for certain of our fish and wildlife customers 
several bills proposing the establishment of a national electronic identification program for livestock have recently been introduced in congress 
we cannot estimate the impact a national identification program would have on the animal application segment s revenue 
however  if implemented  we would expect the impact to be favorable 
the wireless and monitoring segment s revenue decreased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the cancellation of a significant software support contract  assumed from timely technology  in february the digital angel tm technology continues to be in the development stage and we are uncertain when this technology will be incorporated into any product 
therefore we do not expect any revenues in the gps and radio communications segment s revenue increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase results from increases in the exchange rate 
sales in the local currency for the year ended december  decreased slightly due to decreased locator beacon sales 
we expect revenue in to increase due to the introduction of a new pilot locator beacon in the second quarter of the medical systems segment s revenue increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in revenue results from the inclusion of twelve months of revenue in compared to nine months in  offset by the cancellation of a significant customer in january the medical systems segment was acquired in the mas acquisition in march we do not expect any increase in the medical system segment s revenue in on january  we acquired outerlink corporation 
we expect increased revenue in as a result of the inclusion of outerlink s revenues in our financial results 
gross profit and gross profit margin gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  the gross profit margin was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit for the years ended december  and for each operating segment was as follows in thousands animal applications wireless and monitoring gps and radio communications medical systems total gross profit margin for the years ended december  and for each operating segment was as follows animal applications wireless and monitoring gps and radio communications medical systems total the animal applications segment s gross profit of million in the year ended december  increased million compared to million in the year ended december  we attribute million of the increase to the increase in sales and million of the increase to increased gross profit margin resulting from increased engineering service revenue 
the gross profit margin increased to in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  due to decreased material costs and an increase in higher margin service revenue in the wireless and monitoring segment s gross profit decreased in when compared to gross profit margin however  increased to in from in due to the completion of the alpha phase of a project for which all costs are included in research and development expense 
the gps and radio communication segment s gross profit remains unchanged in when compared to gross profit margin decreased to in from in due to a slight shift in product mix to lower margin products in compared to the medical systems segment s gross profit increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase relates to the inclusion of twelve months of gross profit in compared to nine months in  offset by lower margins in gross margin percentage decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  margins decreased in due to a higher percentage of product revenue  which have lower margins than service revenue 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease in expense was the result of an million charge in arising from the remeasurement of options in connection with the merger in which did not recur in pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  options to acquire shares of datc common stock were converted into options to acquire shares of medical advisory systems common stock effective march  the conversion resulted in a new measurement date for the options and  as a result  the company recorded a charge of approximately million in non cash compensation expense during the three months ended march  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the million charge in  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and for each of the operating segments  excluding the million charge in  was as follows in thousands animal applications wireless and monitoring gps and radio communications medical systems total selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue for each of the operating segments for the years ended december  and for each of the operating segments excluding the million charge in was as follows animal applications wireless and monitoring gps and radio communications medical systems total the animal applications segment s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and as a percentage of revenue decreased to from in the same respective period 
we attribute the increase in expense to additional consulting expenses of million associated with the verichip distribution and licensing agreement 
the wireless and monitoring segment s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the exclusion of amortization expense for a license to a digital encryption and distribution software system that the company wrote off in the fourth quarter of included in the wireless and monitoring segment s selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is million of amortization expense for this asset 
in addition  the decrease results from the significant scale back in development of the digital angel tm technology  including a reduction in personnel  resulting in a decrease in selling  general and administrative expense 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will continue to decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  as a result of the significant decline in revenue in the gps and radio communications segment s selling  general and administrative expense increased million in the year ended december  to million as compared to million in the year ended december  due primarily to increased marketing costs 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the medical systems segment s selling  general and administrative expense increased million in the year ended december  to million from million in the year ended december  we attribute million of the increase to the inclusion of twelve months of operations in compared to nine months in  offset by decreased administrative expenses in this segment became part of the company on march  management fees applied digital solutions  inc management fees charged by ads amounted to million for the year ended december  these fees were for general and administrative services performed for us by ads 
the management fee arrangement with ads terminated on march  research and development expense research and development expense was million in the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expense for the years ended december  and for each of the operating segments was as follows in thousands animal applications wireless and monitoring gps and radio communications medical systems total the increase in expense is due to research and development expenses at our gps and radio communications segment for its recent search and rescue beacon project and research and development expenses incurred for the animal application segment s temperature sensing implantable microchip and engineering expenses to support improved transponder performance 
the increase is offset by a decrease in research and development expense at our wireless and monitoring due to a scale back in the development of the digital angel tm technology

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations and sales in various regions of the world 
additionally  we export to and import from other countries 
our operations may  therefore  be subject to volatility because of currency fluctuations  inflation and changes in political and economic conditions in these countries 
sales and expenses may be denominated in local currencies and may be affected as currency fluctuations affect our product prices and operating costs or those of our competitors 
we presently do not use any derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  fluctuations in commodity prices or other market risks  nor do we invest in speculative financial instruments 
due to the nature of our borrowings and our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure and  therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
