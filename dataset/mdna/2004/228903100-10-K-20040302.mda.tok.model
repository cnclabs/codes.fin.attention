fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda notices and correspondence for a discussion of events surrounding fda compliance activities in and critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
deferred preservation costs tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ and tissue procurement agencies  which consign the tissue to the company for processing and preservation 
preservation costs related to tissue held by the company are deferred until revenue is recognized upon shipment of the tissue to the implanting facilities 
deferred preservation costs consist primarily of direct labor and materials including laboratory expenses  tissue procurement fees  freight in charges and fringe benefits  and indirect costs including allocations of costs from departments that support processing activities and facility allocations 
deferred preservation costs are stated  net of reserve  on a first in  first out basis 
the calculation of deferred preservation costs includes a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the costs included in deferred preservation costs contain several estimates due to the timing differences between the occurrence of the cost and receipt of final bills for services 
costs that contain estimates include tissue procurement fees  which are estimated based on the company s contracts with independent procurement agencies  and freight in charges  which are estimated based on the company s prior experiences with these charges 
management believes that its estimates approximate the actual costs of these services  but estimates could differ from actual costs 
total deferred preservation costs are then allocated among the different tissues processed during the period based on specific cost drivers such as the number of donors and the number of tissues processed 
at each balance sheet date a portion of the deferred preservation costs relates to tissues currently in active processing or held in quarantine pending release to implantable status 
the company applies a yield to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable 
management determines this estimate of quarantine yields based on its experience in prior periods and reevaluates this estimate periodically 
due to the nature of this estimate and the length of the processing times experienced by the company  actual yields could differ from the company s estimates 
a significant change in quarantine yields could materially affect the deferred preservation costs per tissue  which could impact the value of deferred preservation costs on the company s balance sheet and the cost of preservation services  including the lower of cost or market write down  on the company s statement of operations 
during the company recorded a write down of deferred preservation costs of million for valved cardiac tissues  million for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues  and million for orthopaedic tissue  totaling million 
these write downs were recorded as a result of the fda order as discussed in item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation 
the amount of these write downs reflected management s estimates based on information available to it at the time the estimates were made and actual results did differ from these estimates 
the write down created a new cost basis  which cannot be written back up if these tissues become available for distribution 
the cost of human tissue preservation services has been favorably affected by tissue shipments that were related to previously written down deferred preservation costs 
the cost of human tissue preservation services may continue to be favorably affected depending on the future level of tissue shipments related to previously written down deferred preservation costs  but such impact is not expected to be material 
management continues to evaluate the recoverability of the deferred preservation costs and will record additional write downs if it becomes clear that additional impairments have occurred 
the company regularly evaluates its deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
during the company recorded million as an increase to cost of preservation services to write down the value of certain deferred tissue preservation costs from tissues that exceeded market value 
the amount of these write downs reflects management s estimates of market value based on recent average service fees 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
as of december  deferred preservation costs were million for allograft heart valve tissues   for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues  and million for orthopaedic tissues 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes 
the company generated deferred tax assets in and primarily as a result of write downs of deferred preservation costs  accruals for product liability claims  and operating losses  reflecting reductions in revenues and additional professional fees  as a result of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and reported tissue infections 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance when management believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company evaluated several factors to determine if a valuation allowance relative to its deferred tax assets was necessary during the company reviewed its historic operating results  including the reasons for its operating losses in and  uncertainties regarding projected future operating results due to the effects of the adverse publicity resulting from the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and reported tissue infections and the changes in processing methods resulting from the fda order  and the uncertainty of the outcome of product liability claims 
based on the results of this analysis  the company determined that it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will not be realized 
therefore  during the company recorded valuation allowances totaling million due to the effect of temporary differences between book and tax income  the net deferred tax assets generated in  and the net deferred tax asset balance at december  as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and a net deferred tax asset balance of zero 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of its long lived  identifiable intangible assets and related goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and o significant decline in the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires the write down of a long lived asset to be held and used if the carrying value of the asset or the asset group to which the asset belongs is not recoverable 
the carrying value of the asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
in applying sfas  the company defined the specific asset groups used to perform the cash flow analysis 
the company defined the asset groups at the lowest level possible  by identifying the cash flows from groups of assets that could be segregated from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
using this methodology  the company determined that its asset groups consisted of the long lived assets related to the company s two reporting segments 
as the company does not segregate assets by segment  the company allocated assets to the two reporting segments based on factors including facility space and revenues 
the company used a fourteen year period for the undiscounted future cash flows 
this period of time was selected based upon the remaining life of the primary assets of the asset groups  which are leasehold improvements 
the undiscounted future cash flows related to these asset groups exceeded their carrying values as of december  and  therefore  management has concluded that there is not an impairment of the company s long lived intangible assets and tangible assets related to the tissue preservation business or medical device business 
however  depending on the company s ability to rebuild demand for its tissue preservation services and the future effects of events surrounding the fda order  these assets may become impaired 
management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of these assets in accordance with sfas beginning with the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  the goodwill resulting from business acquisitions is not amortized  but is instead subject to periodic impairment testing in accordance with sfas patent costs are amortized over the expected useful lives of the patents primarily years using the straight line method 
other intangibles  which consist primarily of manufacturing rights and agreements  are amortized over the expected useful lives of the related assets primarily five years 
as a result of the fda order  the company determined that an evaluation of the possible impairment of non amortizing intangible assets under sfas was necessary 
the company engaged an independent valuation expert to perform the valuation using a discounted cash flow methodology  and as a result of this analysis  the company determined that goodwill related to its tissue processing reporting unit was fully impaired as of september  therefore  the company recorded a write down of million in goodwill during the quarter ended september  as of december  the company does not believe an additional impairment exists related to its other non amortizing intangible assets 
management does not believe an impairment exists related to the other intangible assets that were assessed in accordance with sfas no 
product liability claims in the normal course of business as a medical device and services company  the company has product liability complaints filed against it 
following the fda order  a greater number of lawsuits than has historically been the case have been filed 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to unreported product liability claims  and records accruals as necessary for the estimated cost of unreported claims related to services performed and products sold 
during the company retained an independent actuarial firm to perform revised estimates of the unreported claims  the latest of which was performed as of december  the independent firm estimated the unreported product loss liability using a frequency severity approach  whereby  projected losses were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims were calculated based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim was calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
as a result of the actuarial valuation  the company accrued an additional million during for estimated costs for unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  the million expense was recorded in general  administrative  and marketing expenses 
as of december  the company had accrued a total of million in estimated costs for unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  this accrual reflected management s estimate based on information available to it at the time the estimate was made 
actual results may differ from this estimate 
the million balance is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
for the and insurance policy years  the company maintained claims made insurance policies  which the company believes to be adequate to defend against the suits filed during this period 
as of december  the company has an accrual of  for retention levels related to the and policy years 
for the insurance policy year  the company maintained claims made insurance policies with three carriers 
the company used all of its insurance coverage  aggregating million  for the insurance policy year  as well as funds of its own  to resolve claims outstanding in the relevant policy period 
the company will be required to fund any amounts needed to defend against the remaining suits filed during the insurance policy year 
for the insurance policy year  the company maintains a first year claims made insurance policy  ie only claims incurred and reported during the policy period april  through march  are covered by this policy 
of the three lawsuits filed in the insurance policy year  one is covered by insurance and two are uncovered 
the company believes its insurance policy to be adequate to defend against the one suit filed to date during this insurance policy year 
other product liability claims have been asserted against the company that have not resulted in lawsuits 
the company is monitoring these claims 
the company performed an analysis as of december  of the pending product liability claims based on settlement negotiations to date and advice from counsel 
as of december  the company had remaining in an accrual a total of million for the uninsured product liability claims 
the million balance is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the amounts recorded are reflective of potential legal fees and settlement costs related to these claims  and do not reflect actual settlement arrangements  actual judgments  including punitive damages  which may be assessed by the courts  or cash set aside for the purpose of making payments 
the company s product liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages  which may be assessed at trial 
additionally  if the company is unable to settle the outstanding claims for amounts within its ability to pay or one or more of the product liability claims in which the company is a defendant should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  there can be no assurance that such verdict s would not exceed the company s available insurance coverage and liquid assets 
if the company is unable to meet required future cash payments to resolve the outstanding product liability claims  it will have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
new accounting pronouncements the company was required to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas on january  sfas addresses accounting and reporting for retirement costs of long lived assets resulting from legal obligations associated with acquisition  construction  or development transactions 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows of the company 
the company was required to adopt sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements  and  amendment to fasb statement  and technical corrections sfas  on january  sfas rescinds sfas nos 
 and  which required gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be classified as extraordinary items 
sfas also amends sfas no 
 eliminating inconsistencies in certain sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows of the company 
the company was required to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas on january  sfas requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recorded at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows of the company 
the company was required to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas on december  sfas amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirement of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the adoption of the additional disclosure requirements of sfas did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows of the company 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas requires that certain instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  because the company does not have any of the effected financial instruments  the company believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on its financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported     estimated tissue recall returns  adjustment to estimated tissue recall returns adjusted revenues     revenues as reported increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to continued growth in sales of bioglue surgical adhesive  partially offset by a decrease in tissue service revenues 
revenues as reported decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  include  in favorable adjustments to the estimated tissue recall returns due to lower actual tissue returns under the fda order than were originally estimated 
revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  were adversely affected by the estimated effect of the return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of million in preservation service revenues 
as of december  there is no remaining accrual for estimated return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order 
adjusted revenues decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this decrease in adjusted revenues for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in cryopreservation services revenues for cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues when compared to the prior year period  partially offset by an increase in sales of bioglue surgical adhesive 
further discussion of the decrease in cryopreservation service revenues for each of the three major tissue types processed by the company and the increase in bioglue revenues continues in the detailed sections below 
the measurement adjusted revenues is defined as revenues prior to estimated tissue recall returns and adjustments made to estimated tissue recall returns 
this measurement may be deemed to be a non gaap financial measure as that term is defined in regulation g and item e of regulation s k and is included for informational purposes to provide comparable disclosure in the current and prior periods of revenues derived from services provided with respect to tissues and products shipped in the normal course of business 
the gaap number revenue as reported in the prior year periods was calculated by deducting the amount of estimated tissue recall returns for subsequent returns of fda recalled tissues from revenue related to tissues and products shipped in the normal course of business 
in order to compute revenues as adjusted this unfavorable item from the prior periods was added back to show a clearer comparison to current year periods and to illustrate the magnitude of the decrease in current year revenues 
the adjustment to estimated tissue recall returns was recorded during the current year periods to reduce the original estimate of the effect of returns of fda recalled tissues based on revised estimates 
in order to compute revenues as adjusted this item from the current year periods was added back for the reasons discussed above with respect to estimated tissue returns 
the presentation of revenue as reported without the presentation of adjusted revenues might mislead investors with respect to the magnitude of the decrease in the company s current year revenues relative to the prior year 
bioglue surgical adhesive three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported     bioglue revenues as reported as a percentage of total revenue as reported bioglue revenues as reported as a percentage of total adjusted revenues a revenues as reported from the sale of bioglue surgical adhesive increased and  respectively  for the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december  the increase in revenues as reported for the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in bioglue sales volume due to an increase in demand in both foreign and domestic markets which increased revenues by  and an increase in average selling prices which increased revenues by 
the increase in revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  was due to an increase in bioglue sales volume due to an increase in demand in both foreign and domestic markets which increased revenues by  and by an increase in average selling prices which increased revenues by 
volume increases in both the three and twelve months ended december  were led by large percentage increases in the bioglue ml and ml product sizes 
the bioglue ml size continued to generate the largest amount of bioglue revenue  accounting for and  respectively  of total bioglue revenues during the three and twelve months ended december  domestic revenues accounted for of total bioglue revenues for both the three and twelve months ended december   and and  respectively  of total bioglue revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  domestic and international revenue growth continues to be strong  however  foreign revenues in benefited from the stronger british pound  which yielded higher sales in us dollars due to the favorable effects of currency translation 
foreign bioglue revenues increased in over of which was due to favorable foreign exchange rates in the company anticipates that revenues from bioglue surgical adhesive will continue to grow in on december  the company initiated price changes for bioglue  which increased the list price of bioglue surgical adhesive  delivery devices  and applicator tips 
the company anticipates that this price increase will generate additional revenues in  in addition to continued growth in bioglue sales volume 
cardiovascular preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported     estimated tissue recall returns adjustment to estimated tissue recall returns adjusted revenues a     cardiovascular revenues as reported as a percentage of total revenue as reported cardiovascular adjusted revenues as a percentage of total adjusted revenues a revenues as reported from cardiovascular preservation services decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the decrease in revenues for the three months ended december  was due to a decrease in average service fees  which reduced revenues by  and a slight decrease in cardiovascular volume  which reduced revenues by 
the decrease in average service fees was largely driven by a change in product mix as shipments of heart valves decreased  while shipments of lower fee cardiac tissues such as non valved conduits and patch material increased 
the decrease in heart valve shipments is directly related to the reduced amount of tissues available for implantation due to a reduction in procurement levels during  the disposal of much of the company s heart valve tissue processed prior to october  and increased tissue processing times and lower yields of implantable tissue per donor as a result of process changes implemented in the latter half of and during in addition average service fees were negatively impacted by the company s suspension of shipments of synergraft processed cardiac tissues  which usually demand higher average service fees for heart valves and for non valved cardiac tissues 
revenues as reported from cardiovascular preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  cardiovascular revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  include  in favorable adjustments to the estimated tissue recall returns due to lower actual tissue returns under the fda order than were estimated in the prior year 
cardiovascular revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  were adversely affected by the estimated effect of the non valved cardiac tissues returned subject to the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of  in service revenues 
adjusted revenues from cardiovascular preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the decrease in adjusted revenues for the twelve months ended december  was due to a decrease in cardiovascular volume primarily due to the decrease in cardiac shipments in as a result of the effects of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events as discussed in item business

fda order on human tissue preservation  the company s procurement of cardiac tissues during the twelve months ended december   from which heart valves and non valved cardiac tissues are processed  decreased as compared to twelve months ended december  the company s procurement of cardiac tissues remained relatively steady during the second  third  and fourth quarters of from its low in the first quarter of however  these recent procurement levels remain approximately below procurement levels prior to the fda order in the second quarter of the company anticipates that cardiovascular service revenues will decrease in as compared to  if the company continues to process and ship tissues using only its traditional cryopreservation process 
increases in cardiovascular revenues in the long term are contingent on the company s ability to increase the amount of tissues available for implantation by decreasing tissue processing times and increasing yields of implantable tissue per donor and to resume processing and shipping tissues processed using synergraft technology 
as discussed in item business 
the company has voluntarily suspended the use of the synergraft technology in the processing of allograft cardiovascular tissue and in late september suspended the distribution of tissues on hand that were preserved with the synergraft technology until the regulatory status of the cryovalve sg is resolved 
on november  the company filed a k premarket notification with the fda for the cryovalve sg 
on february  the company received a letter from the fda requesting additional information be provided to support the k premarket notification for the cryovalve sg 
the requested information may require additional studies be undertaken 
clearance of the k premarket notification with the fda will be required before the company can resume processing and distribution of synergraft processed cardiovascular tissue 
the outcome of the k premarket notification application with the fda regarding the use of the synergraft process on human tissue could result in the elimination of synergraft processed cardiovascular tissue 
vascular preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported     extimated tissue recall returns  adjustment to estimated tissue recall returns adjusted revenues a     vascular revenues as reported as a percentage of total revenue as reported vascular adjusted revenues as a percentage of total adjusted revenues a revenues as reported from vascular preservation services decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the decrease in revenues for the three months ended december  was due to a decrease in volume  which reduced revenues by  partially offset by a slight increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the decrease in volume was largely driven by fewer shipments of saphenous veins  which represented and  respectively  of vascular preservation service revenues for the three months ended december  and the decrease in saphenous vein shipments is directly related to the reduced amount of tissues available for implantation due to a reduction in procurement levels during  the disposal of much of the company s tissues processed prior to october  in accordance with the fda order  and increased tissue processing times and lower yields of implantable tissue per donor as a result of process changes implemented in the latter half of and during the increase in average service fees was primarily due to a lower percentage of discounted multi tissue heart and limb packs being shipped in compared to heart and limb packs generally have reduced fees when compared to similar amounts of tissues shipped individually 
revenues as reported from vascular preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  vascular revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  include  in favorable adjustments to the estimated tissue recall returns due to lower actual tissue returns under the fda order than were estimated in the prior year 
vascular revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  were adversely affected by the estimated effect of the vascular tissues returned subject to the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of million in service revenues 
adjusted revenues from vascular preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the decrease in adjusted revenues for the twelve months ended december  was due to a decrease in vascular volume primarily due to the decrease in vascular shipments in as a result of the effects of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events as discussed in item business

increases in vascular revenues in the long term are contingent on the company s ability to increase the amount of tissues available for implantation by decreasing tissue processing times and increasing yields of implantable tissue per donor and to increase the level of procurement as necessary based on customer demand and processing capacity 
as discussed in item business 
other fda correspondence the company has voluntarily suspended the use of the synergraft technology in the processing of vascular tissue and in late september suspended the distribution of tissues on hand that have been preserved with the synergraft technology until the regulatory status of the cryovein sg is resolved 
additionally  the company has discontinued labeling its vascular grafts for use as a v access grafts 
on december  the company received a letter from the fda stating that it was the agency s position that vascular tissues processed with the synergraft technology should be regulated as medical devices 
the outcome of the discussions and filing with the fda regarding the use of the synergraft process on human tissue could result in an inability to process and distribute tissues with the synergraft technology until further submissions and fda clearances are granted 
orthopaedic preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported   estimated tissue recall returns adjustment to estimated tissue recall returns adjusted revenues a   orthopaedic revenues as reported as a percentage of total revenue as reported orthopaedic adjusted revenues as a percentage of total adjusted revenues a revenues as reported from orthopaedic preservation services increased to  for the three months ended december  as compared to  for the three months ended december  revenues in both periods were minimal due to a severe reduction in processing and shipments of orthopaedic tissues following the fda order and subsequent fda activity as discussed in item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation 
processing and shipping of orthopaedic tissues throughout has remained at levels significantly below the levels experienced prior to the fda order 
revenues as reported from orthopaedic preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  orthopaedic revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  include  in favorable adjustments to the estimated tissue recall returns due to lower actual tissue returns under the fda order than were estimated in the prior year 
orthopaedic revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  were adversely affected by the estimated effect of the orthopaedic tissues returned subject to the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of  in service revenues 
adjusted revenues from orthopaedic preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the decrease in adjusted revenues for the twelve months ended december  was due to a decrease in orthopaedic volume primarily due to the decrease in orthopaedic shipments in as a result of the effects of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events as discussed in item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation  which reduced revenues by  and a decrease in average service fees which decreased revenues by 
during the company temporarily suspended its processing of orthopaedic tissues as a result of the fda order 
the company resumed limited processing of orthopaedic tissues in late february and began shipments of these orthopaedic tissues processed since february with the shipment of non boned orthopaedic tissues in may and boned orthopaedic tissues in august during september the company halted the shipment of boned orthopaedic tissues in order to conduct an additional review of the systems in place to process and release boned orthopaedic tissues 
in december the company resumed shipment of boned orthopaedic tissues after the completion of its review 
these suspensions of processing  combined with the disposal of much of the company s orthopaedic tissue processed prior to october  in accordance with the fda order  resulted in low levels of orthopaedic tissues available for shipment in the latter half of and much of as a result of effects of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events as discussed in item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation  the company s procurement of orthopaedic tissues during the twelve months ended december  decreased as compared to twelve months ended december  the company s procurement of orthopaedic tissues has increased quarter over quarter throughout  after recovering somewhat from its low in the fourth quarter of procurement of orthopaedic tissues in the fourth quarter of increased over procurement levels in the third quarter of however  procurement levels in the fourth quarter of are still approximately below procurement levels prior to the fda order in the second quarter of the company anticipates that orthopaedic service revenues will show a significant increase in as compared to based on expected procurement levels  consumer demand  and an improvement in yields of implantable tissues 
revenues from orthopaedic tissue services are still expected to be well below levels prior to the fda order 
increases in orthopaedic revenues in the long term are contingent on the company s ability to increase the amount of tissues available for implantation by decreasing tissue processing times and increasing yields of implantable tissue per donor and to increase the level of procurement as necessary based on processing capacity and customer demand 
distribution and grant revenues grant revenues increased to  in from  in grant revenues in and were attributable to the activation control technology act research and development programs through aurazyme pharmaceuticals  inc aurazyme and the synergraft research and development programs 
in february the company formed the wholly owned subsidiary aurazyme to foster the commercial development of act  a reversible linker technology that has potential uses in the areas of cancer therapy  fibrinolysis blood clot dissolving  and other drug delivery applications 
distribution revenues decreased to zero in from  in distribution revenues consisted of commissions received for the distribution of orthopaedic tissues for another processor 
the company does not currently anticipate receiving distribution revenues from any third party processors in cost of human tissue preservation services cost of human tissue preservation services decreased to million in as compared to million in cost of human tissue preservation services for includes an increase to cost of preservation services of million to adjust the value of certain deferred tissue preservation costs that exceeded market value  and the favorable effect on gross margin of approximately million related to shipments of tissue with a zero cost basis due to the prior write downs of these deferred preservation costs in the second and third quarter of the cost of human tissue preservation services for includes million in write downs of deferred preservation costs for tissues subject to the fda order 
the remaining decrease in costs is largely due to the reduced amount of tissue preservation services and related costs in the first seven months of as compared to the first seven months of  which was prior to the issuance of the fda order 
cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of total human tissue preservation service revenues was in compared to in the decrease in cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of revenues was also due to the effects of the adjustments and write downs in and discussed above  partially offset by an increase in overhead allocations associated with lower tissue processing volumes  changes in processing methods resulting from the fda order  and a decrease in tissue shipments of valves treated with the higher margin synergraft process as compared to traditional processing 
the company anticipates cost of human tissue preservation services will increase in when compared to  due to projected increases in cryopreservation service revenues during the cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of revenue will continue to be high compared to pre fda order levels as a result of lower tissue processing volumes and changes in processing methods  which have increased the cost of processing human tissue 
decreases in cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of preservation service revenues in the long term are contingent on the company s ability to reestablish sufficient margins on its tissue preservation services by increasing the amount of tissues processed  decreasing tissue processing times  and increasing yields of implantable tissue per donor 
the cost of human tissue preservation services may be favorably affected in by shipments of tissue with a cost basis that has previously been written down to zero  but such impact is not expected to be material 
the write downs of deferred preservation costs during created a new cost basis  which cannot be written back up when these tissues are shipped or become available for shipment 
cost of products cost of products aggregated million in compared to million in the decrease in cost of products in was primarily due to a million write down of bioprosthetic valves  including synergraft and non synergraft treated porcine valves  in the third quarter of due to the company s decision to stop future expenditures on the development and marketing of these valves and to maintain its focus on its preservation services business and its bioglue and synergraft bovine vascular graft product lines 
the remaining increase in cost of products was due to higher bioglue sales levels during when compared to cost of products as a percentage of total product revenues was in compared to in the decrease is primarily due to the write down in discussed above 
the remaining decrease was due to a favorable product mix driven by an increase in revenues from bioglue surgical adhesive  which carries higher gross margins than bioprosthetic devices 
the company anticipates aggregate cost of products will increase slightly in when compared to  primarily due to projected increases in bioglue revenues during general  administrative  and marketing expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the increase in expenses was primarily due to an accrual of million for the estimated and actual expense to resolve ongoing product liability claims in excess of insurance coverage  million for estimated unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december   and  for required insurance retention payments for the company s product liability insurance policies related to prior policy years see legal proceedings at part i item for further discussion of these items 
general  administrative  and marketing costs in were unfavorably impacted by a million accrual for estimated product loss claims incurred but not reported as of december  and a million accrual for retention levels under the company s liability and directors and officers insurance policies 
additional increases in costs for were due to an increase of approximately million in professional fees legal  consulting  and accounting due to increased litigation and issues surrounding the fda order and subsequent fda activity and an increase of approximately million in insurance premiums  offset by a million decrease in marketing expenses  including personnel costs and sales commissions 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses in both periods were impacted by increased insurance costs  legal costs  and professional fees as compared to pre fda order levels 
the company anticipates general  administrative  and marketing expenses will decrease in when compared to  as the large accruals recorded in related to product liability claims are not expected to recur in the company anticipates that insurance costs  legal costs  and professional fees will continue to be higher in than those experienced prior to the fda order 
the company will continue to evaluate the level of accruals for product liability claims and make adjustments as required based on periodic actuarial analyses and product liability claim status 
adjustments to these accruals may be required during  and the effect of these adjustments may be favorable or unfavorable to general  administrative  and marketing expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in  compared to million in  representing of total revenues during these periods 
the decrease in research and development spending for year ended december  was primarily due to a delay in the timing of several external research studies  which are expected to take place in future periods  due to the company s focus on process improvements and addressing fda compliance requirements 
research and development spending in was primarily focused on the company s core tissue cryopreservation  synergraft  and protein hydrogel technologies 
research and development spending in was primarily focused on the company s synergraft and protein hydrogel technologies 
the company anticipates research and development expenses will increase slightly in when compared to  but those expenses should continue to represent approximately of total revenues 
other costs and expenses goodwill impairment of million in consists of a write down for impairment of goodwill related to the company s tissue processing reporting unit recorded in the third quarter of as discussed in critical accounting policies above 
interest expense decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was due to the company s reduced debt balances in as compared to  as a result of scheduled principal payments which reduced the level of outstanding debt  and the company s pay off of the outstanding balance of the term loan in the third quarter of these decreases were partially offset by additional interest expense related to the company s financing of million in insurance premiums associated with the yearly renewal of certain insurance policies 
interest income decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was due to the company s reduced balances of cash and marketable securities during as compared to  as the company sold investments and used cash balances to support ongoing operations and resolve product liability claims

the bioglue increases were primarily attributable to the receipt of fda approval in december for the use of bioglue in the us as an adjunct to sutures and staples in open surgical repair of large vessels for adult patients 
revenues as reported decreased for the twelve months ended december  revenues were adversely impacted by the estimated effect of the return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of million in preservation service revenues during the twelve months ended december  as discussed below  the estimated amount of recall returns includes credits for tissues actually returned to the company to date and the expected credits for future tissues to be returned to the company as a result of the fda order 
no adjustments were made to the original estimate of recall returns as actual returns to date have approximated the original estimate of recall returns

revenues as reported from cardiovascular preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  in addition to the factors discussed above  the revenues as reported from cardiovascular preservation services were adversely impacted by the estimated effect of the non valved cardiac tissues returned subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of  in service revenues during the twelve months ended december  vascular preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported     vascular revenues as reported as a percentage of total revenue as reported adjusted revenues a     vascular adjusted revenues as a percentage of total adjusted revenues a adjusted revenues from human vascular tissue preservation services decreased and  respectively  for the three and twelve months ended december  this decrease in revenues for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was primarily due to a decline in customer demand due to the adverse publicity surrounding the fda order  certain reported tissue infections  and the restrictions on shipments of certain tissues subject to the fda order 
revenues as reported from human vascular tissue preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  in addition to the factors discussed above  the revenues as reported from vascular tissue preservation services were adversely impacted by the estimated effect of the return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of million in vascular preservation service revenues during the twelve months ended december  orthopaedic preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported    orthopaedic revenues as reported as a percentage of total revenue as reported adjusted revenues a    orthopaedic adjusted revenues as a percentage of total adjusted revenues a adjusted revenues from human orthopaedic tissue preservation services decreased and for the three and twelve months ended december  this decrease in revenues for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was primarily due to a decline in customer demand due to the adverse publicity surrounding the fda order  certain reported tissue infections  cessation of processing of orthopaedic tissue  and the restrictions on shipments of tissues subject to the fda order 
revenues since august  have been from shipments of orthopaedic tissues that were processed prior to october  revenues as reported from human orthopaedic tissue preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  in addition to the factors discussed above  the revenues as reported from orthopaedic tissue preservation services were adversely impacted by the estimated effect of the return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of  in orthopaedic preservation service revenues during the twelve months ended december  bioprosthetic devices revenues from bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices increased to  in from  in  representing of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in the demand for the company s synergraft bovine vascular grafts which received ce mark approval in august distribution and grant revenues grant revenues decreased to  in from  in grant revenues in both years were primarily attributable to the synergraft research and development programs 
distribution revenues increased to  in from  in distribution revenues are for commissions received for the distribution of orthopaedic tissues for another processor

cost of human tissue preservation services aggregated million in fourth quarter of compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total human tissue preservation service revenues during each period 
the increase in the full year cost of preservation was due to the million write down of deferred preservation costs recorded in the second and third quarters of related to the fda order see item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation 
the decrease in the fourth quarter cost of preservation was due to decreased demand and shipments of tissue for which approximately million of deferred preservation costs that were written off in the second and third quarter of cost of products cost of products aggregated million in compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total product revenues during such periods 
cost of products aggregated million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the fourth quarter of  representing and  respectively  of total product revenues during such periods 
the cost of products includes a million write down of bioprosthetic valves  including synergraft and non synergraft treated porcine valves  in the third quarter of due to the company s decision to stop future expenditures on the development and marketing of these valves and to maintain its focus on its preservation services business  and its bioglue and synergraft vascular graft product lines 
the decrease in the fourth quarter cost of products as a percentage of total product revenues is due to a favorable product mix that was impacted by the increase in revenues from bioglue surgical adhesive  which carries higher gross margins than bioprosthetic devices 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the increase in expenditures for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increased overhead costs in connection with the expansion of the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility  which was substantially completed in the first quarter of  a million accrual for estimated product loss claims that have been incurred but not reported as of december   an increase of million in insurance premiums  an increase of million in legal and accounting costs due to the response to the fda order and increased litigation  a million accrual for retention levels under the company s liability and directors and officers insurance policies  additional professional fees of million required to address the observations detailed in the warning letter and severance and related costs of approximately  due to the reduction in employee force of approximately employees

seasonality the demand for the company s cardiovascular tissue preservation services is seasonal  with peak demand generally occurring in the second and third quarters 
management believes this trend for cardiovascular tissue preservation services is primarily due to the high number of surgeries scheduled during the summer months for school aged patients  who drive the demand for a large percentage of cryolife s cardiovascular tissues 
the demand for the company s bioglue surgical adhesive appears to experience some seasonality  with a flattening or slight decline in demand generally occurring in the third quarter followed by stronger demand in the fourth quarter 
management believes that this trend for bioglue may be due to fewer surgeries being performed on adult patients in the summer months 
as bioglue is in a high growth phase generally associated with a recently introduced product that has not fully penetrated the marketplace  the full nature of any seasonal trends in bioglue sales may be obscured 
the company will continue to evaluate the seasonal nature of bioglue sales 
the demand for the company s human vascular and orthopaedic tissue preservation services and bioprosthetic cardiovascular and vascular devices does not appear to experience seasonal trends 
liquidity and capital resources net working capital at december  net working capital current assets of million less current liabilities of million was million  with a current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities of to  compared to net working capital of million  with a current ratio of to at december  the company s primary capital requirements historically arose out of general working capital needs  capital expenditures for facilities and equipment  and funding of research and development projects  and the company funded those requirements through cash generated by operations  equity offerings  and bank credit facilities 
in the company s primary capital requirements arose out of working capital needs created by increasing costs of operations combined with decreasing revenues due to the effects of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events as discussed in item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation 
specifically  the company had costs related to its employees and recently expanded corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities during a period of reduced tissue processing and reduced tissue service revenues 
operating results were also negatively impacted by increases in general  administrative  and marketing costs as a result of increased legal and professional fees and settlement costs as discussed in the results of operations section above 
liquidity was further impacted by cash used in financing activities as discussed below 
the company funded these requirements primarily through sales and maturities of marketable securities totaling million and the receipt of significant tax refunds totaling million during the year 
overall liquidity and capital resources the company expects that its operations will continue to generate negative cash flows over the next twelve months due to o the anticipated lower preservation revenues as compared to preservation revenues prior to the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events  o the increase in cost of human tissue preservation services as a percent of revenue as a result of lower tissue processing volumes and changes in processing methods  o an expected use of cash related to the defense and resolution of lawsuits discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and o the legal and professional costs related to its ongoing fda compliance 
the company has obtained additional equity financing subsequent to december   discussed below  and management believes that this funding coupled with anticipated revenue generation  expense management  tax refunds expected to be approximately million  and the company s existing cash and marketable securities will enable the company to meet its liquidity needs through at least december  on january  the company s board of directors authorized an agreement with a financial advisory company to sell shares of the company s common stock in a private investment in public equity transaction the pipe 
the pipe was consummated on january   and resulted in the sale of million shares of stock at a price of per share 
the sale generated net proceeds of approximately million  after commissions  registration fees  and other related charges  which will be used for general corporate purposes 
on february  the company filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the resale of the shares sold in the pipe by the investors 
the company has agreed to pay of the aggregate purchase price per month  subject to certain limitations  if the registration statement is not declared effective within days of the closing date of january  the company s long term liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including o the company s ability to return to the level of demand for its tissue services that existed prior to the fda order  o the company s ability to reestablish sufficient margins on its tissue preservation services in the face of increased processing costs  o the company s spending levels on its research and development activities  including research studies  to develop and support its product pipeline  o the outcome of litigation against the company discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and o the amount and the timing of the resolution of the remaining outstanding product liability claims discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company may require additional financing or seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings  or other sources of capital to meet liquidity and capital requirements beyond december  additional funds may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  at december  the company had million remaining in an accrual for the estimated expense of resolving the remaining outstanding product liability claims in excess of insurance coverage 
the million accrual is an estimate of the costs required to resolve outstanding claims  and does not reflect actual settlement arrangements or judgments  including punitive damages  which may be assessed by the courts 
the million accrual is not a cash reserve 
the timing of actual future payments related to the accrual is dependent on when and if judgments are rendered  and or settlements are reached 
should payments related to the accrual be required  these monies would have to be paid from liquid assets 
the company continues to attempt to reach settlements of these outstanding claims in order to minimize the potential cash payout 
see additional discussion of these matters in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if the company is unable to settle the outstanding claims for amounts within its ability to pay or one or more of the product liability lawsuits in which the company is a defendant should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  such verdict s could exceed the company s liquid assets 
there is a possibility that significant punitive damages could be assessed in one or more lawsuits which would have to be paid out of the liquid assets of the company  if available 
in addition  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  at december  the company had million remaining in an accrual for the estimated costs of unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  the million accrual does not represent cash set aside 
the timing of future payments related to the accrual is dependent on when and if claims are asserted  judgments are rendered  and or settlements are reached 
should payments related to the accrual be required  these monies would have to be paid from insurance proceeds and liquid assets 
since the amount accrued is based on actuarial estimates  actual amounts required could vary significantly from this estimate 
net cash from operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million in  as compared to million in the million of cash used in was primarily due to a decrease in revenues and an increase in cash expenditures  both of which are related to the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events  as discussed in item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation 
spending  including the cost of employees and facilities  was not sufficiently supported by cash received from revenues 
increased spending on general and administrative expenses from increased professional fees and legal and settlement costs also contributed to the cash shortfall in operations 
the company uses the indirect method to prepare its cash flow statement  and as such the operating cash flows are based on the company s net loss income  which is then adjusted to remove all non cash items 
the company s net loss from operations included significant recurring non cash items in the normal course of business that generated favorable and unfavorable adjustments to net income 
these adjustments included a favorable million in depreciation and  in amortization  a favorable  due to the timing differences between the recording of accounts receivable and the actual receipt of cash from customers  an unfavorable million due to the buildup of deferred preservation costs for which vendors and employees have already been paid  a favorable million primarily due to prepaid insurance  and an unfavorable million due to the timing differences between the recording of accounts payable and the actual payment of cash to vendors and employees 
the company s net loss from operations also included significant non cash items  which are unusual or not expected to recur  that generated favorable and unfavorable adjustments to net income 
these adjustments included a favorable million in write downs for impairment of deferred preservation costs  a favorable million due to valuation reserves placed on the company s deferred tax assets  a favorable million in income tax receivables largely due to the receipt of million in tax refunds which were recorded during the previous year  and a favorable million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to accruals for expected future product liability expenditures as discussed above 
the company anticipates that cash from operations will continue to be negative in this cash used will primarily be a result of the company s projected net loss for the company does not currently expect that it will be required to record significant additional non cash write downs of inventory or additional significant accruals related to product liabilities during  but such items would not have a direct effect on net cash from operations 
significant additional cash payments related to settlements  as discussed above  could have a negative impact on future cash flows 
the company anticipates that it will continue to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated from operating losses and to record write downs of deferred preservation costs which exceed market value  but such items would not have a direct effect on net cash from operations 
the company expects to receive tax refunds totaling million in  which is substantially less than the million received in net cash from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in  as compared to million in the million in current year cash provided was primarily due to million in cash generated from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
this cash was used to fund the company s operations  which used million in cash during as discussed above and to pay down the company s term loan as discussed below 
the company generated an additional million in cash from investing activities through the sale of a parcel of land adjacent to the company s existing corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities 
the company also used cash of  for capital spending in  primarily to purchase equipment to support process changes in the company s tissue processing laboratory and microbiology department and for equipment and leasehold improvements related to the creation of an in house pathology department during net cash from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  as compared to million in the million in cash used in was primarily due to million in principal payments on the term loan  including a lump sum payment of million in the third quarter of to pay off the remaining balance of the term loan as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition the company used cash of million to make principal payments on a note payable  which financed the company s insurance policy renewals for the policy year  and  in principal payments on the company s capital leases 
the company generated  in cash from financing activities as a result of the purchase of stock by the company s employees through the employee stock purchase program and through the exercise of company stock options 
scheduled contractual obligations and future payments scheduled contractual obligations and the related future payments are as follows in thousands total thereafter capital lease obligations  operating leases      purchase commitments total contractual obligations     the company s capital lease obligations result from the financing of certain of the company s equipment and leasehold improvements during the renovation of the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities in previous years 
due to cross default provisions included in the company s term loan which was paid in full on august   the company was in default of certain capital lease agreements maintained with the lender under the term loan as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the million due under these capital leases is reflected as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and additional capital lease obligations result from the lease of a building related to company s ideas for medicine ifm manufacturing business  which the company sold in the company has a sublease agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of lemaitre vascular  inc  the current parent of ifm  to sublet the building housing the ifm manufacturing facilities  which effectively reduces the company s future obligations under this capital lease to zero 
the company s operating lease obligations result from the lease of land and buildings that comprise the company s corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities  leases related to additional manufacturing  office  and warehouse space rented by the company  leases on company vehicles  and leases on a variety of office equipment 
the company s purchase commitments result from an exclusive agreement with curasan ag for us distribution of cerasorb ortho bone graft substitute 
cryolife is in the process of negotiating a settlement with curasan for the dissolution of the distribution agreement and resolution of the guaranteed purchase requirements for additional purchase commitments result from agreements with suppliers to stock certain custom raw materials needed for the company s processing and production 
interest rate swap agreement the company s term loan  which was paid in full on august   accrued interest computed at adjusted libor plus  and exposed the company to changes in interest rates going forward 
on march  the company entered into a million notional amount forward starting interest swap agreement  which took effect on june  and was to expire in this swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge to effectively convert a portion of the term loan balance to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
this agreement involved the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement  without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the differential to be paid or received was recognized in the period in which it accrued as an adjustment to interest expense on the term loan 
in august the company determined that changes in the derivative s fair value could no longer be recorded in other comprehensive income  as a result of the uncertainty of future cash payments on the term loan caused by the lender s ability to declare an event of default as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
beginning in august the company began recording all changes in the fair value of the derivative into other expense income on the consolidated statements of operations  and amortized the amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income into other expense income over the remaining life of the swap agreement 
during the quarter ended june  the company became aware of the lender s intention to accelerate the payment of the term loan  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the company recorded an expense of  to reclassify the unamortized portion of the other comprehensive loss to other expense income on the consolidated statements of operations 
in conjunction with the payoff of the outstanding balance of the term loan  the company paid  to terminate the swap agreement 
this  payment represents the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap  as estimated by the bank based on its internal valuation models  as of the day of the termination of the agreement 
for the year ended december  the company recorded a total expense of  related to the interest rate swap 
stock repurchase on july  the company s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million in shares of its common stock 
the purchase of shares was to be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions on such terms as management deemed appropriate 
as of december  the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  and an average price of per share 
the company did not repurchase any common stock in this purchase authorization expired during  therefore no further purchases will be made under this authorization

as of december   the company had purchased an aggregate of million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million and an average price of per share 
on february  the company s board of directors rescinded its purchase authorizations dated march  and october   therefore no further purchases will be made under these authorizations 
capital expenditures the company expects that its capital expenditures in will show a modest increase over its expenditures in  which were approximately million 
capital expenditures in were restricted due to the company s cash position 
the company expects to have the flexibility to increase or decrease the majority of its planned capital expenditures depending on its ability to rebuild its tissue processing business and maintain adequate cash flows 
the company does not currently anticipate any major purchase of equipment as a result of the fda inspections of its facilities
