a substantial portion of accounts receivable is concentrated among major national retailers

the current portion of long term debt decreased million due primarily to a million principal payment on a medium term note 
long term debt increased million due primarily to the issuance of million of medium term notes  the proceeds of which were used principally to pay down commercial paper

maytag hedges a portion of its anticipated foreign currency denominated export sales transactions  which are denominated primarily in canadian dollars 
at january   a uniform percent strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which maytag s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in net income of approximately million for the year ending january  this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
maytag also is exposed to commodity price risk related to its purchase of selected commodities used in the manufacturing of its products 
commodity swap agreements are entered into reducing the effect of changing raw material prices for selected commodities 
at january   a uniform percent increase in the price of commodities covered by commodity swap agreements would result in an increase of thousand in fair market value of the commodity swap agreements 
for all commodities  a uniform percent increase in the price of future purchases of commodities would have a material impact on operational results 
maytag also is exposed to interest rate risk in the portfolio of its debt 
maytag uses interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount

the company has provided these non gaap measurements as a way to help investors better understand its earnings and enhance comparisons of the company s earnings from period to period 
among other things  the company s management uses the earnings results  excluding items affecting comparability  to evaluate the performance of its businesses 
there are inherent limitations in the use of earnings  excluding items affecting comparability  because the company s actual results do include the impact of these items 
the non gaap measures are intended only as a supplement to the comparable gaap measures and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non gaap measures by using gaap measures in conjunction with the non gaap measures 
as a result  investors should consider these non gaap measures in addition to  and not in substitution for  or as superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

table of contents critical accounting policies the following accounting policies and practices are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of maytag s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for doubtful accounts maytag determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by utilizing various methodologies 
bad debt reserves are established based on an aging of accounts receivables and applying percentages based on historical experience to age categories 
in addition  where maytag is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  it specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be revised by a material amount 
pensions maytag provides noncontributory defined benefit pensions for most of its employees 
plans covering salaried  management and some nonunion hourly employees generally provide pension benefits that are based on employee s earnings and credited service 
plans covering union hourly and other nonunion hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service 
maytag s funding policy for the plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of erisa  plus any additional amounts that maytag may determine to be appropriate 
maytag accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the consolidated balance sheets representing the amount of unfunded accrued pension cost 
the unfunded accrued pension cost is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets 
as allowed by fasb statement no 
 the company uses september as a measurement date to compute the minimum pension liability 
in  certain maytag employees were given a one time opportunity to transfer their pension to a cash balance pension plan 
approximately of all the company s employees became participants in the cash balance plan 
to account for its defined benefit plans in accordance with fasb statement no 
 maytag must make three principal assumptions as of the measurement date first  it must determine the discount rate to be used to compute the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  maytag looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments 
at january   the rate utilized to determine the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation was percent compared to percent and percent used for and  respectively 
second  maytag must determine rates of increase in compensation levels to be used in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
at january   this rate for salaried employees was percent compared to percent and percent for and at january  and december  the rate for non union hourly employees was percent compared to percent at december  any changes in assumptions that affect the projected benefit obligation are deferred to unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses is recognized when the cumulative total is outside of a corridor that is defined by fasb statement no 
as the greater of percent of the projected benefit obligation or percent of the market value of plan assets 

table of contents third  as another component of net periodic pension cost  maytag must determine the expected return on plan assets 
in order to reduce volatility in the calculation of pension cost  fasb statement no 
requires the utilization of an expected rate of return on plan assets 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is included with other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
the expected rate of return is based on the asset allocation within the plan assets as well as the historical and future expected returns for each of the asset classes within the portfolio 
the future expected returns on the asset classes are based on current market factors such as interest rates and expected market returns 
maytag determines the asset return component of net periodic pension cost on a market related valuation of assets that smoothes actual returns and reduces year to year net periodic pension cost volatility 
as of january   maytag had cumulative asset losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
at january  and december   the assumption for the expected rate of return was percent for determining net periodic pension cost as compared to percent at december maytag employs a total investment return approach whereby a mix of equity and debt securities are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk 
the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and debt securities 
furthermore  equity investments are diversified across domestic and international stocks as well as large and small capitalizations 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews  annual liability measurements and periodic asset liability studies 
the target allocation of equity securities is percent of the plan assets 
the target allocation of debt securities is percent of the plan assets 
the target allocations remained consistent for the and measurement dates 
at january   maytag s accrued pension cost was million  a decrease from million at the end of the decreased accrued pension cost was primarily due to a million contribution made in the fourth quarter of a minimum liability adjustment was recorded at january  due to a higher accumulated benefit obligation that was partially offset by a higher value of plan assets 
the accumulated benefit obligation increased based on one year of additional pension benefit accrual and the assumption of a lower discount rate used to calculate the liability 
the fair value of plan assets increased by million as gains on plan assets and employer contributions exceeded benefit payments 
the additional contribution of million  which was subsequent to the september   measurement date  reduced the accrued pension cost on the january   consolidated balance sheet from the million amount required by the minimum liability calculation 
net periodic pension cost decreased to million in from million in pension costs for included a curtailment charge of million for pension enhancements related to a salaried workforce reduction 
pension costs in included a million curtailment charge associated with the announced closing of a manufacturing plant for further discussion see restructuring charges in this management s discussion and analysis 
excluding the curtailment charges  pension cost increased due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses partially offset by lower service costs and amortization of prior service cost 
for  the company expects pension expenses to be equal to benefiting from increased pension contributions at the end of lowering the expected rate of return on plan assets by percent would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by percent would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
increasing the rate of increase in compensation levels by percent would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
pension contributions increased to million in from million in maytag has no minimum funding requirements in  based on erisa requirements 
however  the company intends to contribute a minimum of million in postretirement benefits maytag provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain employee groups in the united states 
most of the postretirement plans are contributory and contain certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the plans are unfunded 
employees do not vest and these benefits are subject to change 
death benefits for certain retired employees are funded as part of  and paid out of  pension plans 

table of contents maytag accounts for its postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that the postretirement liability be reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and the postretirement cost be recognized in the consolidated statements of income as determined on an actuarial basis 
the company uses a september measurement date to compute the postretirement liability 
to account for postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 
 maytag must make two main assumptions at the measurement date first  it must determine the discount rate used to compute the present value of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and the net periodic postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  maytag looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments 
at january   maytag determined this rate to be percent compared to percent and percent used for and  respectively 
second  maytag must determine the expected health care cost trend rate used in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and net periodic postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
at january   maytag adjusted this initial health care cost trend rate to percent from percent at december  the expected health care cost trend rate decreases gradually to percent in and thereafter 
at january   maytag s postretirement benefit liability was million  an increase from million at the end of for the year ended january   maytag incurred a net periodic postretirement cost of million  an increase from million in in  maytag incurred an million curtailment charge associated with the announced closing of a manufacturing plant for further discussion see restructuring charges in this management s discussion and analysis 
net periodic postretirement cost increased in due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and increased interest costs resulting from the higher postretirement benefit liability 
maytag currently expects that net periodic postretirement cost for will increase slightly from as the company negotiated a revised union contract with certain production employees 
in december  congress enacted the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare act  which includes subsidies for companies providing prescription drug benefits to retirees 
maytag s sfas postretirement benefit measurement date of september was before the enactment of this law and  therefore  the potential benefit of any changes in maytag s postretirement liability or expense is not reflected in the financial statements or accompanying notes included in the form k 
while maytag believes the impact of the law should significantly lower its postretirement liability expense  the company is still evaluating its prospective impact 
increasing the expected health care cost trend rate one percent would have increased net periodic postretirement cost for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by percent would have increased net periodic postretirement cost for by approximately million 
litigation and tax contingencies maytag is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings associated with employment  product liability or other matters 
maytag s law department estimates the costs to settle pending litigation  including legal expenses  based on its experience involving similar cases  specific facts known  and if applicable  the judgments of outside counsel 
maytag does not believe it is a party to any legal proceedings that will likely have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations  for any particular quarterly or annual period  could be materially affected by changes in maytag s assumptions related to these proceedings 

table of contents maytag s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities 
during the course of these audits  the authorities may question the positions taken in the return  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income between various tax jurisdictions  which can affect the amount of taxes ultimately due 
in evaluating the exposure associated with its various filing positions  maytag records reserves for probable exposures 
to the extent the company prevails in matters where accruals have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the accrual  the effective tax rate and net income in a given financial period may be impacted 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets maytag accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets whereby goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
the statement requires a two step process for impairment testing 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment only  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its net carrying amount on the financial statements 
fair value is determined as the amount at which the reporting unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement where available 
where these are not available  fair value of the reporting unit can be estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these cash flow estimates must be based on reasonable and supportable assumptions  and consider all available evidence 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired  thus the second step of the process is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the carrying value of goodwill on the financial statements exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  the difference must be recognized as an impairment loss 
implied fair value of goodwill shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
as of december   the initial impairment test and during the fourth quarters of and  maytag performed step one of the impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill exceeded the carrying value of the net assets specifically related to these reporting units 
goodwill included in the home appliance segment totaled million as of january   most of which related to the floor care product line 
goodwill included in the commercial appliance segment totaled million as of january   most of which related to the commercial cooking product line 
expected future cash flows for the reporting units tested was based on prospective assumptions as the company is undertaking additional business initiatives that are not currently reflected in the historical results 
maytag currently has no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 
segment reporting beginning in the first quarter of  maytag will change its segment reporting structure to three segments from two segments in as maytag aligns its internal reporting to reflect new initiatives and accountabilities within the company 
the new reporting segments will reflect internal reporting changes that have occurred as a result of new growth initiatives within the company
