item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our historical operating results 
inflation could materially adversely affect our operating results the majority of our operating expenses have increased due to inflation 
we have tried to offset these increases in operating expenses by increasing menu prices or by implementing other cost reduction procedures that has limited the overall impact from inflation 
because we are in a competitive industry  we may be limited in the amount of menu prices we can increase 
if we are unable to offset increases in operating expenses due to inflation  it could materially adversely affect or business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
increased energy costs and power outages may adversely affect our profitability our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs 
various regions of the united states in which we operate multiple restaurants  particularly california  have experienced significant and temporary increases in utility prices 
we have in the past closed restaurants on a temporary basis due to the inability to receive electrical power 
if these increases should recur  it may adversely affect our profitability 
increased food costs could materially adversely affect our operating results our profitability also depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
we rely on sysco corporation  a national food distributor  as the primary distributor of our food 
although we believe that alternative distribution sources are available  any increase in distribution prices or failure to perform by sysco could cause our food costs to increase 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions and governmental regulation  may affect our food costs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results our restaurants feature italian cuisine served primarily in small and large family style portions 
our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of this type of italian cuisine and this style of informal dining 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially adversely affect our future profitability 
also  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
we could face potential labor shortages our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including restaurant managers  kitchen staff and wait staff  necessary to keep pace with our expansion schedule 
qualified individuals 
table of contents needed to fill these positions are in short supply in certain areas  and the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
additionally  competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees  which could result in higher labor costs 
our operations depend on governmental licenses and complying with government regulations each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control  health  sanitation  safety and fire agencies in the state  county and or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals 
if we fail to hold all necessary licenses  we may be forced to delay or cancel new restaurant openings and close or reduce operations at existing locations 
we also are subject to federal and state environmental regulations and adverse changes in these regulations could have a material negative effect on our operations 
for example  more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the americans with disabilities act  various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted  or rules and regulations promulgated  by federal  state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters 
a material increase in the minimum wage and other statutory benefits could adversely affect our operating results and profitability 
we may face liability under dram shop statutes our sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to dram shop statutes in most states 
these statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person 
if we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage  or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
see item business government regulation for a discussion of the regulations we must comply with 
complaints or litigation and the related adverse publicity from guests may materially adversely affect us we are from time to time the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
these claims may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations 
multi unit restaurant businesses can also be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality  food born illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants 
in particular  since we depend heavily on the brands buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston for all of our revenues  unfavorable publicity relating to one or more buca di beppo or vinny t s of boston restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we may be unable to fund our significant future capital needs and we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated we may need substantial capital to finance our expansion plans  which require funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and potential initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we will have to curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
moreover  if we issue additional equity securities  the holdings of existing shareholders may be diluted 
although we expect that borrowings under our credit facility  combined with other resources will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements at least through fiscal  this may not be the case 
our credit facility limits our capital expenditures in future years  including a maximum of million in fiscal we may be required to seek additional capital earlier than anticipated if future actual cash flows from operations fail to meet our expectations  
table of contents costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development exceed anticipated amounts  landlord contributions  loans and other incentives are lower than expected  we are required to reduce prices to respond to competitive pressures  we are able to secure a greater number of attractive development sites than currently anticipated  or we are unable to achieve the required bank covenants 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our historical and anticipated capital needs 
we may suffer from uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business we have comprehensive insurance  including general liability  fire  extended coverage and employee practices liability coverage 
however  there are certain types of losses that may be uninsurable or that we believe are not economically insurable  such as earthquakes  other natural disasters  and terrorist attacks 
in view of the location of many of our existing and planned restaurants in california and other earthquake prone areas of the united states  our operations are susceptible to damage and disruption caused by earthquakes 
in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster affecting one or more geographic areas of our operations  we could suffer a loss of the capital invested in  as well as anticipated earnings from  the damaged or destroyed properties 
the terrorist attacks on the united states had a significant impact on the portion of our business that is celebratory in nature and adversely affected our restaurant sales and profitability 
with the threats of additional terrorists attacks and continuing uncertainty created by the war on terrorism  there could be a potential downturn in the economy and a decrease in consumer spending 
these factors  as well as the effects of adverse publicity to our business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

our buca di beppo restaurants are full service  primarily dinner only restaurants that offer high quality  immigrant southern italian cuisine served family style in small and large family sized portions in a fun and energetic atmosphere that parodies the decor and ambiance of post war italian american restaurants 
our vinny t s of boston restaurants serve individual and family style portions for both lunch and dinner

we intend to open three new buca di beppo restaurants and one new vinny t s of boston restaurant in fiscal all have leases signed and two are under construction 
in an effort to attract smaller parties and allow our guests to try a wider variety of our menu items  we introduced smaller portion sizes for a majority of entrees on our menu 
we expect our buca small initiative to be implemented in all of our buca di beppo restaurants by april we also expect to begin to publicize our buca small menu during the first half of fiscal

we are also in the process of implementing our lunch program in approximately of our buca di beppo restaurants over the next months

table of contents week fiscal year ended december  compared to week fiscal year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in restaurant sales was a result of new buca di beppo restaurants and one vinny t s of boston restaurant opened in fiscal and a full year of sales on new buca di beppo restaurants opened in fiscal our buca di beppo comparable restaurants sales decreased by in fiscal our vinny t s of boston comparable restaurant sales decreased in fiscal our buca di beppo average weekly sales declined to  in fiscal from  in fiscal our vinny t s of boston average weekly sales declined to  in fiscal from  in fiscal both of these reductions in comparable restaurant sales and average weekly sales were due to a reduction in guest counts 
we increased prices approximately at buca di beppo on the first day of fiscal and approximately at vinny t s of boston in march we expect to increase prices approximately at buca di beppo with the introduction of our buca small menu program by april we have not taken a price increase at vinny t s of boston in fiscal product 
product costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal product costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales to in fiscal from in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of stronger purchasing contracts for a number of key products  change in accounting for contributions from our product vendors for our paisano management conference  and a price increase implemented at buca di beppo and a price increase implemented at our vinny t s of boston restaurants in fiscal we expect product costs to remain constant as a percentage of sales in fiscal from fiscal labor 
labor costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the primary reason for the increase in labor costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal was the decline in average weekly sales at both buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston 
our hourly labor increased  management payroll increased  and payroll taxes and benefits increased  as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect labor costs to remain constant as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal direct and occupancy 
direct and occupancy costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal direct and occupancy costs increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in direct and occupancy costs  which are primarily fixed in nature  as a percentage of sales was directly related to the decline in average weekly sales and rising insurance  property tax and utility costs 
we anticipate direct and occupancy costs to increase slightly as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared with fiscal the expected increase in direct and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales is due to expected increases in our marketing expenses from of sales in fiscal to approximately in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of depreciation recognized on capital expenditures for new restaurants 
the million loss on impairment of long lived assets taken in fiscal for our restaurants currently in operation will decrease the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that we will need to incur for those restaurants in future years 
we expect depreciation and amortization expenses to increase slightly in fiscal from fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales was due to the decline in average weekly sales and a million increase related to a change in our method of accounting for vendor contributions related to our annual paisano management conference 
in years previous to fiscal  we had recorded vendor contributions to our paisano management conference as a reduction in general and administrative costs 
in fiscal  we began to record these contributions as a reduction in the related product or direct and occupancy cost 
the change was made in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting by a customer for certain consideration received from a vendor 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the method of accounting for vendor contributions 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal primarily because of reductions related to our slow down in new restaurant development 
pre opening costs 
pre opening costs decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal pre opening costs decreased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in pre opening costs as a percentage of sales was due to management s efforts to reduce these costs to our model of  per new restaurant opening and due to increased sales on a larger base of restaurants 
we expect that pre opening costs will decrease significantly as a percentage of sales as we expect to open new restaurants in fiscal compared to new restaurants opened in fiscal loss on impairment of long lived assets 
loss on impairment of long lived assets increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the loss on impairment of long lived assets in fiscal primarily related to a million write down of nine buca di beppo restaurants currently in operation as well as a million 
table of contents impairment taken on capitalized development costs for restaurants which we do not expect to open 
the impairment of long lived assets at restaurants in operation was required because management determined that the value of future undiscounted cash flows did not support the carrying value of assets 
the impairment of assets for unopened restaurants was due to a reduction in our development plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our losses on impairment of long lived assets 
the loss on impairment of long lived assets in fiscal related to capitalized development costs for restaurants which we do not expect to open 
interest income 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal interest income is related to the interest payments on loans we receive from our paisano partners in accordance with our paisano partner program 
we expect that interest income in fiscal will increase slightly from fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense related to increased borrowings and a higher interest rate on our term loan and line of credit facilities 
we completed a private sale of shares of our common stock in february and used the net proceeds of approximately million to pay down borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
we expect interest expense to decrease in fiscal from fiscal due to decreased borrowings on our amended credit facility 
early extinguishment of debt 
there was no early extinguishment of debt charge in fiscal early extinguishment of debt charges of  taken in fiscal related to deferred loan acquisition costs on our credit facility that was replaced in october we expect to take approximately  in early extinguishment of debt charges in the first quarter of fiscal due to the partial repayment of debt under our amended credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further information regarding the private placement of our common stock in february and amendments to our current credit facility 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a million benefit from income taxes in fiscal we incurred a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal because of the decline in our profitability in fiscal  we recorded a million tax valuation allowance against our long term deferred tax assets in fiscal the benefit from income taxes in fiscal and provision for income taxes in fiscal both represented our best estimate of our ultimate income tax effects related to each fiscal year 
we will continue to record a tax valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that we will be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets 
week fiscal year ended december  compared to week fiscal year ended december  restaurant sales

product 
product costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal product costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales to in fiscal from in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of stronger purchasing contracts for a number of key products  the increased sale of baked specialties and specials that have higher product margins and the price increase implemented at our buca di beppo restaurants in march labor 
labor costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal a improvement in hourly labor as a percentage of sales was offset by the increase as a percentage of sales of primarily fixed management payroll and benefits costs 
the increase in management payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales was due to the decline in average weekly sales and the addition of vinny t s of boston 
vinny t s of boston s labor costs as a percentage of sales are higher than those of buca di beppo because the vinny t s of boston restaurants serve lunch  which has a lower margin than dinner 
direct and occupancy 
direct and occupancy costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal direct and occupancy costs increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in direct and occupancy costs  which are primarily fixed in nature  as a percentage of sales was directly related to the decline in average weekly sales and a increase in marketing spending

loss on impairment of long lived assets 
the loss on impairment of long lived assets declined million to  in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the loss on impairment of long lived assets in fiscal related to the write off of capitalized development costs on restaurants which we do not expect to open because of a reduction in our development plans 
the loss on impairment of long lived assets in fiscal related primarily to a million asset impairment charge taken at our lowest sales volume restaurant because the estimated future undiscounted cash flows did not support the value of fixed assets at that location 
interest income 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease in interest income is related to a lower amount of invested assets during the year and lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in interest expense related to increased borrowings on our term loan and line of credit facilities 
early extinguishment of debt 
early extinguishment of debt charges of  taken in fiscal related to deferred loan acquisition costs on our credit facility that was replaced in october provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of million in fiscal  which is of pre tax income  represents our estimated tax liability for the year 
our tax rate increased slightly from fiscal primarily due to increased state income taxes and the reduced impact of the income tax credit we receive for social security paid on reported tips 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal   and primarily related to net loss income plus the value of non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization and the loss on impairment of long lived assets 
we expect to continue to generate cash from operating activities in future periods 
we use cash primarily to fund the development and construction of new restaurants 
net capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we opened buca di beppo restaurants and one vinny t s of boston restaurant in fiscal as compared to new buca di beppo restaurants in fiscal and new buca di beppo restaurants in fiscal in january  we purchased nine vinny t s of boston restaurants for approximately million 
each new buca di beppo or vinny t s of boston leased restaurant is expected to require  on average  a total cash investment of between million and million  excluding pre opening costs expected to be approximately  for a buca di beppo and  for a vinny t s of boston restaurant 
since  we have been building restaurants based upon our prototype designs 
these designs are expected to require between million to million in total cash investment per restaurant 
this investment represents an incremental  increase over the historical cash investment for remodeled restaurants 
in fiscal  we received million from the sale of property and equipment 
the majority of these funds were related to the million sale and leaseback of our st 
paul restaurant in june the net book value at the time of the sale was million  thus creating a million deferred gain on the sale and leaseback of the restaurant 
this deferred gain will be recognized over the remainder of the year initial operating lease term 
we have and may continue to refinance any purchases of land or buildings through sale leaseback transactions 
our current credit facility restricts our ability to complete certain types of sale leaseback transactions 
we cannot predict whether this financing will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
on january   our board of directors and management reached a decision to cancel the development of a number of restaurant sites 
at two of these sites  we had already executed operating lease agreements and have been making monthly lease payments of approximately  these leases were established during fiscal and and have initial non cancelable terms of to years 
during fiscal  we expect to incur certain charges to exit such leases 
the fair value of these charges will be estimated in accordance with the accounting standards as documented in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or dispersal activities 
this will require that we negotiate a settlement with the landlord or estimate the present value of the future minimum lease obligations offset by the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the properties 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of borrowings on our line of credit and payments of our term loan 
the net proceeds from our debt borrowings were primarily used to fund the development of new buca di beppo and one new vinny t s of boston restaurant 
financing activities in fiscal consisted of borrowings and payments on credit facilities completed in january and october of that year 
the proceeds from those two credit facilities were primarily used to purchase 
table of contents vinny t s of boston in january and fund the development of new buca di beppo restaurants 
financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of the sales of equity securities in a private investment in a public entity pipe  primarily to help fund the development of new buca di beppo restaurants 
in october  we closed on a credit facility comprised of a million term loan and a million line of credit facility with the option to borrow an additional million under the line of credit provided we are not in default under the terms of the loan agreement at the time 
the revolving credit facility expires on october  we were required to pay back million annually in principal toward the term loan during fiscal through principal payments are to be made on a quarterly basis 
the revolving credit facility bore interest at the lower of our lenders reference rate plus to or eurodollar rate plus to  dependent upon our meeting certain financial ratios 
we are required to pay on all unused line of credit funds 
the credit agreement contains covenants that place restrictions on sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  creation of additional debt  limitations on capital expenditures and other customary covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
in november  we amended our credit agreement 
under this amendment  which waived certain financial covenant defaults  we paid a fee of approximately  the agreement also increased the interest rate to the lower of our lenders reference rate plus to or eurodollar rate plus to to as of march  
the amended credit agreement contains covenants that place restriction on sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  creation of additional debt  limitations on capital expenditures  maintenance of certain financial ratios  eliminates future sale leaseback transactions and includes other customary covenants 
in february  we further amended our credit facility 
the amendment  which waived certain financial covenant defaults  required us to pay million as a permanent reduction in our term loan facility and changed the maturity date of the term loan facility from october  to october  of the million in payments against the term loan  million was applied to the required term loan payments in fiscal the remaining million was applied evenly against the required term loan payments for fiscal years through thus  our revised term loan requirement is to pay  annually for fiscal years through these payments are required to be made evenly over the four quarters of each fiscal year 
the amendment changed certain financial covenants and eliminated our minimum interest coverage ratio requirement 
our annual capital expenditures are limited as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal also  the amendment limits our ability to incur capital expenditures for new restaurants and sign leases for new restaurant locations 
we were required to pay a waiver fee of  at march   we had million outstanding on our term loan and million outstanding on our line of credit 
on february   we completed the sale of million shares of buca  inc stock at a price of per share for total gross proceeds of  after deducting equity transaction costs of approximately million  we received net proceeds from the equity sale of approximately million  million of which was used to prepay our term loan facility and million of which was used to pay down our line of credit borrowings 
our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
we expect our capital requirements in fiscal to be approximately million  which is the limit established under our credit facility 
we have slowed down our development for fiscal until we have developed appropriate strategies to improve our comparable restaurant sales trends 
we may need substantial capital to finance our expansion plans  which require funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
the adequacy of available funds and our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  the costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development and the nature of contributions  loans and other arrangements negotiated with landlords 
although we can make no assurance  we believe that our available cash  cash flows from operations  and our available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements through at least to fund future operations  we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financing to continue our growth 
in addition  we have and may continue to consider acquiring the operations of other companies 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we cannot predict whether additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our capital expenditures in fiscal included development of a training facility in sermenino  italy 
as of december    had been invested in the land and other site development costs 
we estimate the additional cost to complete construction of the facility to be approximately off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of buca  inc and all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
this analysis is done on annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we consider a history of operating losses to be a primary indicator of potential asset impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  primarily the individual restaurants 
a restaurant is deemed to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the restaurant is less than its carrying amount 
if a restaurant is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant exceeds its fair value 
fair value is an estimate based on the best information available including estimated future cash flows  expected growth rates in comparable restaurant sales  remaining lease terms and other factors 
in fiscal  and we recorded asset impairment charges related to the write down of restaurants in operation because the value of estimated future cash flows for those restaurants did not support the carrying value of their respective restaurant assets or because the capitalized developed costs became impaired for restaurants which we did not expect to open because of a reduction in our development plans 
impairment of goodwill we assess the recoverability of goodwill that is related to our purchase of vinny t s of boston on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we test impairment at the concept level for this goodwill based upon the historical cash flow and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
a concept is deemed to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the concept is less than its carrying amount of fixed assets and goodwill 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the concept exceeds its fair value 
fair value is an estimate based on the best information available including estimated future cash flows  expected growth rates of comparable restaurant sales  remaining lease terms  fair value of other similar restaurant concepts and other factors 
we have not taken an 
table of contents impairment of goodwill related to our purchase of vinny t s of boston 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to take an asset impairment charge related to our goodwill 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our current medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance programs 
in estimating our self insurance reserves  we utilize estimates of future losses  based upon our historical loss trends and historical industry data 
these reserves are monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a change in claims occur compared to what was estimated  our reserves could be either increased or decreased based upon that data 
any increases or decreases in insurance reserves would be offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in insurance expense 
purchase accounting we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on management s best judgments or estimates  with the assistance of third party valuations when necessary 
our financial position and results from operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 
we recorded our purchase of vinny t s of boston in january based upon the purchase method of accounting 
provision for income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
the estimates include effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income and the work opportunity tax credit  the tax rate in which deferred taxes are recognized  and the likelihood that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the tax returns are filed  and could be subject to different interpretations of the tax laws 
the ultimate amount of income taxes that we pay may be higher or lower than our estimates 
we record a tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we recorded a million tax valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

this statement requires that certain instruments that were previously classified as equity on a company s statement of financial position now be classified as liabilities 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june  we currently have no instruments impacted by the adoption of this statement and therefore the adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

an enterprise is considered the primary beneficiary if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns or both

table of contents inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor  property tax and utility costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving line of credit that bears interest at the lower of our lender s reference rate plus to or eurodollar rate plus to to as of march  
as of march   we had million outstanding in debt borrowings under our credit facility 
thus  a change in interest rates would cause annual interest expense to increase by we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control 
to control this risk in part  we have fixed price purchase commitments for food and supplies from vendors who supply our national food distributor 
in addition  we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks 
we believe we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  if needed  in response to a food product price increase 
to compensate for a hypothetical price increase of for food and beverages  we would need to increase menu prices by an average of  which is only slightly more than our average price increases of approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal accordingly  we believe that a hypothetical increase in food product costs would not have a material effect on our operating results
