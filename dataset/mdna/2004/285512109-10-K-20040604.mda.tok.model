item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results as well as the trends and drivers of our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for fiscal  as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in business  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  risk factors or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on home videogame machines such as the sony playstation  microsoft xbox and nintendo gamecube tm consoles  personal computers  hand held game machines such as the game boy advance and online  over the internet and other proprietary online networks 
many of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  madden nfl football  harry potter tm and fifa soccer  and many of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property eg  the sims tm  medal of honor tm 
our goal is to develop titles which appeal to the mass markets and  as a result  we develop  market  publish and distribute our games in over countries  often translating and localizing them for sale in non english speaking countries 
our goal is to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property 
examples of this are the annual iterations of our sports based franchises eg  ncaa football and fifa soccer  titles based on long lived movie properties eg  james bond tm and harry potter and wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg  the sims and medal of honor 
overview of fiscal financial results net revenue for fiscal was  million  up percent as compared with  million for fiscal we had platinum titles over one million units sold in fiscal as compared to platinum titles in in fiscal  six franchises sold more than five million units the sims  need for speed tm  medal of honor  fifa soccer  the lord of the rings tm and madden nfl football 
net income for fiscal was million  an percent increase over fiscal diluted earnings per share increased percent to as compared with for fiscal the growth in earnings was primarily driven by higher sales volume and increased gross margin 
operating cash flow was million as compared with million for fiscal the decline was primarily a result of the timing of sales during the fourth quarter 
management s overview of historical and prospective business trends sales of hit titles 
during fiscal  sales of a number of hit titles contributed to our revenue growth  several of which were top sellers across a number of international markets 
our top five selling titles across all platforms worldwide in fiscal were need for speed tm underground  madden nfl  the lord of the rings tm  the return of the king tm  medal of honor tm rising sun and fifa soccer hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale 
we have developed  and it is our objective to continue to develop  many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated 
increased console installed base 
as consumers purchase the current generation of consoles  either as first time buyers or by upgrading from a previous generation  the console installed base increases 
as the installed base for a particular console increases  we are generally able to increase our unit volume  however  as consumers anticipate the next generation of consoles  unit volumes often decrease 
in the us and europe  
table of contents we believe the installed base for the current generation of consoles playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube increased over percent  percent and percent  respectively  during fiscal accordingly  we believe the significant increase in the installed base for these consoles was a contributing factor to our net revenue growth in fiscal in march  microsoft reduced the retail price of its xbox consoles in the us and in may sony did the same with its playstation consoles 
as price reductions drive sales of consoles and the related installed base of these current generation consoles increases during fiscal  we expect unit sales of current generation titles to remain strong 
software prices 
as current generation console prices decrease  we expect more value oriented consumers to become part of the interactive entertainment software market 
we experienced this trend several years ago when prices were reduced on previous generation consoles eg  sony playstation and nintendo 
we believe that hit titles will continue to be launched at premium price points and will maintain those premium price points longer than less popular games  however  as a result of a more value oriented consumer base  and a greater number of software titles being published  we expect average software prices to gradually come down  which we expect to negatively impact our gross margin 
international sales growth 
our fiscal net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide net revenue  up from percent in fiscal our fiscal increase in international net revenue was driven primarily by increased sales in europe 
in fiscal  we anticipate that international net revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of our worldwide net revenue  although not at the same rate as in fiscal  as we strengthen our presence in new territories and as the console installed base expands more rapidly outside of north america 
foreign exchange impact 
given that a significant portion of our business is conducted internationally in foreign currency  fluctuations in currency prices can have a material impact on our results of operations 
for example  the average exchange rate for one euro  as compared to the us dollar  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal we estimate that we had a total foreign exchange benefit on net revenue of approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal although we intend to continue to utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to either mitigate or hedge against some foreign currency exposures  we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us in fiscal increasing cost of titles 
hit titles have become increasingly more expensive to produce and market as the platforms on which they are played continue to advance technologically and consumers demand continual improvements in the overall gameplay experience 
we expect this trend to continue as we require larger production teams to create our titles  the technology needed to develop titles becomes more complex  we continue to develop and expand the online gaming capabilities included in our products and we develop new methods to distribute our content via the internet 
any increase in the cost of licensing third party intellectual property used in our products would also make these products more expensive to publish 
expansion of studio resources and technology 
during fiscal  as part of our effort to more efficiently utilize our resources and technology  we expanded our studio facilities in los angeles and vancouver  allowing us to consolidate several smaller studios and resources 
in fiscal  we expect to devote significant resources primarily to the expansion of our studios in north america and europe 
as we move through the life cycle of current generation consoles  we will devote increased resources to developing current generation titles  and increase spending associated with tools and technologies for the next generation of consoles 
we expect to develop more titles internally as a result of our studio expansions 
we expect these activities to increase our research and development expenses and decrease our third party development costs  both as a percentage of net revenue 
in addition  we expect the decrease in third party development costs to positively impact our gross margin 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and 
table of contents liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves we principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame platforms such as the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube  pcs and hand held game machines such as the nintendo game boy advance 
product revenue is recognized net of sales allowances 
we also have stock balancing programs for our pc products  which allow for the exchange of pc products by resellers under certain circumstances 
we may decide to provide price protection for both our personal computer and videogame system products 
in making this determination  we evaluate inventory remaining in the channel  the rate of inventory sell through in the channel  and our remaining inventory on hand 
it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits  rather than give cash refunds 
we estimate potential future product returns  price protection and stock balancing programs related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the videogame market and the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances 
in addition  management monitors and manages the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or substantial price protection requirements in subsequent periods 
in the past  actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of product returns for our products may increase as the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates changed  our returns reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our actual results would decrease our reported net revenue 
conversely  if actual returns were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported net revenue 
similarly  significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 
we cannot predict customer bankruptcies or an inability of any of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us 
therefore  our estimates could differ materially from actual results 
royalties licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to co publishing and or distribution affiliates  content licensors  and independent software developers 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for delivery of product 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademark  copyright  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 

table of contents royalty based payments made to content licensors and distribution affiliates that are paid in advance are generally capitalized as prepaid royalties and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
with regard to payments made to independent software developers and co publishing affiliates  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of the product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
each quarter  we also evaluate the future realization of any prepaid royalties as well as minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold 
in either case  we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties 
if actual revenue  or revised sales estimates  fall below the initial sales estimate  then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated 
as of march  we had million of prepaid royalty assets and approximately million in future obligations to our co publishing and or distribution affiliates and content licensors that could be impaired if our sales estimates changed 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists 
this evaluation requires us to estimate  among other things  the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business 
these evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment 
our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 
under current accounting standards  we make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred  management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows 
our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary videogame consoles  hand held game machines and pcs platforms 
the success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
due to product sales shortfalls  we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets  which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future 
we recorded million of impairment charges on long lived assets during fiscal  million during fiscal and million in fiscal income taxes in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these estimates involve complex issues  require extended periods of time to resolve  and require us to make judgments  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns 
we are also required to make the determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in our business  including the geographic mix of income  as well as changes in valuation allowances  the applicable accounting rules  the applicable tax laws and regulations and interpretations 
table of contents thereof  developments in tax audit matters  and estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we resolved certain tax related matters with the internal revenue service  which lowered our income tax expense by million and resulted in a percent rate reduction 
results of operations our fiscal year is reported on a week period that ends on the final saturday of march in each year 
the results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and each contain weeks and ended on march   march  and march   respectively 
for simplicity of presentation  all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end 
on october   our board of directors authorized a two for one stock split of our class a common stock which was distributed on november  in the form of a stock dividend for shareholders of record at the close of business on november  all issued and outstanding share and per share amounts related to the class a common stock have been restated to reflect the stock split for all periods presented 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net revenue we principally derive net revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame consoles such as the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube  pcs and hand held game machines such as the nintendo game boy advance 
additionally  in europe and asia we generate a significant portion of net revenue by marketing and selling third party interactive software games through our established distribution network 
we also derive net revenue from selling subscriptions to online games  programming third party web sites  allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products  and selling advertisements on our online web pages 
from a geographical perspective  our net revenue for the fiscal years ended march  and was as follows in thousands year ended march  increase decrease change north america europe asia pacific japan international consolidated net revenue north america for fiscal  net revenue in north america increased by percent as compared to fiscal from a franchise perspective  the net revenue increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products released during the year ended march  in the following eight franchises need for speed tm  nba street  nfl street  madden nfl  def jam tm  ssx  tiger woods pga tour and mvp baseball tm 
increased sales in these franchises resulted in increased net revenue of million for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  increases in net revenue from these franchises were partially offset by a decrease in our harry potter franchise  as the fiscal title  harry potter tm quidditch tm world cup  had no associated movie release  while our fiscal product  harry potter and the chamber of secrets tm  was released in conjunction with the blockbuster movie of the same title  the termination of our square ea joint venture agreement  and a decrease in net revenue in our

increased sales in these franchises resulted in an increase in net revenue of million for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in our harry potter franchise  as the fiscal title  harry potter quidditch world cup  had no associated movie release  while our fiscal product  harry potter and the chamber of secrets  was released in conjunction with the blockbuster movie of the same title  and an expected decrease in sales of our world cup franchise due to strong sales in the year ended march  in conjunction with the world cup event and no similar event in the year ended march  together  the two items noted above  reduced net revenue by million for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  asia pacific for fiscal  net revenue from sales in the asia pacific region  excluding japan  increased by percent as compared to fiscal the growth in net revenue was driven by the need for speed  the sims and other franchises  partially offset by declines in the harry potter and world cup franchises 
we estimate foreign exchange rates strengthened reported asia pacific net revenue by approximately million or percent  for the year ended march  excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates  we estimate that asia pacific net revenue decreased by approximately million or percent  for the year ended march  japan for fiscal  net revenue from sales in japan decreased by percent as compared to fiscal primarily due to declines in sales in the world cup  harry potter and final fantasy franchises 
in addition  we estimate that favorable changes in foreign exchange rates offset the decline in reported net revenue in japan by approximately million or percent  for the year ended march

pc net revenue from pc based products decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total net revenue  sales of pc products decreased by percent in fiscal pc net revenue declined  largely due to declines of sales in the harry potter  world cup and bond franchises as discussed above  which were partially offset by an increase in sales of the lord of the rings franchise 
xbox net revenue from xbox products increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total net revenue  sales of xbox products increased by percent in fiscal the increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products 
nintendo gamecube net revenue from nintendo gamecube products increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base of the nintendo gamecube 
subscription services in fiscal  net revenue from subscription services products increased by million to million as compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue was primarily due to the number of users for club pogo launched in july and pogo downloadables launched in may  partially offset by a decrease in 
table of contents subscription net revenue from the sims tm online  ultima online tm  and earth beyond tm subscription services 
playstation in fiscal  net revenue from playstation products decreased by million to million as compared to fiscal we anticipated the decline in net revenue from playstation products as we continued to transition away from that platform 
although our playstation products are playable on the playstation console  we expect sales of current playstation products to continue to decline in the future 
co publishing and distribution in fiscal  net revenue from co publishing and distribution products increased by million to million as compared to fiscal the increase was due to a million increase in europe primarily from increased sales in the final fantasy  freedom fighters and battlefield franchises  partially offset by a decline in the kingdom hearts franchise in north america 
although co publishing and distribution net revenue increased  it declined as a percentage of net revenue 
advertising  programming  licensing and other in fiscal  net revenue from advertising  programming  licensing and other products decreased by million to million as compared to fiscal the decrease was a result of expected declines in our advertising and programming net revenue following our renegotiation of the terms of our relationship with aol during the three months ended june  and an expected decline in our game boy color net revenue as we transitioned away from that platform 
operations by segment in march  we consolidated the operations of the ea 
com business segment into our core business 
we now consider online capability and gameplay to be integral to our existing and future products 
accordingly  beginning april   we no longer manage our online products and services as a separate business segment  and we have consolidated the reporting related to our online products and services into reporting for the overall development and publication of our core products for all reporting periods ending after that date 
we believe that this will better reflect the way in which our chief executive officer our chief operating decision maker reviews and manages our business and reflects the importance of our online products and services relative to the rest of our business 
concurrently  we have also eliminated separate reporting for our class b common stock for all reporting periods ending after april  fiscal and have been restated to conform with our fiscal presentation

table of contents costs of goods sold for fiscal years and in thousands march  of net march  of net revenue revenue change in fiscal  cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue decreased by percentage points to percent from percent for fiscal primarily due to a percent decrease in product costs and a percent decrease in royalty rates 
the percent decrease in product costs was primarily a result of n lower co publishing and distribution product costs  as a percentage of net revenue  due to a higher mix of co publishing titles relative to distribution titles in fiscal co publishing titles generally have higher gross margins than distribution titles 
lower co publishing and distribution costs  as a percentage of net revenue  increased total gross margin by percent in fiscal n lower average manufacturing costs increased total gross margin by percent in fiscal n lower period costs primarily due to improved inventory management in north america 
lower period costs increased total gross margin by percent in fiscal the percent decrease in royalty rates was primarily the result of n decreased third party development royalties primarily due to a higher mix of titles developed internally rather than externally in fiscal significant titles that were developed internally in fiscal for which a comparable title had been developed externally in fiscal included james bond everything or nothing and the lord of the rings  the return of the king 
we estimate that lower development royalties increased gross margin by percent  which was spread across multiple platforms

income taxes income taxes for fiscal years and in thousands march  effective march  effective tax rate tax rate change 
table of contents our effective income tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of percent 
the effective income tax rate was percent for fiscal and percent for fiscal the reduced effective income tax rate in fiscal primarily reflects the resolution of certain tax related matters with the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which lowered our income tax expense by million and resulted in a percent rate reduction and a change in the geographic mix of taxable income subject to lower tax rates 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings outside the us and  accordingly  have not provided us taxes that would be incurred if such earnings were repatriated back to the us undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at march  we are currently projecting an effective income tax rate of approximately percent for fiscal an effective income tax rate projection  which is inherently uncertain  is based on current tax law and current projections of the mix of income in various taxing jurisdictions and assumes no material changes in our business or the applicable tax or accounting rules 
our actual effective income tax rates for fiscal and future periods can differ from the projected effective income tax rates due to a variety of factors  including changes in our business that were not taken into account in connection with our projection  a variation between the projected and actual mix of income between international and domestic operations  changes or interpretations to applicable tax laws and regulations  changes in the applicable accounting rules or our ability to realize deferred tax assets  or developments in tax audit matters with various tax authorities 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we resolved certain tax related matters with the internal revenue service  which lowered our income tax expense by million and resulted in a percent rate reduction 
finally  our projected effective income tax rate for fiscal does not take into account a new election that is available under the us income tax rules regarding the allocation between us and foreign jurisdictions tax deductions attributable to employee stock option compensation 
if we take advantage of this election  it could detrimentally affect our effective income tax rate 
we have not yet determined the impact that the election would have on our reported results

table of contents risk factors our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties  which may affect our future financial performance 
the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 
if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs  our business and financial performance could be harmed  our actual results could differ materially from our expectations  and the market value of our securities could decline 
the success of our business is highly dependent on being able to predict which new videogame platforms will be successful  and on the market acceptance and timely release of those platforms 
we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on videogame platforms manufactured by third parties  such as sony s playstation therefore  the success of our products is driven in large part by the success of new videogame hardware systems and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace 
we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform 
a new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed  may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated 
if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance  our revenue growth will suffer  we may be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed  and our financial performance will be harmed 
our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms  and therefore have significant influence on our costs 
if one or more of the platform licensors adopt a different fee structure for future game consoles or we are unable to obtain such licenses  our profitability will be materially impacted 
in the next few years  we expect our platform licensors to introduce new game machines into the market 
in order to publish products for a new game machine  we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform 
similarly  the platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles 
the control that platform licensors have over the fee structures for their future platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term 
it is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our licenses 
because publishing products for videogame consoles is the largest portion of our business  any increase in fee structures or failure to secure a license relationship would have a significant negative impact on our business model and profitability 
our business is both seasonal and cyclical 
if we fail to deliver our products at the right times  our sales will suffer 
our business is highly seasonal  with the highest levels of consumer demand  and a significant percentage of our revenue  occurring in the december quarter 
if we miss this key selling period  due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products  our sales will suffer disproportionately 
our industry is also cyclical 
videogame platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years 
as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging  consumers often defer game software purchases until the new platforms are available  causing sales to decline 
this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platform 
for example  following the launch of sony s playstation platform  we experienced a significant decline in revenue from sales of products for sony s older playstation game console  which was not immediately offset by revenue generated from sales of products for the playstation platform 

table of contents our business is intensely competitive and increasingly hit driven 
if we do not continue to deliver hit products  our success will be limited 
competition in our industry is intense  and new products are regularly introduced 
a relatively small number of hit titles accounts for a significant portion of total sales 
for example  during calendar year  approximately percent of the sales of videogames in north america consisted of only hit products 
if our competitors develop more successful products  or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality products  our revenue and profitability will decline 
if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property  we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue  profitability and cash flows will decline 
competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 
many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others 
for example  our ea sports products include rights licensed from the major sports leagues and players associations 
similarly  many of our hit ea games franchises  such as bond  harry potter and lord of the rings  are based on key film and literary licenses 
competition for these licenses is intense 
if we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value  our revenues and profitability will decline significantly 
competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances  guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor  which could significantly increase our costs 
if patent claims continue to be asserted against us  we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits 
many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies 
additionally  infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games 
several such claims have been asserted against us 
such claims can harm our business 
we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future 
other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products 
many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images  and we expect that as technology continues to advance  images will become even more realistic 
some of the images and other content are based on real world examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others  it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement 
from time to time  we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims 
existing or future infringement claims against us  whether valid or not  may be time consuming and expensive to defend 
such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products  redesign those products to avoid infringement  or obtain a license  all of which would be costly and harm our business 
our business  our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories of content  consumer privacy and online delivery 
if we do not successfully respond to these regulations  our business may suffer 
legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution 
for example  privacy laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites 
those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries 
other countries  such as germany  have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws 
in the united states  the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours  as well as restrictions on distribution of such products 
any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between 
table of contents products for different territories to address varying regulations 
this additional product differentiation would be costly 
if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules  we will experience fluctuations in our operating results 
our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors  including the creative processes involved  the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products  and the need to refine and tune our products prior to their release 
we have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products 
failure to meet anticipated production or go live schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations 
delays that prevent release of our products during peak selling seasons or in conjunction with specific events  such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event  could adversely affect our financial performance 
technology changes rapidly in our business  and if we fail to anticipate new technologies  the quality  timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer 
rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate  sometimes years in advance  which technologies our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released 
therefore  we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve 
we may not be able to achieve these goals  or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can 
in either case  our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products  or less appealing to consumers  or both 
if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products  then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved  which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses 
alternatively  we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies  either to preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our competition  which would increase our development expenses 
if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel  we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 
the market for technical  creative  marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive 
our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need  or replace key employees following their departure  our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 
our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and or access to our videogame products 
if they do not approve our products  we will be unable to ship to our customers 
our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation  microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the nintendo gamecube typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products  which could  in certain circumstances  leave us unable to get our products approved  manufactured and shipped to customers 
these hardware licensors are also our chief competitors 
in most events  control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently 
while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good  the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists 
such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

table of contents we compete directly with microsoft and sony for sales of products with online capabilities 
we also require compatibility code and the consent of each in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms 
as online capabilities for videogame platforms become more significant  microsoft and sony could restrict our ability to provide online capabilities for our console platform products 
if microsoft or sony refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers  our business could be harmed 
our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations 
for the year ended march   international net revenue comprised percent of total net revenue 
for the fiscal year ended march   international net revenue comprised percent of total consolidated net revenue 
we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenue 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies  which may fluctuate against the dollar 
while we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables  and foreign currency option contracts to hedge some foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to revenue generated by our operational subsidiaries  our results of operations and financial condition may  nonetheless  be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our reported financial results could be affected if significant changes in current accounting principles are adopted 
recent actions and public comments from the sec have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
similarly  congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles 
the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards  such as accounting for stock options  some of which represent a significant change from current practices 
for example  changes in our accounting for stock options could materially increase our reported expenses 
our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
as a result of the factors discussed in this report  general economic conditions  and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of our common stock historically has been  and we expect will continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  to factors affecting the computer  software  internet  entertainment  media or electronics businesses  or to national and international economic conditions 
the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers 
if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them  our business could be harmed 
in the us in fiscal  over percent of our sales were made to six key customers 
in europe  our top ten customers accounted for over percent of our sales in that territory in fiscal worldwide  we had direct sales to one customer  wal mart stores  inc  which represented percent of total net revenue in fiscal though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers  the concentration of our sales in one  or a few  large customers could lead to short term disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products  and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products 
additionally  our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season 
also  having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers 

table of contents acquisitions  investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties  dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including acquisitions of companies  businesses  intellectual properties  and other assets  and investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example  online and mobile games 
any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions  we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities 
we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings 
in addition  the process of integrating an acquired company or business  or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets  could divert a significant amount of our management s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
additional risks we face include n the need to implement or remediate controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls  procedures and policies  n cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization  n retaining employees from the businesses we acquire  n the need to integrate an acquired company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and n to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the united states  we face additional risks  including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risks and the particular economic  political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 
future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities  potentially diluting our existing stockholders  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses  or write offs of goodwill  any of which could harm our financial condition 
our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review  vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 
we have begun the implementation of a common set of financial information systems throughout our worldwide organization  which  if not completed in a successful and timely manner  could impede our ability to accurately process  prepare and analyze important financial data 
as part of our effort to improve efficiencies throughout our worldwide organization  we have begun the implementation of a common set of practices  processes and financial information systems 
the successful conversion from our current financial information systems to new financial information systems entails a number of risks due to the complexity of the conversion and implementation process 
such risks include verifying the accuracy of the business data and information prior to conversion  the actual conversion of that data and information to the new systems and then using that business data and information in the new systems after the conversion 
in addition  because the implementation is company wide  there is a need for substantial and comprehensive company wide employee training 
while testing of these new systems and processes and training of employees are done in advance of implementation  there are inherent limitations in our ability to simulate a full scale operating environment in advance of implementation 
finally  there can be no assurance that the conversion to  and the implementation of  the new financial information systems will not impede our ability to accurately and timely process  prepare and analyze the financial data we use in making operating decisions and which form the basis of the financial information we include in the periodic reports we file with the sec 

table of contents our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a variety of organizations and individuals 
if we are not successful in combating and preventing piracy  our sales and profitability could be harmed significantly 
in many countries around the world  more pirated copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies 
though piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to date  highly organized pirate operations have been expanding globally 
in addition  the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products  the availability of broadband access to the internet  the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various internet sites  and the widespread proliferation of internet cafes using pirated copies of our products  all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy 
though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult  as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played  neither our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be successful in controlling the piracy of our products 
this could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts used to either mitigate or hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from changes in the forward rate are recognized in earnings and are designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
as of march   we had foreign exchange forward contracts  all with maturities of less than one month  to sell approximately million in foreign currencies  consisting primarily of british pounds  euros  japanese yen and other currencies 
of this amount  million represents contracts to sell foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and million represents contracts to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pounds 
from time to time  we hedge some of our foreign currency risk related to anticipated future sales transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
if qualified  these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges 
for the year ended march   we recognized a loss of million in earnings associated with the time value of these option contracts 
the counterparties to these forward and options contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks  there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

table of contents the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of march  the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward or option amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
the fair value of our forward and option contracts is recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
weighted notional average amount contract rate fair value in thousands  except contract rates foreign currency to be sold under contract british pound euro japanese yen swedish krona danish krone australian dollar norwegian krone swiss franc south african rand total foreign currency to be purchased under contract british pound option contracts purchased euro 
table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
though we maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity  currently  the majority of our investments are callable by the issuer 
as there can be no assurance as to how long these investments will be held  we classify these securities as short term investments based on call date 
as of march   our cash equivalents and short term investments included billion of debt securities  consisting primarily of us agency bonds  money market funds and municipal securities 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the table below presents the amounts in thousands and related weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio as of march  weighted average interest rate cost fair value cash equivalents fixed rate variable rate short term investments fixed rate variable rate see definition in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item hereof 
maturity dates for short term investments range from months to months with call dates ranging from months to months
