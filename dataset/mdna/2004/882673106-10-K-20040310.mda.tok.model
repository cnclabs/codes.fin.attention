management continually refines the company s credit policies and procedures to address the risks in the current and prospective environment and to reflect management s current strategic focus 
the credit process is controlled with continuous credit review and analysis  and review by internal and external auditors and regulatory authorities

approvals for the extension or renewal of loans without reduction of principal for more than one twelve month period are generally avoided  unless the loans are fully secured and properly margined by cash or marketable securities  or are revolving lines subject to annual analysis and renewal 
nonperforming assets the company has several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the bank has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
nonperforming assets consist of loans and other assets  primarily real estate  acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations 
nonperforming loans include loans on nonaccrual status or that have been restructured 
the company s policy generally is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when payment of principal or interest is contractually past due days  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal and interest 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but uncollected is reversed and charged against current income unless the collateral provides more than adequate margin to ensure collection of that interest 
a restructured loan is generally a loan that is accruing interest  but on which concessions in terms have been made as a result of deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
the company s classification of nonperforming loans includes those loans for which management believes collection is doubtful 
management is not aware of any specific borrower relationships that are not reported as nonperforming where management has doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which would cause nonperforming assets to increase materially 
nonperforming assets of  at december  decreased  or compared to december  levels of  nonperforming assets decreased as a percentage of total assets from at december  to at december  during  nonperforming assets increased  or compared with december  levels of  nonaccrual loans of  at december  decreased  or compared to december  levels of  the decrease resulted primarily from one loan relationship in which  was either charged off or transferred to foreclosed assets

foreclosed and other assets of  at december  remained comparable to december  levels of  decreasing by only  or 
management actively seeks buyers for all other real estate 
see noninterest expense below 
loans which are contractually past due days or more  which are both well secured or guaranteed by financially responsible third parties and in the process of collection  generally are not placed on nonaccrual status 
the amount of such loans past due days or more at december   and that are not classified as nonaccrual totaled   and  respectively 
the increase in accruing loans past due days or more at december  compared to december  was primarily a result of the addition of five relationships totaling  the increase was partially offset by one relationship totaling  transferred to other real estate during the ratio of nonperforming assets plus accruing loans days or more past due as a percent of loans held for investment and foreclosed and other assets at december  decreased to from at december  primarily as a result of the increase in loans held for investment

management believes that  at december   all such loans had been identified and included in the nonaccrual  renegotiated or days or more past due loan totals reflected in the table above 
management continues to emphasize maintaining a low level of nonperforming assets and returning nonperforming assets to an earning status 
allowance for loan losses critical accounting policy management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision required to maintain an adequate allowance 
estimating the allowance is a critical accounting policy 
it is subjective in nature and requires material estimates that may be subject to revision as facts and circumstances warrant 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management reviews the size  quality and risks of loans in the portfolio and considers factors such as specific known risks  past experience  the status and amount of nonperforming assets and economic conditions 
a specific percentage is allocated to total loans held for investment in good standing and not specifically reserved while additional amounts are added for individual loans considered to have specific loss potential 
loans identified as losses are charged off 
in addition  the loan review committee of the bank reviews the assessments of management in determining the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
based on total allocations  the provision is recorded to maintain the allowance at a level deemed appropriate by management based on probable losses in the loan portfolio 
there can be no assurance that future additions or reductions to the allowance will not be necessary 
the allowance for loan losses at december  totaled  representing a net increase of  or compared to  at december  the increase in the allowance for loan loss is comparable with the growth in the loans held for investment portfolio of 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  adequately reflects the probable losses in the loan portfolio 
state and federal bank regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination

liquidity management assures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  loan demand and maturing liabilities 
insufficient liquidity can result in higher costs of obtaining funds  while excessive liquidity can lead to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative investments

effects of inflation financial institutions are impacted differently by inflation than are industrial companies 
while industrial and manufacturing companies generally have significant investments in inventories and fixed assets  financial institutions ordinarily do not have such investments 
as a result  financial institutions are generally in a better position than industrial companies to respond to inflationary trends by monitoring the spread between interest costs and interest income yields through adjustments of maturities and interest rates of assets and liabilities 
in addition  inflation tends to increase demand for loans from financial institutions as industrial companies attempt to maintain a constant level of goods in inventory and assets 
as consumers of goods and services  financial institutions are affected by inflation as prices increase  causing an increase in costs of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense and similar items

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
for example  if fixed rate loans are funded with floating rate deposits  the spread between loan and deposit rates will decline or turn negative if rates increase 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the company s interest rate risk arises from transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is managed within the funds management policy of the company 
the principal objectives of the funds management policy are to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to maintain consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the board of directors oversees implementation of strategies to control interest rate risk 
the company may take steps to alter its net sensitivity position by offering deposit and or loan structures that tend to counter the natural rate risk profile of the company 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed 
because of the volatility of market rates and uncertainties  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of management programs to achieve a targeted moderation of risk 
in order to measure earnings and fair value sensitivity to changing rates  the company utilizes three different measurement tools including static gap analysis  simulation earnings  and market value sensitivity fair value at risk 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to quantify interest rate risk is a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis estimates a percentage of change in net interest income from the stable rate scenario under scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates over a twelve month time horizon 
the prime rate serves as a driver and is made to rise or fall evenly in basis point increments over the month forecast interval 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income over a month period as of december  and december  changes in interest estimated net increase decrease in net interest income rates basis points interest income amount percent dollars in thousands december  december  all the measurements of risk described above are made based upon the company s business mix and interest rate exposures at the particular point in time 
an immediate basis point decline in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario  used to calibrate risk  and does not necessarily represent management s current view of future market developments 
because of uncertainties as to the extent of customer behavior  refinance activity  absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor pricing and market behavior  product volumes and mix  and other unexpected changes in economic events impacting movements and volatility in market rates  there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of net interest income under such conditions 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the dollar amount of difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities within a given time period gap 
a gap ratio is determined by dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
a ratio of indicates a perfectly matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements would be zero 
the following table summarizes interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities by their repricing dates at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis months months months years over years total dollars in thousands loans held for investment loans held for sale securities available for sale held to maturity interest bearing and time deposits total interest bearing assets savings money market checking and savings accounts time deposits other borrowed money total interest bearing liabilities rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap ratio of cumulative rate sensitivity gap to total assets ratio of cumulative rate sensitive interest earning assets to cumulative rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive interest earning assets less rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities
