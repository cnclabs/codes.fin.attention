the company plans to grow by offering combined website design  website hosting  and servicing and marketing related products and consultation to small and medium sized business owners 
the targeted market is sometimes referred to as the mass market or mainstream market strategy to distinguish it from the market for traditional technical hosting 
the company s strategy is based on the assumption that its targeted market is in greater need of expertise and value added solutions and is therefore more likely to pay for higher margin services and less likely to switch providers

corporate strategy interland is a leader in making the power of the internet available to smes 
in addition to providing traditional web hosting and electronic commerce services to those who desire mere presence on the world wide web  interland offers products and services designed to permit an sme to utilize a website as an alternative communication channel with its clients and potential clients 
the company s offerings make it possible and efficient for smes to find leads  make sales  and to service their clients online 
interland offers to provide website marketing  design and management  as well as management of hosted application services through both its shared and dedicated lines of business 
the shared line of business provides services to customers whose needs are compatible with being hosted on a server that hosts hundreds of other similar customers  the dedicated line of business serves customers who require a server or servers exclusively devoted to their needs 
interland periodically assesses the value of both existing and contemplated service offerings to customers through extensive marketing research directed to its existing customers  with special focus on customers who appear to be successful in using online resources 
interland s products are sold directly and through distribution partners  for both shared and dedicated hosting business lines 
interland assembles  bundles and tailors its products to meet the requirements of the distribution partners targeted markets  taking into account the respective mechanisms of distribution and branding 
interland provides applications on linux and microsoft windows platforms  which may be used while the customer is an interland hosting customer 
among these services are website marketing services  website creation and management services  electronic commerce services  email services  and hosting services 
in the dedicated line of business interland provides applications on dedicated servers  as well as network and hardware reliability and security products  marketing services  and bundles supporting outsourcing of specific web based applications 
the lack of technical sophistication of many smes  coupled with the relatively high cost of maintaining dedicated servers in house makes interland s dedicated offerings attractive to this market 
larger enterprises use interland s dedicated services to develop and host specific activities  often those that are specialized or developmental in nature 
a smaller portion of interland s dedicated business serves larger enterprises that require managed services provided through multiple servers 
interland has acquired and developed proprietary software for the efficient integration  packaging and support of new technologies and services into its basic hosting products 
the software or technology may be developed by the company  acquired  or licensed from third parties 
the company s web design products are largely derived from  or influenced by software and related technology obtained through the acquisition of trellix corporation in early these tools can be configured to enable only modestly trained sme business personnel to design a website with great functionality in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost charged by website development firms 
the tools can also be configured to provide additional functionality designed to be used by professional web designers who can thereby gain high productivity  enabling the company to provide professional quality websites at modest cost 
the company s growing experience in designing websites for a large number of types of businesses further contributes to efficiency 
using the website development tools as a base  the company is continuing to develop a broad range of products and services  collectively known as business solutions  designed to help mainstream businesses attract and serve customers through websites supplied by interland designers using its proprietary design software 
during  the company tested and 
table of contents marketed products based on the use of these software tools 
based on initial results  the company  in several stages  increased the number of direct salespeople  web designers and support personnel dedicated to this effort in order to further test the ability of the distribution and provisioning models to perform profitably at increasingly larger scales 
at the end of february  however  management concluded that despite the fact that many of the assumptions underlying the business plan were being proven  certain aspects of the business were not performing to the standard required to justify continued high levels of investment 
accordingly  in early march the company announced that it would substantially reduce its investment level and concentrate the website and software development teams in atlanta for greater interaction with the rest of the company 
at the same time  the company recognized that the costs of acquiring customers through a directly employed sales force would substantially retard market penetration and accordingly shifted its customer acquisition efforts to an indirect sales model 
interland s distribution partners enable it to acquire new customers at a lower cost relative to revenue than would be possible through direct marketing and sales 
interland s distribution partners now include telecommunications companies  yellow pages publishers  credit card companies  as well as local resellers  which also often provide other technology services to their clients 
interland intends to expand and grow its relationships with these partners 
products and services interland offers a number of products across its channels of distribution in both its shared and dedicated lines of business 
the company defines products as applications discrete software code provided to the customer  services software and hardware bundled together and used by the customer on a shared basis  and managed services company personnel operate and support a particular application or service on behalf of the customer 
other than for the former customers of hostcentric  all of interland s products are provisioned and billed by a central operational support system oss enabling centralized plan management 
interland offers dedicated servers on either windows or linux operating systems together with the relevant applications to support secure and reliable application hosting 
the company also employs shared servers running either linux or windows operating systems as the technology platform to offer an integrated suite of website design  online marketing  and ecommerce applications 
both product lines are designed to address the needs of small and medium sized businesses 
most of the company s revenues are generated from recurring monthly fees 
the remainder is derived from one time setup fees for website creation  product installation  domain names and other related one time fees 
the company generally sells its services under month to month agreements  but also offers longer term contracts 
customers most often pay for the services monthly by credit card or by automatic draft of checking accounts 
shared hosting service shared hosting services are delivered either in a network attached storage or in a server based storage configuration 
the former is marketed as bluehalo  and provides a shared external ip address and name based domains internally 
product packages range from entry level starter packages to business e commerce shared web hosting products 
interland s shared hosting packages lower the capital asset component of the company s costs by placing numerous customers on a single shared server  and provide a lower price to the customer 
starter packages are designed for websites with relatively low volumes of traffic and provide a web presence at minimal cost 
the company s products are designed so that a customer who purchases an entry level plan can easily upgrade to more full featured services 
interland s services feature easy to use control panels and extensive on line documentation that allow customers to easily control their own applications 
the majority of the company s customers use its shared hosting services 
website promotion services many smes require assistance in promoting their website and interland offers a broad range of online marketing and promotions services  including managed pay per click advertising  search engine optimization  google adwords credits  and internet marketing submission services  which are designed to draw potential customers to the sme s website 
website design and content management services following its acquisition of trellix  interland introduced website development services  both in the form of a suite of software tools configured for use by end users  and in the form of consultation and design development services 
the company believes that the primary barriers to adoption of online solutions by smes have been a lack of technical expertise and the perceived high cost and often unsatisfactory experience associated with engaging a traditional professional website development firm 
the company believes that its business solutions services provide a superior alternative at a cost that smes will regard as affordable and efficient 

table of contents e commerce and other applications hosting services interland s applications hosting services allow customers to outsource the deployment  configuration  hosting  management and support of various software applications 
the company s applications hosting services allow customers to deploy a software application more quickly and with reduced initial costs 
in addition  many small and medium sized businesses do not have the internal technical resources to support multiple software applications 
the company therefore believes that outsourcing these functions is a desirable alternative for these businesses 
the types of applications the company can successfully host for customers include collaboration tools  business tools  mail service tools and e commerce applications 
the company itself hosts applications that consist of website building tools  online storefront  e commerce solutions  and a suite of managed services all of which are designed to help businesses succeed online 
email the company provides email services to all of its shared hosting customers 
dedicated hosting service in contrast to a shared hosting environment  which hosts multiple customers on a single server  dedicated hosting employs one or more servers dedicated to a single customer 
dedicated hosting provides a customer with increased performance  server access  the ability to use custom applications  greater security and higher levels of technical support  and higher volumes of data communications service 
interland provides both managed and unmanaged dedicated services 
for managed dedicated hosting services  the company monitors  administers and troubleshoots the software that operates the client server 
for unmanaged dedicated hosting services  the customer administers the server remotely  with the company providing the hardware monitoring and network and hardware support 
dedicated hosting services are targeted for websites that generally require sophisticated databases for critical application needs or typically experience high user traffic volumes 
the company s managed services are targeted to those who need the complex services required for mission critical websites  but do not want to administer their own server 
the dedicated services include access to a proprietary control panel  which enables customers to setup and maintain websites on the server 
interland offers dedicated web hosting services for major computer platforms  including microsoft nt  windows and linux 
other products and services interland also makes available other complementary products and services including domain name registration and technical consulting 
the company believes these value added products and services enable it to provide its customers the necessary tools to create  host and maintain a successful web presence 
the company believes that the outsourcing of these functions is a desirable and increasingly preferred alternative for smes 
partner specific products interland has a number of product configurations that are only sold through distribution partners and are not marketed under the interland brand directly 
see  key strategic relationships below 
sales and marketing interland s sales and marketing strategy focuses on providing demonstrable benefits to small and medium sized businesses 
the company has identified target market segments and seeks to match that segment s particular needs with a specific subset of the company s offered products  pricing  and selling initiatives 
the company sells products both directly and through a number of distribution partners 
prospects are generated from the current client base and from online and print advertising 
key strategic relationships interland has established  and intends to continue to develop  relationships with leading technology providers  including major software  hardware  development and internet marketing organizations  to enhance the design and sales of its products and services 
these relationships enable the company to quickly gain access to innovative technologies  to provide more creative solutions for its customers  and to allow it to offer customers resources that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive 
the company is also able to build upon the research  development and expertise of these companies in developing and launching new products 
the company believes that these relationships will enable it to continue to provide its customers with the necessary tools to create  host and maintain a successful web presence and to have access to sophisticated e commerce and applications solutions 
included among these relationships are enterprise distribution partners edp 
table of contents enterprise distribution partners sell interland s products under the partner s brand name 
these partners offer a customized mix of the company s software  infrastructure  and support 
financial terms for these customers are typically negotiated based upon the bundles developed and generally provide interland some guaranteed minimum performance 
dex media is a recently named example of an edp partner 
enterprise resellers enterprise resellers sell interland s products jointly under the partner s brand name and interland s brand name 
these partners also offer a customized mix of the company s sales  software  infrastructure  and support  and financial terms are usually based on a fee paid by interland per customer  or on a percentage of the revenues generated 
advanta  a credit card company  is an example of an enterprise reseller 
value added partners value added partners vaps may sell interland s products under the partner s or interland s brand name 
they differ from enterprise resellers in that they most often offer services or products of their own such as website design  or providing and installing personal computers and tend to be smaller and more locally focused 
the company has thousands of such relationships today 
technology marketing partners technology marketing partners provide joint for marketing  which helps interland sell the partner s software or hardware 
these partners also serve as credible references  and provide the company with valuable insights into the direction of the technology being developed by these partners 
microsoft corporation and ibm are among the company s technology marketing partners 
customers as of august   the company had approximately  paid shared hosting customer accounts and it managed nearly  dedicated servers compared to  paid shared hosting customer accounts and nearly  dedicated servers as of august  additionally  the company hosts thousands of more basic websites under plans formerly marketed by trellix through internet portals and other companies  such as cnet 
network infrastructure  technology and operations to provide a secure and reliable hosting environment  interland has constructed a managed infrastructure  consisting of data centers  a redundant internet communications backbone  enterprise management software  and an advanced network 
data centers the company has a total of almost  square feet of data center floor space 
these data centers  located in atlanta  georgia  sq 
ft  miami  florida  sq 
ft 
and fremont  california  sq 
ft  include network operations centers that are managed and monitored hours per day  every day of the year  monitoring of all critical systems  redundant network hardware  parallel redundant backup power generators  fire suppression systems  cooling systems that include independent full grade mechanical systems  security  including security guards and video monitoring and entry restriction via access devices  and multiple tier backbones providing internet connectivity 
proprietary technology interland s various proprietary technologies are designed to allow customers to order  change and manage their web hosting accounts easily regardless of their level of technical expertise 
proprietary technologies also enable the company to automate a number of back end functions and processes 
for example  the company s provisioning system automatically activates customer initiated website changes within minutes of entry 
the company s administration page technology lets customers modify their websites from the internet without having to contact the company s support staff 
this technology provides the company with the opportunity to achieve greater operational efficiencies and allows the customer to change passwords  protect specific directories  and to create database sources without the assistance of the company s technical support staff 
although the company believes that its suite of technology offers its customers significant benefits  the company does not believe that any sustainable material competitive advantage is derived from intellectual property associated with its operation of its data centers 

table of contents network operations centers interland continuously monitors its network operations with technical experts in windows and linux operating platforms 
the network operations center personnel monitor each piece of equipment  including routers  switches and servers  as well as all internet and communication connections 
the network operations centers are designed to allow engineers  administrators  and support staff to continually monitor all systems and to be promptly alerted to any abnormalities 
the company has procedures designed to rapidly resolve technical problems that arise 
international revenues interland s international revenues from continuing operations totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
international revenues are denominated and paid in us dollars and represent revenues from international customers generated and supported in the us the company has no network operations outside of the united states 
competition interland believes that the primary competitive factors in the technical segment of its business are reliability  technical support and price 
although the market is intensely competitive  the company believes that it compares favorably with its competition on these factors 
in the sme mainstream market  the company believes that the critical success factor is the ability to enable businesses owners to use their website to attract potential clients  to make sales  and service their clients 
the pricing in the technical segment is subject to heavy competitive pressure and competitors have even offered such services at a dramatically reduced price  or even for free  as a means of acquiring market share or of fostering market awareness 
the company believes that promotional pricing by competitors will continue for only a limited time  and that the costs of providing reliable service and effective technical and customer support will ultimately be reflected in market prices 
nonetheless  relatively low prices are likely to continue to be available for very basic service  and customers who only require a minimal web presence can be expected to often be lost to competitors whose cost structures and prices are based on providing rudimentary service 
the sme hosting market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors  most of which have market share of less than 
a number of these companies offer web hosting in addition to their core products and services 
current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms that provide a wide array of information technology services  computer hardware suppliers and internet centric companies 
some of the company s most prominent competitors include yahoo  earthlink  ntt verio and affinity internet  inc the company does not consider itself to be in direct competition with companies such as ibm  digex  globix or navisite since these companies generally provide high end services that are highly customized  require the user to have technical expertise  and typically charge several thousand dollars per month 
interland s solutions are standardized  do not require the user to have technical expertise  and generally sell for less than per month 
interland believes that it can sell standardized solutions to a larger customer base on a more efficient and profitable basis than can providers of high end  customized solutions 
intellectual property interland relies on a combination of laws including patent  copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its services 
as of august   the company owned eleven issued us patents and had several additional patent applications pending but not yet issued 
interland has entered into confidentiality and other agreements with its employees and contractors  including agreements in which the employees and contractors assign their rights in inventions to 
interland has also entered into nondisclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and some customers in order to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
nonetheless  neither the intellectual property laws nor contractual arrangements  nor any of the other steps the company has taken to protect its intellectual property can ensure that others will not use its technology  or that others will not develop similar technologies 
interland licenses  or leases from others  many technologies used in its internet application services 
the company expects that it and its customers increasingly will be subject to third party infringement claims as the number of websites and third party service providers for web based businesses grows 
although the company does not believe that its technologies or services infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  the company cannot ensure that third parties will not assert claims against it in the future or that these claims will not be successful 
although it has discontinued operations as a manufacturer of personal computers in the electronics industry  the company is nonetheless subject to litigation arising from its past activities 
it is not uncommon in the electronics industry for patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and personal computer 
table of contents manufacturers 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it has used in these discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in its discontinued operations products or processes  it may be legally liable to the owner of such intellectual property 
moreover  even in those instances where the company is justified in denying claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others  it may nonetheless be forced to defend legal actions taken against the company relating to allegedly protected technology  and such legal actions may require the company to expend substantial funds 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors impairment of interland s intellectual property rights could negatively affect its business or could allow competitors to minimize any advantage that interland s proprietary technology may give it 
government regulation interland is not currently subject to direct federal  state or local government regulation  other than regulations that apply to publicly registered businesses generally 
this could change in the future see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors interland s business operates in an uncertain legal environment where future government regulation and lawsuits could restrict interland s business or cause unexpected losses 
employees the company employed approximately individuals  including contractors as of august  compared to approximately individuals  including contractors as of august  all of the company s employees are located in the united states and none is represented by a labor organization with respect to employment by the company 
as of august   the company has never had an organized work stoppage  and it considers its employee relations to be satisfactory 
environmental regulations some risks of costs and liabilities related to environmental matters have been inherent in the company s discontinued operations  as with many similar businesses  and its operations are subject to certain federal  state and local environmental regulatory requirements relating to environmental and waste management 
in connection with the company s discontinued operations  it periodically generated and handled limited amounts of materials that were considered hazardous waste under applicable law 
the company contracted for the off site disposal of these materials 
the company believes it has operated in compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
the company employs diesel fuel to power some of its backup generators 
this fuel is stored in tanks  which must be monitored to avoid spills and leaks  which could lead to violation of environmental regulations 
the company believes it employs appropriate safeguards to comply with applicable regulations

murphy s two promissory notes one of which was non recourse while the other was recourse 
in march  interland retired the  shares of stock held as collateral and wrote off the  non recourse promissory note  which had been carried as stockholder s equity 
the other  full recourse promissory note remains outstanding and continues to be a subject of the cobb county litigation noted above 
mr

kocher made inaccurate disclosures in connection with interland s acquisition of communitech 
the complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount 
interland believes that these claims are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on interland and intends to vigorously defend the claims 
in an order dated august   the missouri court dismissed two of the thirteen counts in heitman and murphy s complaint and ordered them to re plead the remaining eleven counts 
in february  the company initiated a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia against the representatives of the former shareholders of hostcentric the hostcentric shareholders  seeking a declaratory judgment that it will be entitled to reimbursement from the escrow fund established as part of the hostcentric acquisition for any amounts over  that it may be required to pay to the landlord for a leased facility in farmingdale  new york  in accordance with the acquisition agreement between the company and hostcentric and its shareholders 
the representatives of the hostcentric shareholders have denied interland s claims and have attempted to assert various counterclaims 
correspondence between the parties has also discussed the possibility of other claims  but these claims have not yet been asserted in litigation 
interland believes its claims in this case are meritorious  that the counterclaims of the former hostcentric shareholders are without merit  plans to continue to contest the matter vigorously and believes that no material adverse effect on interland will occur as a result of this litigation 
in february  the company  through its hostcentric subsidiary  has also initiated a lawsuit in united states district court for southern district of new york against the landlord for the same farmingdale  new york facility  seeking a declaratory judgment that the lease for that facility has been terminated and that the landlord has accepted that termination  thereby eliminating any further obligation on the part of the tenant to make lease payments 
the landlord has denied the claims in the complaint and has asserted counterclaims for approximately  that it claims is past due under the lease 
the landlord may  in the future  assert claims against interland for the balance of payments due under the lease  which claims  the landlord has asserted  could amount to approximately million  in the aggregate 
interland plans to continue to contest the matter vigorously and believes that no material adverse effect on interland will occur as a result of this litigation

on august   the court granted interland s motion for summary judgment 
shortly thereafter  interland filed a motion asking the court to order the plaintiff to pay interland s attorneys fees in defending the action 
subsequently  the parties entered into a settlement agreement providing for the resolution of all outstanding claims and mutual general releases with no resulting material adverse effect on interland 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the plaintiff agreed to interland s continuing use of its bluehalo tm mark and agreed not to contest interland s efforts to register its bluehalo tm mark in the us patent and trademark office

interland believes it has meritworthy defenses to novell s claims 
the litigation is still in the discovery phase 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it used in its discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in its discontinued operation s products or processes  it may be forced to defend legal actions taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology

on june   the company acquired hostcentric  inc  a privately held company that provides a broad range of web hosting services to small business and enterprise customers 
the company s revenue growth prior to was attributable to its acquisitions  and the decline in revenue in was partially offset by the effect of acquisitions 
as a result  the company does not believe its historical financial results are indicative of expected future results 
the company does not anticipate making further acquisitions as a means of growing revenue  but rather it intends to pursue organic growth strategies  including execution of its plans to offer combined website design  development  and management tools to small and medium sized businesses  also referred to as its mainstream market initiative 
the company has no plans to make additional acquisitions for the purpose of adding customers 
during the company continued to develop its organic growth strategy 
during the first half of the company pursued its goal of appealing to the mainstream market primarily by developing products and services it believes are valuable to the target market  and by initiating an effort to distribute these products through direct sales by employees aided by advertising  and supported by a staff of website developers 
by the end of the first half of  however  the company decided to terminate its direct sales efforts in favor of an indirect distribution model in order to decrease the costs of customer acquisition and to accelerate market penetration 
the company incurred a restructuring charge of 
table of contents million in the third quarter associated with this change in distribution approach 
additionally  the company recognized a non cash impairment charge to goodwill and intangible assets in the third quarter of million 
in the fourth quarter the company s financial results reflected the lower costs associated with the indirect model  as well as lower operating costs as the benefits of earlier capital investments and expenses were realized 
for as a whole  the company reported a net loss of million  of which million was attributable to the non cash impairment charges  and million to non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  however  the company reported a net loss of million  of which million was attributable to non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared by management based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets  intangible assets  and contingencies 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
revenue recognition revenues from continuing operations are primarily generated from shared and dedicated internet web hosting  managed services  e commerce services  applications hosting  domain name registrations  and website development services 
revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
hosting contracts generally are for service periods ranging from one to twenty four months and sometimes require up front set up fees  which are deferred and recognized ratably over the customers expected service period 
deferred revenues represent the liability for advance billings to customers for services not yet provided 
the company may permit an early termination of a term contract subject to penalties 
valuation of accounts receivable judgment is required when the company assesses the likelihood of ultimate realization of recorded accounts receivable  including assessing the likelihood of collection and the credit worthiness of customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or their operating climate were to change  resulting in an impairment of either their ability or willingness to make payments  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be required 
similarly  a change in the payment behavior of customers generally may require an adjustment in the calculation of an appropriate allowance 
each month management reviews customer payment patterns  historical credit card charge backs  customer cancellation trends  and comparative aged receivables balances in order to determine the appropriate amount of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable to record 
the majority of customer payments are made by credit card and all trade receivable balances over days are fully reserved 
additionally  all trade balances days or less are reserved at 
the company believes that the current allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate to cover a reasonably expected level of un collectible accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date 
property  plant  equipment and long lived assets the company utilizes significant amounts of property  plant and equipment in providing service to its customers 
for financial statement reporting purposes  the company uses straight line depreciation for property and equipment over our estimate of their useful lives 
the company uses estimated useful lives of three to seven years for equipment and software 
changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
the company periodically confirms the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of property  plant  and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company periodically evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment 
the company tests for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets annually and between annual tests if 
table of contents an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount by determining whether the company s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is ascertained by using quoted values of the company s stock and by using discounted values of expected future cash flows 
if impairment of carrying value based on estimated future cash flows exists  the company measures the impairment through the use of discounted cash flows 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions  and operational considerations 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that other intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
management retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of its intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at may  upon completion of the annual assessment  interland recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to remove the remainder of the carrying value of goodwill 
in addition  the company recorded an impairment charge of million for its other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over an estimate of their period of economic benefit 
contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to class action lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies  is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the company consults with legal counsel and other experts where necessary to assess any contingencies 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company discontinued the operations of its pc systems and spectek business segments 
these segments have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with apb no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  and in this regard an estimate of all retained liabilities was recorded 
the amounts recorded as of the subsequent reported balance sheet dates represent the estimated remaining liabilities 
these amounts are subject to final settlement  which could result in a revision to the estimated loss on the final disposal of these discontinued operations 
restructuring and acquisition related liabilities the company has remaining reserves related to its restructuring programs approved and implemented in fiscal year  and the company also incurred liabilities related to the integration of acquired business during fiscal and these remaining liabilities include an estimate of future lease payments for data centers and office facilities being exited that cannot be recovered through subleases  employee termination costs  and termination penalties for bandwidth and data connectivity contracts we are no longer utilizing 
future actual amounts may differ from these estimates 
results of continuing operations the company s consolidated financial information presents the net effect of discontinued operations separate from the results of the company s continuing operations 
historical financial information has been reclassified to consistently separate and present the results of discontinued operations  and the discussion and analysis that follow generally focuses on continuing operations 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain data derived from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues

the results of continuing operations for fiscal year include all operating activities of the company s acquisitions 
fiscal year includes the operating activities of interland georgia for twelve months  communitech 
net for twelve months  dialtone for twelve months  innerhost for twelve months  trellix for eight months  and  hostcentric for two and one half months 
discontinued operations pc systems in fiscal the company discontinued the operations of its pc systems segment  which was accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the company retained all liabilities of the pc systems business not assumed by gtg pc gores  including  for example  liabilities for taxes arising prior to the closing of the transaction  employee termination and related expenses  and any contingent liabilities arising prior to the closing date 
through may   or for the applicable statute of limitations with respect to taxes and government contracts  the company is obligated to indemnify the purchaser and affiliated entities for any breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the agreement 
in addition  the company is obligated for an indefinite period of time to indemnify 
table of contents the purchaser and affiliated entities for any breaches in covenants 
the agreement provides that the maximum aggregate liability of the company for indemnification under the agreement is million 
to date the company has not made any indemnification payments 
in fiscal  the company recognized a loss of million from discontinued operations 
this loss consisted primarily of required legal fees and reserves in defense and settlement of micron pc legal matters 
the company s micron litigation is ongoing and management expects that there will be additional defense costs in in fiscal  the company recognized a gain of million from discontinued operations 
this gain consisted of a million reduction in the company s liability for micron electronics sales taxes payable with various jurisdictions including a settlement reached with the state of idaho  and a million reduction in the company s liability for micron electronics payroll taxes 
these gains were partially offset by a million increase in required legal reserves and million in other various charges related to discontinued operations 
in fiscal  the company recognized an estimated loss on the disposal of pc systems of million 
included in the loss recognized was a million charge in connection with the resolution of disputed obligations owed to the company by gores 
in addition  the company wrote down certain sales tax receivable balances to their net realizable value  which resulted in a charge of million 
as of august   the company has a sales and use tax assessment and audit reserve of million  million in contingent liabilities  million in legal expenses and for other liabilities related to the disposal of discontinued operations 
comparison of the years ended august    and revenues total revenues decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which represented increase over revenues of million in fiscal fiscal year ended august  august  august  revenues hosting revenue other revenue total revenue hosting revenues decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal hosting revenues are comprised of shared  dedicated  and application hosting services and domain name registrations 
the million decline in hosting revenues during was related to account cancellations  net of new customers obtained through sales and marketing activities  partially offset by the growth in hosting revenues attributable to the hostcentric acquisition 
the million increase in was primarily attributable to acquisitions and new customers obtained through sales and marketing activities  net of account cancellations 
these cancellations occur as a result of a customer action  b termination by the company for non payment  or c termination by the company as a result of a decision to no longer provide a particular service 
consequently  the company has  aside from acquisitions  yet to achieve sustained overall growth in revenue 
other revenues increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal other revenues are primarily comprised of consulting  bandwidth transfer overage billings  internet connectivity fees  co location services  and web based business solution services 
the million increase in is primarily due to million increase in other service revenues from a full year of other services revenues from hostcentric acquisition compared to three months of similar revenues in and the inclusion of trellix other service revenues for the full year compared to seven months in  and million of new bandwidth transfer overage billings in  offset by a decrease in connectivity revenues from the closure of communitech of million 
the increase in other revenues during is primarily due to an increase in consulting services and the inclusion of seven months of trellix revenues  partially offset by a decrease in co location services revenues 
as of august   the company had approximately  paid shared hosting customer accounts and managed nearly  dedicated servers many of which host multiple websites compared to  paid shared hosting customer accounts and  dedicated servers at august  the decrease in shared hosting customer accounts is primarily due to the company s more stringent termination policies applied to delinquent accounts  and voluntary cancellations by customers exceeding new customers acquired 
the company s revenues are highly correlated with the net change in the total of the monthly recurring charges associated with all customer accounts 
the term monthly recurring charges or mrc  does not include one time or variable 
table of contents charges customers may incur  nor is it the same as the actual amount of revenue recognized because  among other things  mrc ignores deferred revenue  and instead uses the charge that applies to a full month 
for revenue recognition purposes a customer who initiates service during the month contributes to revenue the same percentage of the nominal monthly charge as the percentage of the month remaining at inception  a customer who terminates service during the month contributes to revenue the same percentage of the nominal monthly charge as the percentage of the month that elapsed prior to termination 
an initiating customer s entire nominal monthly charge is included in mrc as of the end of the month  but no portion of a terminating customer s nominal monthly charge is included in mrc as of the end the month during which termination occurs 
mrc  therefore  is not a measure of historical revenues but rather a metric for valuing the revenue potential of the entire customer base as of the end of a period 
the company believes that mrc is useful as a reflection of changes in the base of revenue generating customers and  consequently  as a predictor of the direction of revenue in the future 
it is unlikely that interland s future revenues will increase unless net mrc change is positive  and the company does not have a recent history of positive net mrc change aside from mergers and acquisitions 
during the mrc of the company s shared line of business declined from  to  or 
mrc churn mrc of terminating customers as a percentage of beginning mrc averaged  but declined to a average during the fourth quarter 
the company believes that this improvement in churn reflects the company s investments in improving reliability and customer service that has also led to improved customer satisfaction as measured by surveys 
sales produced new shared mrc  which averaged  per month  resulting in an average negative net mrc change of  per month 
the company believes that it is unlikely that shared mrc churn can be reduced below  but believes that its current strategy of increasing new sales through indirect distribution of enhanced products and services has the potential to generate enough new business to exceed the amount of mrc churn and result in positive net mrc change and revenue growth 
during the mrc of the dedicated line of business declined from  to  or 
mrc churn averaged but averaged during the fourth quarter 
new dedicated sales averaged  per month  resulting in an average negative net mrc change of  per month 
the more recent trends  however  have been negative  resulting in average net mrc change during the fourth quarter of negative  the dedicated line of business revenue has been affected  and is likely to continue to be affected  by a general reduction in pricing in the industry 
mrc churn in the dedicated line also is driven by rapid changes in server technology  creating in the customer a desire to seek the latest technology at the lowest price in a highly competitive market 
due to recent increases in mrc churn and price competition  the company is re evaluating the profitability of its dedicated products and seeking alternatives to maximize the company s returns in this market 
the company is now offering many of the products and services it has developed primarily for the shared market to dedicated customers  but due to the capital cost of a server required to service a new dedicated customers they must not only be profitable from an operating standpoint  but must also remain as customers long enough for the company to recoup its investment and provide a satisfactory return on assets employed 
operating costs and expenses network operating costs network operating costs decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which had decreased from million in fiscal the company s network operating costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease is most directly related to the data center consolidation  which was a critical part of the company s restructuring and integration initiative 
that initiative also accounted for a million reduction in bandwidth connectivity costs  a million reduction in service fees and a reduction in occupancy costs 
in addition the company reduced operating lease costs by million as a result of purchasing the underlying leased equipment and a million decrease in domain registration costs 
these cost savings were partially offset by a million increase in employee related costs  a million increase in software costs necessary to support customer product offerings  and a million increase in repair and maintenance costs to maintain network reliability 
network operating costs were reduced by the fourth quarter of  primarily as negotiated bandwidth cost reductions were realized 
total costs averaged million for the first three quarters of the year  but were million in the fourth quarter 
the decrease from to was primarily related to the company s restructuring and integration efforts reducing bandwidth connectivity cost and operating lease costs 
the company currently supports a number of technical platforms  which it acquired from other companies 
compared to a single uniform platform  this situation imposes higher costs because of the need for specialized personnel for both operations and technical support  and in the duplication of effort to make changes to the user interface or operating support system 
the company is exploring means of integrating these platforms in an effort to both improve service and reduce costs 

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had decreased from million in fiscal the company s sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses is directly attributable to functional centralization and much greater use of on line advertising and customer initiated on line sales  and a reduction in reliance on more expensive print advertising and direct mail 
the company believes that it is effective in generating new sales in relation to its expenditures for marketing  advertising  and compensation paid to sales personnel 
as the company makes available a wider range of products and services  increased spending in this area is believed to be likely to positively affect revenue and profitability  particularly in the company s shared line of business 
reflecting the change in distribution approach  the company expended million in sales and marketing expenses during the first half of the year  and during the second half 
technical support technical support expenses increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had decreased from million in fiscal the company s technical support expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in technical support costs is caused by a million increase in employee related costs and a million increase in occupancy expenses 
the increase in spending on technical support reflects the company s commitment to improving customer satisfaction as means of avoiding cancellations 
the company has commissioned surveys of its customers attitudes toward the company  and believes that its increased expenditures have resulted in the effect sought 
nonetheless  operating efficiencies resulting from improved data center reliability reduced technical support expenses from an average of million during the first three quarters of the year to million during the fourth quarter 
the decrease in technical support costs from to  is primarily due to a million reduction in service fees paid to third party providers for support of acquired accounts  a million reduction in professional fee expenses associated with process reengineering initiatives  a million reduction in employee related expenses  and million savings in repairs and maintenance costs 
partially offsetting these reductions were increases in contracted labor expenses of million and occupancy expenses of million 
the company believes that further reductions in the cost component are achievable 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal the company s general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a million decrease in employee related cost  a million decrease in professional fees  and a million reduction in occupancy costs associated with office consolidation 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million increase in legal fees and million increase in insurance expenses  which included a one time payment of million for d o side a coverage 
primarily owing to the shift in distribution strategy the general and administrative expenses during the first three quarters of that averaged million dropped to million for the fourth quarter 
the increase from to was primarily related to a million increase in professional fees primarily related to process improvements  the initial design requirements of a new billing system and the development of the mainstream market initiative  a million increase in legal fees associated with litigation arising from the integration of recent acquisitions and related security registrations costs  an additional million in salary and benefit costs associated with the acquired workforces of innerhost  trellix  and hostcentric  a million increase in staffing relocation costs necessary to complete consolidation initiatives  and a million increase in premiums for director and officer liability insurance 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in occupancy costs associated with office consolidation  a million decrease in allocated service fees  and a million decrease in communication costs as a result of renegotiated contracts with telecom providers 
bad debt expense bad debt expense decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had decreased from million in fiscal the company s bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in bad debt expense is directly attributable to the implementation of more aggressive collection strategies and more stringent non paying account deactivation termination policies 
generally services are suspended when an account becomes thirty days past due and services are terminated if an account ages beyond sixty days 
bad debt expense has been decreasing each quarter as the company s churn has reduced  and as its collection policies took effect 
during  the quarterly bad debt expense was million  million  million  and million  for the fourth  third  second and first quarters of fiscal  respectively 

table of contents the decrease in bad debt expense during fiscal was also attributable to the implementation of more aggressive collection strategies and more stringent non paying account deactivation termination policies 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal the company s depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease from to in depreciation and amortization expense is due to charges in of million in accelerated depreciation and amortization on the assets associated with closed data centers in seattle  los angeles and kansas city and software products acquired through business combinations 
the increase from to in annual depreciation and amortization expense was due to a million of accelerated depreciation on the assets associated with closed data centers in seattle  los angeles and kansas city  b million of accelerated amortization of software products acquired through business combinations  and  c million additional depreciation and amortization charges associated with acquired entities and purchased assets 
restructuring costs restructuring expense decreased to million in from million in  which increased from million in the company has approved and initiated several restructuring plans related to specific consolidation and integration programs 
the three plans approved and implemented are referred to as plan  plan and plan  all of which are noted in further details in the footnotes of the financial statements see footnote restructuring costs 
the decrease from to is primarily due to less restructuring activities 
in march  the company decided to change its approach to distributing its mainstream market hosting solutions from reliance upon a direct field sales force to an indirect channel approach 
due to this decision  the company implemented a restructuring program to reduce its cost structure 
these restructuring charges include costs of million related to lease commitments  and million employee severance and benefits 
the company reduced its reserves related to bandwidth contract obligations from its plan by million as a result of continued negotiations 
the company also increased its reserves under restructuring plan of by million related to lease abandonment obligations as a result of changes in the company s sublease expectations and landlord requirements 
in  the company approved and initiated a program to exit certain facilities and consolidate those operations into other existing facilities 
this restructuring plan was part of management s continued plan to streamline the company s operations and to reduce the long term operating costs 
the plan provided for the closure of three data center facilities  a reduction of those related workforces of approximately employees  and the termination of bandwidth and data connectivity contracts in place at these and other facilities 
the company exited all three data centers by june and recorded a charge of approximately million 
the plan charges consisted of million in lease termination costs  million in bandwidth termination costs  million in employee termination benefits  and in fixed asset related charges 
these plan charges were partially offset by million of various adjustments  including the settlement of certain data connectivity contract obligations for amounts less than the original estimates 
there was a charge for million to property  plant and equipment representing the write down of remaining book value of fixed assets originally written down to their estimated salvage value included in the restructuring charge recorded in plan charges 
also during fiscal  the plan was adjusted in connection with the bandwidth settlements as the early termination costs reserves were reduced by million and lease abandonment liabilities were also reduced by million related to the plan 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to the new plan activity during compared to no new plan activity and several adjustments to reduce prior accruals in during  the liability related to other exit costs was reduced by million in connection with the settlement of certain data connectivity contract obligations for amounts less than the original estimates the liability related to lease abandonments was increased to million due to the impact of revised exit plans pertaining to the company s seattle  washington facility 
the company settled a disputed tenant improvement allowance with the landlord of an exited facility

table of contents goodwill impairment as of may  in accordance with the requirements of sfas  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test which entailed comparing the aggregate market value of the company s outstanding securities plus its liabilities to the aggregate carrying value of the company s assets  including goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets 
the company s market price of its stock has experienced significant volatility over the last fiscal year and closed as of may   with a market value significantly less that the value at the beginning of the fiscal year 
management retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of its tangible and identifiable intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at may  upon completion of the annual assessment  interland recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in fiscal to write off the remaining balance of the carrying value of goodwill 
this compares to a charge of million reduction in fiscal for the company s impairment test as of may  intangible asset impairment the company s aggressive acquisition strategy during and resulted in significant accumulated customer and product related intangible asset balances

net  innerhost and dialtone acquisitions were materially less than previously estimated  due primarily to customer cancellations and company initiated account terminations 
as a result of this assessment  the company determined that these identifiable intangible assets were worth less than their carrying value  and the company consequently recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the asset value to its newly assessed value and a million charge for disposal of software 
this compares to a charge of million in fiscal for the company s impairment test as of may  other expense income  net other expense income  net decreased to a million gain during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal during fiscal the company recognized million gain related to the disposal of long lived assets in accordance with requirements of sfas no

the cause for the decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to the lower levels of funds available for investment and lower interest rates experienced during fiscal  and income tax provision the effective income tax expense rate on continuing operations was approximately for fiscal  compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of for fiscal giving rise to the income tax expense in fiscal is an adjustment to a previously recorded tax benefit receivable 
the effective rates principally reflect the federal statutory rate  net of the effect of state taxes  tax exempt securities and non deductible goodwill amortization  net of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the change in the effective income tax rates primarily reflects tax benefits resulting from a change in the internal revenue code regarding the carry back of net operating losses  as well as a valuation allowance on certain tax assets 
on march   a tax law entitled the job creation and worker assistance act of was passed 
the provision of this act that benefited the company directly during was the ability to carry back tax losses to the previous five years 
during the third quarter of  the company received approximately million in cash relating to the carry back tax refunds and income tax receivables 
this tax refund significantly added to the company s cash position but also reduced the amount of tax net operating losses available for carry forward to future years 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda is defined as net income from continuing operations before i interest income or expense  ii income taxes  and iii depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not an indicator of financial performance under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly captioned information reported by other companies 
in addition  it does not replace net income loss  operating income loss  or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the effect of taxes and interest on interland s net loss is not significant  but depreciation and amortization  primarily as a result of acquisitions  is significant 
the company believes that measuring the performance of the business without

the company s ebitda loss decreased to a loss of million during fiscal from losses of million in fiscal  which had increased from million loss in fiscal the primary cause for the decreased ebitda loss during fiscal was the million and million asset impairment charges recorded against goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  respectively  that were less than the amounts incurred in the following table reflects the calculation of ebitda from continuing operations and a reconciliation to net cash provided by used in operating activities fiscal year ended august  august  august  in thousands net loss depreciation and amortization interest expense income income tax expense benefit discontinued operations ebitda loss from continuing operations interest expense income provision for bad debts gain loss on the sale of assets goodwill and intangible impairment amortization of deferred compensation income tax expense benefit changes in assets and liabilities income tax recoverable receivables other current assets accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue net cash provided by used in operating activities

in the fourth quarter of  million was delivered to one of the company s issuers of directors and officers liability insurance providing a retention deposit for payment of the company s obligations to indemnify officers and directors in the event that the company does not fulfill its obligations directly 
at such time as the company has fulfilled its obligations  the funds will be returned to the company

as of august   the principal balance on the promissory note was million 
the company has pledged million as collateral for this promissory note  this amount will gradually decrease until the agreement terminates in february as of august   the amount of collateral is million 
these restrictions prevent the company from utilizing the related cash and cash equivalents until all of its obligations under the note are satisfied 
the original sale leaseback agreement required payments of  each month with an end of lease buyout amount in july of approximately million

these expenditures  totaling million during fiscal million for capital expenditures and million for 
table of contents operating expenses  were for the purpose of streamlining the company s infrastructure  completing the integration of acquisitions  upgrading internal systems  divesting acquired data centers  and consolidating operations 
the company made capital expenditures of million during fiscal of which million was for the purchase of servers  data center equipment and related software  and million was investment related expenditures for enhancement of our customer facing systems and security upgrades 
during fiscal the company expects a lower level of investment related capital expenditures 
the company expects to spend somewhere between million and million in capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to purchases of servers and data center equipment on an as needed basis with as much re utilization of equipment from cancelled customers as possible 
the company has also invested in an automated asset tracking system to better manage and improve the rate of return on its assets 
the dedicated line of business is particularly sensitive to capital expenditures since each new customer must be provided with a server  either newly purchased  or one which had been provided to a former customer 
to the extent that the dedicated business experiences net growth in customers  additional capital expenditures will be required 
in determining whether to purchase new dedicated servers the company will balance the cost of the investment against the revenue expected  the operating costs necessary to serve the customer  and the likely duration of the relationship with the customer 
consequently  decreases in market pricing and increases in mrc churn make it more difficult to justify investment 
the company s web hosting business has historically incurred net losses and losses from operations 
the company s future operation is dependent upon its ability to achieve and sustain positive cash flow prior to the depletion of cash resources 
the company plans to reduce its level of cash requirements through a decrease in capital purchases and by improving sales and reducing churn 
the company also will have reduced cash outlays for payments associated with prior integration and discontinued operation liabilities and will have reduced debt payments because of the buyout of capital lease obligations during the company expects to continue to have negative cash flows for at least the next four quarters as it continues to execute on its business plan 
there can be no assurance that interland s continuing efforts to stabilize or increase its revenue will be successful and the company will be able to continue as a going concern 
if the company is unable to successfully execute its business plan  it may require additional capital  which may not be available on suitable terms 
nonetheless  management believes it has adequate cash and liquid resources to fund operations and planned capital expenditures through at least the next months

table of contents directors officers insurance during the fiscal year the company determined that issuers of directors and officers insurance coverage have become more likely to refuse to defend and pay claims than in the past  and have been aggressively interpreting policy language in an attempt to avoid claims 
the company also recognized that lawsuits brought against public companies have the potential to result in defense costs  settlement or judgments that may exceed the ability of companies to fulfill their customary indemnification obligations to directors and officers 
consequently  individual officers and directors of the company would face exposure to personal liability for the costs of litigation to determine coverage  to defend claims  and to satisfy judgments or settlements  unless supplemental insurance coverage was obtained 
in order to insure this exposure  during the fourth quarter of the company  entered into contracts with two insurers  which together are designed to provide further assurance that the company s indemnification obligations will be satisfied 
the company purchased a policy of directors and officers insurance  which  in the event of the company s inability to pay  will provide broad coverage to individual officers  and directors in these circumstances customarily referred to as side a coverage 
the company paid  for a three year period of coverage beginning on august  for which the associated expense is recognized ratably over the coverage period 
additionally  the company paid  in august  which was expensed in  to cover prior claims and certain potential claims  and delivered million to the insurer to secure the retained exposure 
these held funds are recorded as other assets  and  to the extent they are not exhausted  will be re delivered to the company when exposure to such claims is extinguished by final resolution of such claims 
in each case these policies do not include most customary exclusions  although no director or officer is provided coverage for fraudulent or illegal acts 
as reported in item legal proceedings  the company has not recorded any reserve for any such claims  consistent with the application of sfas  accounting for contingencies 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors and all other information contained in this form k for the fiscal year ending august  before you make any investment decisions with respect to the company s securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks the company faces 
interland has incurred losses since inception and could incur losses in the future 
interland has incurred net losses and losses from operations for all but one of each quarterly period from its inception through the fourth quarter of fiscal a number of factors could increase its operating expenses  such as adapting network infrastructure and administrative resources to accommodate additional customers and future growth  developing products  distribution  marketing  and management for the mainstream market  broadening customer technical support capabilities  and improving network security features 
to the extent that increases in expenses are not offset by increases in revenues  operating losses will increase 
ours is a recurring revenue subscriber business and as such the effects of a net loss of monthly recurring revenue are magnified 
a large majority of our revenue is derived from the monthly recurring charges mrc incurred by owners of hosted websites 
accordingly  the termination of a single account paying per month will affect revenue every month in the future 
the loss of such a customer at the beginning of a fiscal year will result in a twelve fold reduction in revenue for that fiscal year  and the loss of even one such customer each month of the fiscal year will result in a diminution of times the monthly recurring revenue  or  over the entire fiscal year 
absent the addition of customers through acquisitions  interland has consistently incurred a net loss in mrc  and this situation may continue with material negative effects on reported revenue and net income 
although reductions in mrc may be offset for a time by increases in revenue derived from one time or non recurring charges  the compounding effect of mrc losses will almost certainly eventually result in a meaningful reduction of reported revenue 
moreover  because of interland s relatively low percentage of variable costs  a concomitantly high percentage of the amount of revenue loss results in a loss of ebitda and of net income 
there can be no assurance that interland s continuing efforts to stabilize or increase its mrc and revenue will be successful 
if revenue continues to decline  the company may eventually require additional capital  which may not be available on suitable terms 
although the company can reduce spending to some degree  there can be no assurance in such an event that the company would be able to continue indefinitely as a going concern 

table of contents unfavorable results of existing litigation may cause interland to have additional expenses or operating losses that could exceed the company s ability to pay 
the company is defending a number of matters in active litigation see item  legal proceedings 
the cost of defending lawsuits  regardless of their merit  can be substantial 
the company spent million during to defend lawsuits 
although the company has favorably resolved a number of lawsuits through rulings  verdicts  and minimal settlements  and although the company may be successful in defending ongoing litigation  the costs of defense cannot be expected to be avoided 
the company believes it has appropriately established reserves for the contingency of adverse verdicts 
in order for a loss contingency to be reserved for in the financial statements  gaap requires that the information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements  it is implicit in this condition that it must be probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
therefore  the company has not reserved for all of its pending lawsuits 
consequently lawsuits for which there is no reserve nonetheless pose a risk of substantial loss which would have a material effect on the company s financial position 
additionally  even in those cases where a reserve has been established  the amount of the reserve is necessarily an estimate and the actual result may differ materially 
reserves are established only for the damages that may be assessed  and do not take into account the costs of litigation 
even in those instances where interland may ultimately prevail on appeal  an adverse verdict in a substantial amount may damage the reputation of the company  may require the company to post an appeal bond in an amount which deprives the company of cash  and require additional expenditures for the cost of appeal 
the outcome of litigation is unpredictable  and an adverse final verdict could exceed the company s ability to pay 
because interland s historical financial information is not representative of its future results  investors and analysts will have difficulty analyzing interland s future earnings potential 
because the company has grown through acquisition and its past operating results reflect the costs of integrating these acquisitions  historical results are not representative of future expected operating results 
the company has recognized very sizeable charges and expenditures in the past for impairment charges  restructuring costs  network enhancements  and exploration of the mainstream market 
because these items are not necessarily recurring  it is more difficult for investors to predict future results 
interland has a limited operating history and its business model is still evolving  which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects 
interland s limited operating history makes evaluating its business operations and prospects difficult 
its range of service offerings has changed since inception and its business model is still developing 
interland has changed from being primarily a seller of personal computers and related accessories to being primarily a web hosting and web based value added business solutions provider to small and medium sized businesses company 
because some of its services are new  the market for them is uncertain 
as a result  the revenues and income potential of its business  as well as the potential benefits of its acquisitions  may be difficult to evaluate 
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate  which could cause interland s stock price to be volatile 
past operating results have fluctuated significantly on a quarterly and an annual basis 
quarterly and annual operating results may continue to significantly fluctuate due to a wide variety of factors 
because of these fluctuations  comparing operating results from period to period is not necessarily meaningful  and it would not be meaningful to rely upon such comparisons as an indicator of future performance 
factors that may cause its operating results to fluctuate include  but are not limited to demand for and market acceptance of the company s services and products  introduction of new services or enhancements by interland or its competitors  costs of implementing new network security features  crm systems  and billing modules  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the internet generally or its hosting operations specifically  customer retention  
table of contents increased competition and consolidation within the web hosting and applications hosting markets  changes in its pricing policies and the pricing policies of its competitors  gains or losses of key strategic partner relationships  impairment charges  restructuring charges  merger and integration costs  litigation expenses  insurance expenses  marketing expenses  and seasonality of customer demand interland cannot provide any assurances that it will succeed in its plans to increase the size of its customer base  the amount of services it offers  or its revenues during the next fiscal year and beyond 
in addition  relatively large portions of its expenses are fixed in the short term  and therefore its results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
also  if it cannot continue using third party products in its service offerings  its service development costs could increase significantly 
interland s stock price may be volatile which could cause an investment in its common stock to decrease significantly 
the market price of its common stock has experienced a significant decline 
the price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the following are examples of factors or developments that would likely cause the company s stock price to continue to be volatile variations in operating results and analyst earnings estimates  the volatility of stock within the sectors within which it conducts business  announcements by interland or its competitors regarding introduction of new services  general decline in economic conditions  reductions in the volume of trading in its common stock  and  the company s inability to reduce the rate of account cancellations  or to increase the rate of account additions  or both 
during the weeks ended august  the high and low closing price for interland common stock on nasdaq was and  respectively 
interland operates in a new and evolving market with uncertain prospects for growth and may not be able to generate and sustain growth in its customer base 
interland operates in a new and evolving market with uncertain prospects for growth and may not be able to achieve and sustain growth in its customer base or to maintain its average revenue per customer account arpu 
the market for web hosting and applications hosting services for small and medium sized businesses  and especially the mainstream market  has only recently begun to develop and is evolving rapidly 
interland s future growth  if any  will depend upon the willingness of small and medium sized businesses to purchase web and applications services  interland s ability to increase or at least maintain its average revenues per customer  and its ability to retain customers 
as of august   interland s average monthly revenue per customer account was for shared hosting services and for dedicated hosting services  and its average monthly customer turnover was for shared hosting services and for dedicated hosting services 
the corresponding average monthly revenue per customer as of august  was 
table of contents for shared hosting services and for dedicated hosting services  and the associated average monthly customer turnover rates were for shared hosting services and for dedicated hosting services 
the market for interland s services may not develop further  consumers may not widely adopt its services and significant numbers of businesses or organizations may not use the internet for commerce and communication 
if this market fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected  or if interland s services do not achieve broader market acceptance  interland will not be able to grow its customer base 
in addition  interland must be able to differentiate itself from its competition through its service offerings and brand recognition 
these activities may be more expensive than interland anticipates  and interland may not succeed in differentiating itself from its competitors  achieving market acceptance of its services  or selling additional services to its existing customer base 
because interland s target markets are volatile  the company may face a loss of customers or a high level of non collectible accounts 
the company intends to continue to concentrate on serving the small and medium sized business market 
this market contains many businesses that may not be successful  and consequently present a substantially greater risk for non collectible accounts receivable and for non renewal 
moreover  a significant portion of this target market is highly sensitive to price  and may be lost to a competitor with a lower pricing structure 
because few businesses in this target market employ trained technologists  they tend to generate a high number of customer service and technical support calls 
the expense of responding to these calls is considerable  and the call volume is likely to increase in direct proportion to revenue  potentially limiting the scalability of the business 
additionally  if the customer becomes dissatisfied with the company s response to such calls  cancellation  non payment  or non renewal becomes more likely 
interland s strategy for minimizing the negative aspects of its target market include increased expenditures on sales and marketing programs to replace failing customers  capitalizing on infrastructure efficiencies to become a profitable provider at the lowest sustainable price  automating customer care and technical support to reduce the cost per call  and to minimize the time spent by company personnel  intensive training and supervision of customer care and technical support personnel to maximize customer satisfaction  and  increasing the number and breadth of services to differentiate the company from competition 
the company can give no assurance  however  that any of these measures will be successful  and the company s failure to manage these risks could decrease revenues and profitability 
interland could incur liabilities in the future relating to its pc systems business  which could cause additional operating losses 
interland could incur liabilities from the sale of the pc systems business to gtg pc 
according to the terms of its agreement with gtg pc  it retained liabilities relating to the operation of the pc systems business prior to the closing of the transaction including liabilities for taxes  contingent liabilities and liabilities for accounts payable accrued prior to the closing 
it also agreed to indemnify gtg pc and its affiliates for any breach of its representations and warranties contained in the agreement for a period of two years  or for the applicable statute of limitations for matters related to taxes 
its indemnification obligation is capped at million 
except for claims for fraud or injunctive relief  this indemnity is the exclusive remedy for any breach of its representations  warranties and covenants contained in the agreement with gtg pc 
accordingly  it could be required in the future to make payments to gtg pc and its affiliates in accordance with the agreement  which could adversely affect its future results of operations and cash flows 
to date it has not had to satisfy any such claims 
because interland faces intense competition  it may not be able to operate profitably in its markets 
the web hosting and applications hosting markets are highly competitive  which could hinder interland s ability to successfully market its products and services 
the company may not have the resources  expertise or other competitive factors to compete successfully in the future 
because there are few substantial barriers to entry  the company expects that it will face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
many of interland s current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry and greater resources 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and service offerings more rapidly  
table of contents adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services  and  adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the company can 
current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms and computer hardware suppliers 
these competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and include companies such as yahoo  ntt verio  affinity internet  and earthlink 
impairment of interland s intellectual property rights could negatively affect its business or could allow competitors to minimize any advantage that interland s proprietary technology may give it 
the company currently has no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the web hosting market that it serves 
while it is the company s practice to enter into agreements with all employees and with some of its customers and suppliers to prohibit or restrict the disclosure of proprietary information  the company cannot be sure that these contractual arrangements or the other steps it takes to protect its proprietary rights will prove sufficient to prevent illegal use of its proprietary rights or to deter independent  third party development of similar proprietary assets 
effective copyright  trademark  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which its products and services are offered 
interland currently is  and in the future may be  involved in legal disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights or those of a third party 
intellectual property litigation is typically extremely costly and can be disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
in addition  any adverse decisions could subject it to significant liabilities  require it to seek licenses from others  prevent it from using  licensing or selling certain of its products and services  or cause severe disruptions to operations or the markets in which it competes which could decrease profitability 
periodically  it is made aware of claims  or potential claims  that technology it used in its discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of several asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement relating to its discontinued operations prior to the balance sheet date 
resolution of these claims could be costly and decrease profitability 
if interland is unable to attract and retain key personnel  it may not be able to compete effectively in its market 
the future success of interland will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
the company attempts to enhance its management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas 
the company experiences strong competition for such personnel in the web hosting industry 
the company s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  information technology  engineering  and technical support resources could adversely affect its ability to remain competitive in its markets 
the company has and may continue to face the loss of key personnel  which could limit the ability of the company to develop and market its products and services 
interland depends on its reseller sales channel to market and sell many of its services 
interland does not control its resellers  and if it fails to develop or maintain good relations with resellers  it may not achieve the growth in customers and revenues that it expects 
an element of the strategy for the company s growth is to further develop the use of third parties that resell or recommend its services 
many of these resellers are web development or web consulting companies that also sell interland s web hosting services  but that generally do not have established customer bases to which they can market these services 
the company is not currently dependent on any one reseller to generate a significant level of business  but it has benefited and continues to significantly benefit from business generated by the reseller channel 
although interland attempts to provide its resellers with incentives such as price discounts on its services that the resellers seek to resell at a profit  the failure of its services to be commercially accepted in some markets  whether as a result of a reseller s performance or otherwise  could cause its current resellers to discontinue their relationships with the company 
the company also is developing relationships with larger distribution partners  and although the percentage of the company s current revenues generated by any of these relationships is currently small  if the company s strategy is successful  future revenue growth will be dependent on the success and maintenance of these relationships 

table of contents interland is vulnerable to system failures  which could harm its reputation  cause its customers to seek reimbursement for services  and cause its customers to seek another provider for services 
the company must be able to operate the systems that manage its network around the clock without interruption 
its operations will depend upon its ability to protect its network infrastructure  equipment and customer files against damage from human error  fire  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
the company s networks are currently subject to various points of failure 
for example  a problem with one of its routers devices that move information from one computer network to another or switches could cause an interruption in the services the company provides to a portion of its customers 
in the past  the company has experienced periodic interruptions in service 
the company has also experienced  and in the future it may continue to experience  delays or interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of internet users  current and former employees  or others 
any future interruptions could cause customers or end users to seek damages for losses incurred  require the company to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities  damage the company s reputation for reliable service  cause existing customers to cancel their contracts  or make it more difficult for the company to attract new customers 
interland s data centers and network vulnerability to security breaches could cause disruptions in its service  liability to third parties  or loss of customers 
a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the need for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
some of the company s services rely on security technology licensed from third parties that provides the encryption and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of confidential information 
despite the design and implementation of a variety of network security measures by the company  unauthorized access  computer viruses  accidental or intentional actions and other disruptions could occur 
in addition  inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information  such as credit card and bank account numbers stored in the company s computer systems 
these security problems could result in the company s liability and could also cause the loss of existing customers and potential customers 
although the company continues to implement industry standard security measures  third parties may be able to overcome any measures that it implements 
the costs required to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems could be prohibitively expensive and the efforts to address such problems could result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service to customers  and harm the company s reputation and growth 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
disruption of interland s services caused by unknown software or hardware defects could harm its business and reputation 
the company s service offerings depend on complex software and hardware  including proprietary software tools and software licensed from third parties 
complex software and hardware may contain defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company may not discover software or hardware defects that affect its new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
although interland has not experienced any material software or hardware defects to date  it is possible that defects may exist or occur in the future 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage its reputation or increase its service costs  cause it to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert its development resources 
providing services to customers with critical websites and web based applications could potentially expose interland to lawsuits for customers lost profits or other damages 
because the company s web hosting and applications hosting services are critical to many of its customers businesses  any significant interruption in those services could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to its customers as well as negative publicity and additional expenditures for it to correct the problem 
although the standard terms and conditions of the company s customer contracts disclaim liability for any such damages  a customer could still bring a lawsuit against it claiming lost profits or other consequential damages as the result of a service interruption or other website or application problems that the customer may ascribe to it 
a court might not enforce any limitations on its liability  and the outcome of any lawsuit would depend on the specific facts of the case and legal and policy considerations 
table of contents even if the company believes it would have meritorious defenses to any such claims 
in such cases  it could be liable for substantial damage awards 
such damage awards might exceed its liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts  which would seriously harm its business 
interland could face liability for information distributed through its network 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or distributed through their networks is currently unsettled 
online services companies could be subject to claims under both united states and foreign law for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  violation of securities laws or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials distributed through their networks 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose such liability upon other entities are currently pending against other companies 
in addition  organizations and individuals have sent unsolicited commercial e mails from servers hosted by service providers to massive numbers of people  typically to advertise products or services 
this practice  known as spamming  can lead to complaints against service providers that enable such activities  particularly where recipients view the materials received as offensive 
the company may  in the future  receive letters from recipients of information transmitted by its customers objecting to such transmission 
although the company prohibits its customers by contract from spamming  it cannot provide assurances that its customers will not engage in this practice  which could subject it to claims for damages 
in addition  the company may become subject to proposed legislation that would impose liability for or prohibit the transmission over the internet of some types of information 
other countries may also enact legislation or take action that could impose liability on the company or cause it not to be able to operate in those countries 
the imposition upon the company and other online services of potential liability for information carried on or distributed through its systems could require it to implement measures to reduce its exposure to this liability  which may require it to expend substantial resources  or to discontinue service offerings 
the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals also could affect the rate of growth of internet use 
interland s business operates in an uncertain legal environment where future government regulation and lawsuits could restrict interland s business or cause unexpected losses 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  laws and regulations with respect to the internet may be adopted at federal  state and local levels  covering issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with internet communications 
the company cannot fully predict the nature of future legislation and the manner in which government authorities may interpret and enforce such legislation 
as a result  interland and its customers could be subject to potential liability under future legislation  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations might decrease the growth of the internet which in turn could decrease the demand for the company s services  or increase the cost of doing business 
in addition  applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
these laws generally pre date the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not consider or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
substantial future sales of shares by shareholders could negatively affect interland s stock price 
a number of groups of investors hold substantial numbers of interland shares  including the former shareholders of acquired companies  and hedge funds reported to have investment styles that lead to short term holdings 
substantial sales by these holders may adversely affect interland s stock price
