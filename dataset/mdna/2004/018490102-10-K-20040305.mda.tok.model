item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our financial condition at december  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the caption certain factors and trends affecting allergan and its businesses in item of part i of this report 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
we generally offer cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables 
those discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded 
the amount reserved for cash discounts was million at december  and we permit returns of product from any product line by any class of customer if such product is returned in a timely 
table of contents manner  in good condition and from the normal channels of distribution 
return policies in certain international markets provide for more stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
allowances for returns are provided for based upon an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
the amount of allowances for sales returns reserved at december  and were million and million  respectively 
additionally  we participate in various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs  the largest of which relates to medicaid 
sales rebate and incentive accruals reduce revenue in the same period that the related sale is recorded and are included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
the accruals for sales rebates and other incentive programs are based on estimates of the proportion of sales that are subject to such rebates and incentive programs 
the amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at december  and were million and million  respectively 
historical allowances for cash discounts  product returns and rebates and incentives have been within the amounts reserved or accrued  respectively 
however  material differences may result in the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales if the actual amount of product returns and the amount of rebates and incentives differ materially from the amounts estimated by management 
pensions we sponsor various pension plans in the us and abroad in accordance with local laws and regulations 
in connection with these plans  we use certain actuarial assumptions to determine the plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations  the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
our assumption for the expected long term rate of return on assets in our us pension plan to determine the net periodic benefit cost is for  which represents a decline from our expected rate of return of 
we determine  based upon recommendations from our pension plans investment advisors  the expected rate of return using a building block approach that considers diversification and rebalancing for a long term portfolio of invested assets 
our investment advisors study historical market returns and preserve long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in a manner consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
they also evaluate market factors such as inflation and interest rates before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
the expected rate of return is applied to the market related value of plan assets 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the return on assets assumption would increase our expected us pre tax pension benefit cost by approximately million 
the discount rate used to calculate our us pension benefit obligations at december  is  which represents a decline from our december  rate of 
we determine the discount rate largely based upon an index of high quality fixed income investments us moody s aa corporate long bond yield average at the plans measurement date 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the discount rate assumption would increase our expected us pre tax pension benefit costs by approximately million and increase our us pension plans projected benefit obligations at december  by approximately million 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of lower tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions and r d tax credits available in the united states 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the fiscal year as new information is obtained which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax audit issues and settlements  utilization of r d tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to 
table of contents reduce the net carrying value to an amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
material differences may result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes if the actual amounts for valuation allowances required against deferred tax assets differ from the amounts estimated by us 
withholding and us taxes have not been provided for the unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have reinvested or expect to reinvest these earnings permanently in such operations 
at december   we had approximately million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax expense would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
upon remittance  certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available  subject to certain limitations  for use as credits against our us tax liability  if any 
purchase price allocation the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
the aggregate purchase price for oculex pharmaceuticals  inc oculex and bardeen sciences company  llc bardeen of approximately million and million  respectively  was allocated to identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
oculex was determined to be a business combination  while bardeen was considered to be an asset acquisition and not a business combination 
accordingly  we have provided pro forma financial information in our financial statements to reflect the effect of the oculex acquisition on our historical operating results  but have not done so for the bardeen acquisition 
see note  acquisitions  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report 
we determined that the assets acquired from oculex and bardeen consisted principally of incomplete in process research and development and that these projects had no alternative future uses in their current state 
we reached this conclusion based on discussions with our business development and research and development personnel  our review of long range product plans and our review of a valuation report prepared by an independent valuation specialist 
the valuation specialist s report reached a conclusion with regard to the fair value of the in process research and development assets in a manner consistent with principles prescribed in the aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries 
in connection with the acquisition of oculex  we determined that the assets acquired also included a proprietary technology drug delivery platform which was separately valued and capitalized as core technology 
we reached this conclusion based on our determination that the acquired technology had alternative future uses in its current state 
we consulted with our independent auditor in arriving at the determination to record a charge to in process research and development expense and to capitalize core technology 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
discontinued operations on june   we completed the spin off of our optical medical device business to our stockholders 
the optical medical device business consisted of two businesses our ophthalmic surgical products business  which developed  manufactured and marketed products that included artificial lenses for the eye  called intraocular lenses  and equipment for cataract and refractive eye surgery  and our contact lens care products business  which developed  manufactured and marketed a broad range of products for use with every available type of contact lens 
the spin off was effected by contributing our optical medical device business to a newly 
table of contents formed subsidiary  advanced medical optics  inc  and issuing a dividend of advanced medical optics common stock to our stockholders 
the common stock of advanced medical optics began trading publicly on the new york stock exchange on july  under the symbol avo 
as a result of the spin off  we continue to own and operate our specialty pharmaceutical business  and advanced medical optics owns and operates what was formerly our optical medical device business 
we have no ownership interest in advanced medical optics 
our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained herein have been recast to reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of advanced medical optics as a discontinued operation 
we did not account for our ophthalmic surgical and contact lens care businesses as a separate legal entity 
therefore  the following selected financial data for our discontinued operations is presented for informational purposes only and does not necessarily reflect what the net sales or earnings would have been had the businesses operated as a stand alone entity 
the financial information for our discontinued operations includes allocations of certain of our expenses to those operations 
these amounts have been allocated to our discontinued operations on the basis that is considered by management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to  or the benefit obtained by  those operations 
see note  discontinued operations  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report 
effective with the third quarter of our fiscal year  we no longer include the results of operations and cash flows of our discontinued optical medical device business in our consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth selected financial data of our discontinued operations 
selected financial data for discontinued operations year ended december  in millions net sales earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax through the end of  actual costs incurred by us related to the spin off of advanced medical optics  including restructuring and duplicate operating expenses  were approximately million  including million of costs incurred prior to this amount excludes million in costs incurred in that were allocated to discontinued operations 
during  we reversed approximately million of our restructuring charge related to the spin off of advanced medical optics due to adjustments to certain estimated amounts 
through the end of  we also paid million for various taxes  net of amounts associated with a tax sharing agreement with advanced medical optics  related to intercompany purchases of assets by advanced medical optics prior to the spin off that were deferred and charged to retained earnings as part of the dividend of advanced medical optics stock to our stockholders 
additionally  we believe we have incurred approximately million to million of additional annual net costs associated with dissynergies  contract manufacturing arrangements and changes to cost and debt capital structure as a result of the separation of advanced medical optics from us 
we began to incur these additional costs during the second half of  and they are not reflected in our results of continuing operations for the first half of our manufacturing and supply agreement with advanced medical optics is scheduled to terminate on june   at which time we could possibly incur between million and million of additional restructuring costs associated with the completion of that agreement and expected exit activities 
continuing operations headquartered in irvine  california  we are a technology driven  global health care company that develops and commercializes specialty pharmaceutical products for the ophthalmic  neurological  dermatological and other specialty markets 
we employ approximately  persons around the world 
we are an 
table of contents innovative leader in therapeutic and over the counter products that are sold in more than countries 
our principal markets are the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
results of continuing operations we operate our business on the basis of a single reportable segment specialty pharmaceuticals 
we produce a broad range of ophthalmic products for glaucoma therapy  ocular inflammation  infection  allergy and dry eye  skin care products for acne  psoriasis and other prescription and over the counter dermatological products  and botox for certain therapeutic and cosmetic indications 
we provide global marketing strategy teams to ensure development and execution of a consistent marketing strategy for our products in all geographic regions that share similar distribution channels and customers 
the following discussion reflects our results of continuing operations  unless otherwise indicated 
management evaluates its various product portfolios on a revenue basis  which is presented below 
we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measure of constant currency sales 
constant currency sales represent current period reported sales  adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year 
we calculate the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported amounts  calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year  to the actual current period reported amounts 
we routinely evaluate our net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of our sales 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower  respectively  than growth reported at actual exchange rates 
the following tables compare net sales by product line and certain selected products for the years ended december   and year ended december  change in net sales percent change in net sales total performance currency total performance currency in millions net sales by product line eye care pharmaceuticals botox neuromodulator skin care total other total net sales domestic international selected product sales alphagan p and alphagan lumigan other glaucoma restasis n a n a n a tazorac  zorac and avage other sales primarily consist of sales to advanced medical optics pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement entered into as part of the spin off of advanced medical optics

the million increase in net sales from the impact of foreign currency changes for as compared to was due primarily to the strengthening of the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar and japanese yen  partially offset by weakness in the brazilian real and other latin american currencies compared to the us dollar 
the million decline in net sales from the impact of foreign currency changes for as compared to was due primarily to the weakness in the brazilian real and other latin american currencies  partially offset by a strengthening of the euro compared to the us dollar 
the million increase in net sales in compared to was the result of increases in sales in all three product lines  and an increase in other non pharmaceutical product sales  which consist primarily of contract manufacturing sales to advanced medical optics 
eye care pharmaceutical net sales increased in compared to net sales in primarily because of strong growth in sales of our glaucoma drug lumigan  our alphagan ophthalmic solutions product line for glaucoma  which includes both alphagan p and alphagan  new product sales of million generated from the second quarter initial launch of restasis  growth in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh  and a net increase in sales of other eye care pharmaceutical products 
we estimate the majority of the change in our eye care pharmaceutical sales was due to mix and volume changes  however  we increased the published prices for certain of our eye care pharmaceutical products in the us effective april  this increase in prices had a subsequent positive net effect on our us sales  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our products at an amount between one to two months of our net sales 
during  us sales of ocuflox  an older anti infective  began to decline in the third quarter as sales of zymar tm  a newer anti infective and the first fourth generation fluoroquinilone to enter the us market  grew substantially 
in future periods  we expect sales of ocuflox to continue to decline as sales of zymar tm continue to increase and as we lose patent protection for ocuflox in the united states and face possible generic competition beginning in mid we continue to believe the introduction of generic formulations of the first generation of alphagan  the first of which was approved by the fda in the second quarter of followed by a second generic formulation being approved in the third quarter of  will have a negative impact on the net sales for our alphagan franchise 

table of contents botox sales increased in compared to as a result of strong growth in both the united states and international markets 
in  therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total botox net sales  and cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total botox net sales 
both therapeutic and cosmetic net sales grew approximately in constant currency in compared to international botox sales growth in compared to benefited from the march launch in france of vistabel  the european trade name for botox cosmetic 
effective december   we increased the published price for botox and botox cosmetic in the us by approximately six percent  which had a corresponding positive effect on our us sales growth in effective december   we increased the published price for botox and botox cosmetic in the us by approximately seven percent  which we believe will have a positive effect on our us sales growth in we believe our worldwide market share as of december  is over for neuromodulators  including botox 
skin care net sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong sales of tazorac in the united states  where it is fda approved to treat both psoriasis and acne  and the launch in the first quarter of of our new product avage tm 
the million increase in net sales in compared to was the result of increases in sales in all product lines  especially botox and eye care pharmaceuticals 
other sales primarily consist of contract manufacturing sales to advanced medical optics 
eye care pharmaceutical sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong sales growth in our relatively new glaucoma drug lumigan and increased sales from refresh  ocuflox and alocril 
eye care pharmaceutical sales were negatively impacted in by a decrease in sales of the alphagan ophthalmic solutions product line for glaucoma 
this decline was the result of our decision in the third quarter of to discontinue the us distribution of alphagan and to focus our manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts on our improved brimonidine solution  alphagan p 
botox sales increased in compared to as a result of strong growth in both the united states and international markets 
botox sales growth benefited significantly from the april approval of botox cosmetic by the fda for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adult men and women age or younger 
we believe our worldwide market share as of december  was over for neuromodulators  including botox 
although the market for neuromodulators continues to expand  the rate of growth of botox was slightly reduced by the introduction of a competitive neuromodulator in skin care sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong sales growth of tazorac in the united states where it is fda approved to treat both psoriasis and acne 
the percentage of us sales in as a percentage of total product net sales declined percentage points to compared to us sales of in  due primarily to a decrease in us eye care pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of total product net sales in compared to resulting from strong sales growth rates in europe  partially offset by an increase in the percentage of us other contract manufacturing sales due to the growth in sales to advanced medical optics 
the percentage of us sales in as a percentage of total product net sales increased percentage points to from in  due primarily to an increase in us botox sales and other contract manufacturing sales  partially offset by a decline in us eye care pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of total product net sales

the gross margin percentage for eye care pharmaceuticals declined in compared to due to an increase in the mix of international sales and products with higher royalty rates payable to third parties 
the increase in gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily the result of shifts in the product mix of sales and a general increase in the gross margins of all product lines 
higher margin botox sales represented a greater percentage of sales compared to the increase in gross margin percentage in was partially offset by low margin contract manufacturing sales to advanced medical optics  a million charge to cost of sales related to the restructuring charge and asset write off  and million of duplicate operating expenses charged to cost of sales primarily for salaries  training expenses  equipment and personnel relocation costs and product label changeover costs associated with the spin off of advanced medical optics

research services margin we have historically recognized research service revenues and costs associated with various contract research and development arrangements 
research service revenues and costs have declined in compared to and as a result of our acquisition of bardeen sciences company  llc in and allergan 
table of contents specialty therapeutics  inc in as of december   we are not a party to any contract research and development arrangements similar to those previously reported

the increase in selling  general and administrative expense dollars in compared to  excluding duplicate operating expenses  was a result of higher promotion  selling and marketing expenses supporting the increase in sales  especially for botox and our lumigan and alphagan p products in the united states 
promotion and marketing expenses increased in compared to primarily as a result of the increase in botox sales fueled by the launch of botox cosmetic in north america  costs associated with the anticipated launch of vistabel  the trade name for botox cosmetic in europe  and higher selling expenses for eye care pharmaceuticals and skin care products driven by the launch of lumigan in europe  canada  australia and various asian countries  as well as increased sales of tazorac in the united states 
selling  general and administrative expenses in also included higher costs associated with establishing a new specialist pediatric sales force in the united states 
excluding duplicate operating expenses in and  the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in promotion  selling  marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
this decrease resulted primarily from the relatively high amount of expenses incurred in for promotion  selling and marketing activities related to the promotion of alphagan p in the united states and to the product launch of lumigan in europe and other international markets 
the decrease also resulted from cost reduction efforts in affecting european administration functions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in promotion and selling expenses  partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales

settlement  restructuring charges and asset write offs  duplicate operating expenses in the third quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of million related to a global settlement with pharmacia corporation and columbia university resolving all intellectual property disputes regarding lumigan  covering two separate patent infringement lawsuits in the united states and a number of lawsuits and patent oppositions in europe 
the charge provides for the settlement of all litigation and potential past damages 
we recorded a million pre tax charge for restructuring costs and asset write offs for the year ended december   associated with the advanced medical optics spin off  as more fully described in note  discontinued operations  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report 
this restructuring charge consisted primarily of employee severance  facility closure and consolidation costs  asset write offs and other costs  all substantially related to the advanced medical optics spin off 
the assets written off consisted primarily of manufacturing machinery and equipment  a building and various building improvements that were impaired or demolished in connection with the advanced medical optics spin off 
the full year restructuring charge also included asset write offs of million unrelated to the advanced medical optics spin off 
included in other costs within the net charge during is million of inventory write offs that have been recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
during  we adjusted our restructuring charge estimates  resulting in certain reclassifications between restructuring activities and a net restructuring charge reversal of million 
the restructuring and spin off activities included a workforce reduction of positions consisting of manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative positions over a one year period 
as of december   severance payments totaling million have been made to terminated employees since january a total of and manufacturing positions during the year ended december  and  respectively  included in the original position reduction did not require severance payments as certain employees terminated their employment prior to the date they would have qualified for severance or transferred to unfilled positions in other areas within the company

duplicate operating expenses included advisory fees  salary and recruiting costs  product and regulatory transition costs  equipment and personnel relocation costs and other business transition expenses 
duplicate operating expenses have been included in the normal operating expense classifications to which they relate on the consolidated statements of operations 
during  we recorded a million pre tax restructuring charge  of which million was recorded to continuing operations and million to discontinued operations 
the restructuring charge represented the costs of a comprehensive plan to streamline operations and reduce costs through reductions in global general and administrative staff and the closure of manufacturing facilities in connection with the outsourcing and consolidation of manufacturing operations 
in addition  operations in many countries were transferred to distributors  and business activities were concentrated into regional shared service centers 
in  we reviewed all restructuring activities related to the restructuring charge and determined that all activities were completed 
as a result  the remaining accrual of million  representing primarily an accrual for severance and facility closure costs  was eliminated  and a corresponding benefit was recorded to continuing operations 
operating income our operating loss was million  or of product net sales in  compared to operating income of million  or of product net sales in  and million  or of product net sales in the decrease in operating income of million in compared to was primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses of million  which includes million of pre tax charges for in process research and development associated with the acquisitions in of bardeen sciences company  llc and oculex pharmaceuticals  inc the decrease in operating income also resulted from the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  partially offset by the million increase in gross margin  the absence of the legal settlement charge of million in and a decrease in the restructuring charge and asset write offs of million

interest expense declined million to million in compared to million in  primarily due to lower interest expense on foreign debt and a favorable net change in mix of other interest bearing obligations 
loss on investments in and were million and million  respectively  representing the other than temporary impairment of certain third party investments and related collaborations 
at december   we had a carrying amount of million with a cost basis of million in third party equity investments and notes receivable with public and privately held companies 
these investments and notes are subject to review for other than temporary declines in fair value on a quarterly basis 
during  we recorded net unrealized losses on derivative instruments of million compared to net unrealized losses of million in and net unrealized gains of million in other  net expenses were million in compared to zero in and other  net income of million in in  other  net primarily includes million of net losses on the abandonment of fixed assets  million of expenses related to accruals for the settlement of non income foreign tax compliance matters in latin america and europe  and million of expenses related to the write off of unamortized debt origination fees associated with the retirement of the remaining balance of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of  which were not previously redeemed in december other  net in primarily includes expenses of million related to the early redemption of a substantial portion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes in december  offset by a million gain on sale of a facility and a million benefit resulting from the settlement of a collaboration relationship 
in  other  net includes income of million associated with the mutual termination of a selling alliance agreement and a million gain from the divestiture of certain pharmaceutical products in latin america 
income taxes our effective tax rate in was compared to the effective tax rate of in included in our operating loss in are pre tax charges of million and million for in process research and development associated with our acquisitions of bardeen sciences company  llc and oculex pharmaceuticals  inc  respectively 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to the bardeen charge because the acquisition was considered to be an asset acquisition for tax purposes whereas no income tax benefit was recorded for the oculex charge because the acquisition was considered to be an acquisition of stock 
excluding the impact of the total million of in process research and development charges and related tax benefit of million  our adjusted effective tax rate for was 
the increase in the adjusted effective tax rate to in compared to the effective tax rate of in was primarily attributable to the change in mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and an increase in the us tax effect on foreign earnings and foreign dividends  partially offset by decreases in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million and estimated reserves for tax audit settlements of million and an increase in the benefit from research and development tax credits

table of contents expected changes in the mix of earnings  the absence in of the decrease in the valuation allowance and reserves for tax audit settlements experienced in  and the expected mid year expiration of the us research and development tax credit 
our effective tax rate in was  down from the effective tax rate in included in operating income is a million charge for in process research and development associated with our acquisition of allergan specialty therapeutics  inc in the second quarter of we did not record an income tax benefit for this charge 
excluding the negative impact of the million in process research and development charge  our effective tax rate would have been 
the percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate in to compared to our adjusted effective tax rate in of was primarily attributable to a decrease in the effect of the provision for us taxes on foreign earnings and foreign dividends  a decrease due to the realization of certain intangible deductions and an increase in research and development tax credits  partially offset by a decrease in the benefit from the tax differential on foreign earnings 
net earnings our loss from continuing operations in was million compared to earnings from continuing operations of million in the million decrease in earnings from continuing operations was primarily the result of the million decrease in operating income  partially offset by a decrease in total non operating expenses of million and a decrease in the provision for income taxes of million

liquidity and capital resources management assesses our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund our operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity include funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  the extent of our stock repurchase program  funds required for acquisitions  adequate credit facilities  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements 
the net cash provided by continuing operations was million in compared to million in and million in operating cash flow from continuing operations increased in compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in earnings from continuing operations  including the effect of adjusting for non cash items  which were positively affected by the absence in of the lumigan legal settlement charge and duplicate operating expenses related to the spin off of advanced medical optics  which were incurred in  a decrease in cash required to fund trade receivables and inventory growth  an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities  a decrease in income taxes paid  and a decrease in pension contributions which primarily affected the prepaid benefit cost for pensions included in other non current assets  partially offset by an increase in other non current assets  including intangibles 
we paid pension contributions of million in compared to million in the higher amount of pension contributions in compared to was due to our desire to maintain the fair value of certain pension plans assets at an amount greater than their respective accumulated benefit obligations 
in  we expect to pay pension contributions of between approximately million and million 
at december   we disclosed consolidated unrecognized net actuarial losses of million which were included in our reported net prepaid benefit cost 
the unrecognized actuarial losses resulted 
table of contents primarily from lower than expected investment returns on plan assets in and and decreases in the discount rates used to measure projected benefit obligations that occurred over the past three years 
assuming constant actuarial assumptions estimated as of our pension plans measurement date of september   we expect the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses to increase our total pension costs by approximately million in  million in and million in compared to the amortization of approximately million of unrecognized actuarial losses included in pension costs expensed in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses gains included in pension costs in and was million and million  respectively 
the future amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses is not expected to materially affect future pension contribution requirements 
operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased in compared to primarily as a result of the decrease in earnings from continuing operations  including the effect of non cash items  which were negatively affected principally by the lumigan legal settlement charge and duplicate operating costs associated with the spin off of advanced medical optics 
operating cash flow was also negatively affected in compared to primarily by an increase in accounts receivable  principally in north america  an increase in inventories  primarily raw materials related to the manufacturing and supply agreement with advanced medical optics and botox inventories  an increase in income taxes paid and an increase in other non current assets related to pension contributions of million in compared to pension contributions of million in net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in excluding net cash paid of million for the acquisitions of bardeen sciences company  llc and oculex pharmaceuticals  inc in and million for the acquisition of allergan specialty therapeutics  inc in  cash used in investing activities would have been million in and million in we invested million for new facilities and equipment during compared to million in and million in see capital expenditures below for additional discussion regarding our capital expenditures 
during and  the additions to property  plant and equipment included costs to construct a major new research and development facility in irvine  california  which we expect to complete in capital expenditures in also included initial construction costs for expansion of botox manufacturing facilities in ireland 
net cash used in investing activities includes million  million and million to acquire software in  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  composed primarily of million for purchases of treasury stock  million for payment of dividends and million for repayments of convertible borrowings and long term debt

net cash used in financing activities was million in  composed primarily of million for payments of dividends and million for purchases of treasury stock 
cash in the amount of million was provided by the sale of stock to employees 
we maintain an evergreen stock repurchase program 
our evergreen stock repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock for the primary purpose of funding our stock based benefit plans 
under the stock repurchase program  we may maintain up to million repurchased shares in our treasury account at any one time 
as of december   we held approximately million treasury shares under this program 
we are uncertain as to the level of stock repurchases to be made in the future 
net cash provided by discontinued operations was million and million in and  respectively 
the amount includes one time cash receipts from advanced medical optics resulting from the sale of certain assets to advanced medical optics in connection with its formation and restructuring and a capital distribution received by us just prior to the spin off of advanced medical optics 

table of contents at december   we had a committed domestic long term credit facility  a committed foreign line of credit in japan  a commercial paper program  a medium term note program  and an unused debt shelf registration statement that we may use for a new medium term note program 
the committed domestic credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million through the committed foreign line of credit allows for borrowings of up to approximately million through the commercial paper program also provides for up to million in borrowings 
however  we do not currently intend to have combined borrowings under our committed credit facilities and our commercial paper program that would exceed million in the aggregate 
the current medium term note program allows us to issue up to an additional million in registered notes on a non revolving basis 
the debt shelf registration statement provides for up to million in additional debt securities 
borrowings under the domestic credit facility and medium term note program are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  maintaining minimum debt to capitalization ratios and minimum consolidated net worth 
certain covenants also limit subsidiary debt and restrict dividend payments 
we were in compliance with these covenants and had approximately million available for dividends at december  at december   we had no borrowings under our domestic committed credit facility  million in borrowings outstanding under our committed foreign line of credit  million in borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program  million in borrowings under various foreign bank loans and million in borrowings outstanding under the current medium term note program 
in april  we exchanged in a private offering million of our medium term notes which were to mature on april  for new notes due april  with terms that are not substantially different from the terms of the previously existing medium term notes 
on november   we issued zero coupon convertible senior notes due in a private placement with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
the notes  which were issued at a discount of million  are unsecured and accrue interest at annually  maturing on november  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock for each  principal amount at maturity if the closing price of our common stock exceeds certain levels  the credit ratings assigned to the notes are reduced below specified levels  or we call the notes for redemption  make specified distributions to our stockholders or become a party to certain consolidation  merger or binding share exchange agreements 
upon conversion  we may choose to deliver  in lieu of our shares of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
we currently intend to settle the accreted value of the zero coupon convertible senior notes due in cash 
as of december   the conversion criteria had not been met 
see note  convertible notes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a description of the conversion features 
on december   we paid million to redeem a substantial portion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million and a net book value at the time of redemption of million after adjusting for the unamortized discount 
we recorded a pre tax loss of million in connection with the early retirement that included the million prepayment premium  the write off of million of deferred debt issue costs and other costs of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we retired the remaining outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated notes not redeemed in  which had a net book value at the time of redemption of million  and we recorded a pre tax loss of million related to the write off of the deferred debt issue costs 
see note  convertible notes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report 
a substantial portion of our existing cash and equivalents are held by non us subsidiaries 
we currently plan to use these funds in our operations outside the united states 
withholdings of us taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have reinvested or expect to reinvest these earnings permanently in such operations 
as of december   we had approximately million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax costs would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 

table of contents we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
capital expenditures expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million in  million in and million in expenditures in and included initial construction costs for a new research and development facility at our irvine  california campus 
expenditures in included expansion of manufacturing facilities  principally for botox production in ireland  and a variety of other projects designed to improve productivity 
in  we began construction on a new biologics facility to be located on our irvine  california campus 
we expect to invest approximately million to million in additional construction costs for expansion of manufacturing capacity and laboratory facilities  and other property  plant and equipment in inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our revenues in were derived from operations outside the us  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was as follows a million increase in  a million decrease in  and a million decrease in the sales increase included increases of million related to the euro  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the australian dollar and million related to the japanese yen  partially offset by decreases of million related to the mexican peso  million related to the brazilian real and million related to other latin american currencies 
the sales decrease included decreases of million related to the brazilian real and million related to other latin american currencies  partially offset by an million increase related to the euro 
the sales decrease was due primarily to a weakening of european currencies  the brazilian real and the japanese yen

oculex pharmaceuticals  inc on november   we purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of oculex pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately owned company  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired  including transaction costs of million and million in other assets related to oculex 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the consolidated statements of operations include the results of oculex beginning november  in conjunction with the acquisition  we recorded a charge to research and development for in process research and development expense of million during for an acquired in process research and development asset which we determined was not yet complete and had no alternative future uses in its current state 
this asset is oculex s lead investigational product  posurdex  which is a proprietary  bioerodable  sustained release implant that delivers dexamethasone to the targeted disease site at the back of the eye 
phase clinical trials for posurdex have already been completed  and we intend to initiate phase clinical trials for posurdex in 
table of contents early the phase clinical trials will focus on macular edema associated with diabetes and other conditions 
in  we expect to incur approximately million to million in incremental research and development costs and other pre marketing and pre launch costs associated with the acquired posurdex technology 
additionally  we determined that the assets acquired also included a proprietary technology drug delivery platform which had alternative future uses in its current state  which we separately valued and capitalized as core technology 
the core technology is a versatile bioerodable polymer drug delivery technology which can be used for sustained local delivery of compounds to the eye 
see note  acquisitions  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a discussion of the acquisition of oculex 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
a summary of the net assets acquired follows in millions current assets property  plant and equipment capitalized intangible core technology straight line amortization over a year useful life in process research and development other non current assets  primarily deferred tax assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities bardeen sciences company  llc on may   we completed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of bardeen sciences company  llc from farallon pharma investors  llc for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs of million and million in certain intangible contract based product marketing and other rights  net of cash acquired 
we acquired all of bardeen s assets  which consisted of the rights to certain pharmaceutical compounds under development and research projects  including memantine  androgen tears  tazarotene in oral form for the treatment of acne  agn  agn  agn  a hypotensive lipid timolol combination  a photodynamic therapy project  tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of ocular neovascularization  a vision sparing project and a retinal disease project 
bardeen was formed in april upon our contribution of a portfolio of pharmaceutical compounds and research projects and the commitment of a million capital investment by farallon 
in return for our contribution of the portfolio  we received certain commercialization rights to market products developed from the compounds comprising the portfolio 
in addition  we acquired an option to purchase rights to any one product and a separate option to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of bardeen at an option price based on the amount of research and development funds expended by bardeen on the portfolio and the time elapsed since the effective date of the option agreement 
we acquired bardeen upon the exercise of our option to purchase all the outstanding equity interests of bardeen at the option price 
neither we nor any of our officers or directors owned any interest in bardeen or farallon prior to the acquisition of the outstanding interests 
we determined that the assets acquired consisted entirely of incomplete in process research and development assets and that these assets had no alternative future uses in their current state 

table of contents the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows in millions intangible assets in process research and development accounts payable from the time of bardeen s formation until the acquisition date  we performed research and development on the compounds comprising the portfolio on bardeen s behalf pursuant to a research and development services agreement between us and bardeen under which all such activities were fully funded by bardeen and services were performed on a cost plus basis 
because the financial risk associated with the research and development was transferred to bardeen  we recognized revenues and related costs as services were performed under such agreements as required under sfas no 
 research and development arrangements 
these amounts are included in research services revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million in research revenues  respectively  and million  million and million in research costs  respectively  under the research and development services agreement with bardeen 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for activities relating to foreign currency risk management 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
we have recorded current changes in the fair value of open foreign currency option contracts as unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments  net  and we have recorded the gains and losses realized from settled option contracts in other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging accounting criteria are met

table of contents adopted sfas no 
on january   however  we do not designate or account for our derivative foreign currency instruments as hedges 
we identified two types of derivative instruments at december   which were recorded as other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet at january   the date of adoption of sfas no 
the derivative instruments are foreign currency option contracts and foreign currency forward contracts 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 our management decided not to designate the foreign currency option and foreign currency forward contracts as accounting hedges 
accordingly  we recorded a net of tax cumulative effect loss of million into earnings to adjust the foreign currency option and forward contracts to fair value at january  interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents  interest expense on our debt as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt

we have also entered into contractual indemnity agreements with each of our directors and certain officers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify such directors and officers against any payments they are required to make as a result of a claim brought against such officer or director in such capacity  excluding claims i relating to the action or inaction of a director or officer that resulted in such director or officer gaining personal profit or advantage  ii for an accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale of our securities within the meaning of section b of the securities exchange act of or similar provisions of any state law or iii that are based upon or arise out of such director s or officer s knowingly fraudulent  deliberately dishonest or willful misconduct 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
however  we have purchased directors and officers liability insurance policies intended to reduce our monetary exposure and to enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we have not previously paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims as a result of these indemnification provisions 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal 
we customarily agree in the ordinary course of our business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trials investigators in our drug development programs  in sponsored research agreements with academic and not for profit institutions  in various comparable agreements involving parties performing services for us in the ordinary course of business  and in our real estate leases 
we also customarily agree to certain indemnification provisions in our drug discovery and development collaboration agreements 
with respect to our clinical trials and sponsored research agreements  these indemnification provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or the investigator s institution relating to personal injury or property damage  violations of law or certain breaches of our contractual obligations arising out of the research or clinical testing of our compounds or drug candidates 
with respect to lease agreements  the indemnification provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal injury or property damage caused by us  to violations of law by us or to certain breaches of our contractual obligations 
the indemnification provisions appearing in our collaboration agreements are similar  but in addition provide some limited indemnification for the collaborator in the event of third party claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
in each of the above cases  the term of these indemnification provisions generally survives the termination of the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these provisions is generally unlimited 
we have purchased insurance policies covering personal injury  property damage and general liability intended to reduce our exposure for indemnification and to enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we have not previously paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims as a result of these indemnification provisions 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal 
foreign currency risk overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales  gross margins or operating expenses as expressed in us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on our core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
the principal currencies subject to this process are the canadian dollar  mexican peso  australian dollar  brazilian real  euro and the japanese yen
