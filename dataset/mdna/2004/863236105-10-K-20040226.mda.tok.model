strayer university derives approximately of its revenue from tuition collected from its students 
the academic year of the university is divided into four quarters  which approximately coincide with the four quarters of the calendar year 
students make payment arrangements for the tuition for each course prior to the beginning of the quarter 
when students register for courses  tuition is recorded as unearned tuition  which is recognized as courses are taught through the academic quarter 
if a student withdraws from a course prior to completion  the university refunds a portion of the tuition depending on when the withdrawal occurs 
the university also derives revenue from various fees such as application fees  placement examination fees and no show fees related to students who fail to attend a course and do not officially withdraw 
interest earned on the company s student loan portfolio and income generated from the sale of its student loans are recorded as revenue 
strayer university records tuition receivable when students register for the academic quarter  generally prior to the end of the previous academic quarter 
because the university s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters  tuition receivable at the end of any calendar quarter largely represents student tuition due for the following academic quarter 
based upon past experience and judgment  the university establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable not included in unearned tuition 
any uncollected account more than six months past due for students who have left the university is charged against the allowance 
our bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
strayer university s expenses consist of instruction and educational support expenses  selling and promotion expenses  and general and administration expenses 
instruction and educational support expenses generally contain items of expense directly attributable to the educational activity of the university 
this expense category includes salaries and benefits of faculty and academic administrators 
instruction and educational support expenses also include costs of educational supplies and facilities  including rent on campus leases  certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories and all other physical plant and occupancy costs  with the exception of costs attributable to the corporate offices 
selling and promotion expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in recruitment  admissions  promotion and development  as well as costs of advertising and production of marketing materials 
general and administration expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in management  student services  accounting  human resources  compliance and other corporate functions  along with the occupancy costs attributable to such functions 
investment and other income consists primarily of earnings and realized gains or losses on investments 
commissions earned from third party bookstore sales are also recorded on this line item 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments related to its allowance for uncollectible accounts  reserves for student loan losses and for indemnifications related to student loans sold  income tax provisions  valuation of deferred tax assets  and accrued expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
tuition income is deferred at the time of registration and is recognized as income  net of any refunds or withdrawals  throughout each respective quarter session 
advance registrations for the next quarter are recorded as unearned tuition 
we record estimates for our allowance for uncollectible accounts for tuition receivable from students  for loan loss reserves from student loans granted and for indemnifications to third party purchaser of student loans 
if the financial condition of our students were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make required payments for tuition or loans payable to us  additional allowances and loan reserves may be required 
if the company s obligations under the indemnifications provided to third party purchaser of student loans exceed management s estimates  additional reserves may be required 
we record estimates for our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities may be required

new campuses the company s goal is to open new campuses every year with five new campuses planned for the company s objective is to ultimately be a nationwide university 
a new campus typically requires up to million in upfront capital costs for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computer equipment 
in the first year of operation  assuming a midyear opening  the company expects to incur operating losses of about million including depreciation related to capital costs described above 
a new campus is expected to begin generating operating income on a quarterly basis after quarters of operation  generally upon reaching an enrollment level of about students 
the company s new campus notional model assumes an increase of average enrollment by students per year until reaching a level of about  students 
given the potential return on investment achieved with each new campus an estimated  opening new campuses is an important part of the company s strategy 
the company believes it has sufficient capital resources from cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operating activities to continue to open new campuses for at least the next months 
in  the company opened five new campuses two in tennessee memphis and nashville for the spring term  a second campus in raleigh  north carolina for the summer term  and two in philadelphia  pennsylvania for the fall term 
tennessee and pennsylvania represent new states for the company 
in the prior year  the company opened three new campuses  all in north carolina two of the campuses in charlotte and one in the raleigh durham area 
in  the company has opened two new campuses for spring term enrollment one in greenville  south carolina and one in memphis  tennessee  its second one there 
in addition  two campuses are planned for atlanta  georgia and another one in a state where it currently has a campus 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  enrollment 
average enrollment increased from  students for the year ended december  to  students for the same period in this growth is principally due to new campus openings  stable growth in our mature markets  and the rapid growth in markets outside of commuting distance to a strayer university physical campus served by strayer university online 
revenues 
revenues increased from million in to million in principally due to a increase in the average enrollment and a tuition increase in also contributing to the increase was the gain on the sale of the company s student loan portfolio which increased revenue by million 
instruction and educational support expenses 
instruction and educational support expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was principally due to direct costs necessary to support the increase in student enrollments including faculty compensation  related academic staff salaries  campus facility costs and financial aid processing costs 
these costs as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in largely attributable to the increase in new campus openings to five in compared to three in selling and promotion expenses 
selling and promotion expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was principally due to the direct costs required to generate leads for enrollment growth 
the addition of admissions officers  particularly at new campuses and at strayer university online  also contributed to the increase 
these expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in largely attributable to the increase in new campus openings to five in compared to three in new campus openings require disproportionately higher marketing expenses in the first few years of operation compared to older campuses 
general and administration expenses 
general and administration expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was principally due to increased employee compensation and related expenses  the addition of five new campuses in  and higher bad debt expense related to higher revenues 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in primarily due to greater revenues being spread over the largely fixed costs of various centralized functions 
gain on sale of asset 
in the third quarter of  the company sold its washington  dc campus building for million million net of selling expenses and signed a lease for space in a nearby building 
this transaction resulted in a gain of million before tax 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  from million in to million in due to the aforementioned factors 
investment and other income 
investment and other income increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was principally due to a higher average cash balance  a higher average level of investments in marketable securities  and a million gain before tax on the sale of marketable securities  partly offset by lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
income tax expense increased million  or  from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in income before taxes attributable to the factors discussed above 
this was partly offset by a lower effective tax rate of in  compared to in  resulting primarily from investments in tax exempt securities 
net income 
net income increased million  or  from million in to million in because of the factors discussed above 
the company s financial results for the year ended december  are set forth in the financial statements below and presented in accordance with gaap 
as required by gaap  these results include the positive impact of the previously announced sale of the company s student loan portfolio in the fourth quarter as well as the gain on the sale of the washington  dc campus building in the third quarter of these transactions increased revenue by million  operating income by million  net income by million and earnings per diluted share by 
since the company believes that the impact of these transactions is not necessarily recurring nor indicative of the company s underlying performance  the table below sets forth the impact of excluding them from the company s financial results 
secondary offering costs of million incurred in the fourth quarter of are also excluded for the same reason

liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million at december  beginning in the second quarter of  we began investing in a diversified no load  short term  investment grade corporate bond fund in an effort to generate a somewhat higher yield on our short term  liquid assets than our holdings in bank overnight deposits and money market funds  but taking only limited credit and interest rate risk 
in the third quarter of  this million investment was liquidated generating a gain from sale of marketable securities of million before tax 
most of the proceeds were re invested in a diversified  shorter term  investment grade tax exempt bond fund to further reduce the company s interest rate risk and to benefit from the tax efficiency of the fund s underlying securities
