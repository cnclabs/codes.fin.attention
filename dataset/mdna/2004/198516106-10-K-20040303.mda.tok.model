item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources  including known trends and uncertainties identified by management  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
all references to years relate to the calendar year ended december of the particular year 
overview since our initial public offering in  our net sales have steadily increased from million in to million in  which equates to a compound annual growth rate of for this period 
although we cannot predict with certainty any results on a prospective basis  we remain optimistic that we will continue to benefit from global market opportunities for each of our key product categories 
to capitalize on these opportunities  we are committed to our four pronged growth strategy of enhancing the retail productivity of our customers  leveraging the columbia brand in international markets  further developing our existing merchandise categories and selectively broadening our retail distribution 
with our well developed sourcing and distribution infrastructure  coupled with a proven design and product development team  we believe that we are well positioned for future growth 
for the year ended december   we achieved sales growth in each of our product categories 
for the first time in our history  annual sales from outerwear represented less than of total sales  reflecting sales growth in our footwear and sportswear categories 
sales growth was also realized in each major geographical area in which we operate 
our success during was largely the result of increased international sales  particularly in europe and in our international distributor based markets 
our success internationally was enhanced by favorable foreign currency exchange rates in our direct markets as many foreign currencies strengthened in relation to the us dollar 
although changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected our sales and earnings growth in  we believe our intrinsic growth is the result of well developed products  exceptional sourcing capabilities and strategically focused promotional activities 
as part of our growth strategy to provide a head to toe product offering  we have expanded our product line from our traditional outerwear category to other products including sportswear and footwear 
we continue to experience a shift in our sales product mix from our outerwear category to our footwear and sportswear product categories 
although sales growth has been achieved in all product categories  sales growth in the footwear and sportswear categories has outpaced outerwear sales growth 
due to the shift in our sales product mix  our gross margin has experienced some erosion because outerwear products typically sell at higher gross margins than other product offerings 
during  the erosion in margin due to the shift in sales product mix was offset by the favorable effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
in  we anticipate some margin contraction due to the continued shift in sales product mix  since we expect sales from footwear and sportswear to continue to grow faster than outerwear sales 
for  our footwear and sportswear product sales grew and  respectively  compared to  which is attributable to our existing and improved product offerings and overall product acceptance by our customers both in the united states and abroad 
the outerwear product category was also successful internationally  with sales growth in europe  canada and other international markets 
in the united states  outerwear sales declined due to the relative maturity of the outerwear market domestically 
the challenges in the domestic outerwear market include changes in youth fashion trends 
in  our design emphasis will focus more intently on youth trends and the product line will have greater differentiation 
table of contents between boys and girls products  as well as greater clarification between products for young children and pre teens 
the updated youth outerwear line will offer new products at better value for the consumer  with input from our retailers to enhance the line 
we opened a european distribution center in cambrai  france in to support our international growth 
the distribution center operated effectively in each of our two major shipping seasons during its first year of operation 
as a result of the growth of our footwear product category  and to reduce domestic shipping costs for our footwear products  we are constructing a new domestic distribution center in kentucky that we expect to commence operations in results of operations net income increased million  or  to million for from million for fully diluted earnings per share increased to for from for net income increased million  or  to million for from million for fully diluted earnings per share increased to for from for the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship to net sales of specified items in our consolidated statements of operations net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative net licensing income income from operations interest income expense  net income before income tax income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales consolidated net sales increased to million in from million in our net sales growth was predominantly driven by the expansion of our international business  particularly our european business  followed by our other international and canadian businesses 
sales growth was attributable to an increase in unit sales volume across all geographic markets and product categories 
moreover  net sales growth was achieved in each of our product categories  in both dollars and unit volumes  led by sportswear and followed by footwear  outerwear  accessories and equipment 
in  we continued to experience a shift in our sales product mix as sales of sportswear and footwear grew faster than outerwear and accessories

as a percentage of net sales  net sales from accessories decreased slightly from of net sales in to of net sales in with our acquisition of mountain hardwear  we have a new product category  equipment  which represented of our net sales 
net sales from outerwear increased million  or  to million in from million in sales of outerwear decelerated in the united states due to the relative maturity of the outerwear product

net sales from accessories increased million  or  to million in from million in all major markets experienced strong accessory shipments during net sales from equipment  a new product category resulting from our acquisition of mountain hardwear  represented million of our total net sales during the equipment product category consists primarily of tents and sleeping bags 
net sales in the united states increased million  or  to million in from million in net sales growth in the united states constituted of the increase in consolidated net sales 
excluding mountain hardwear  domestic net sales increased 
the increase in domestic net sales was the result of increased sales from sportswear and footwear partially offset by decreases in the outerwear category

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to in from in a shift in product mix from our traditional outerwear products to sportswear and footwear had an unfavorable impact on gross margin  but was offset by the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
in general  our outerwear products carry higher gross margins followed by our accessories  sportswear and footwear products 
in  outerwear sales represented of net sales compared to of net sales 
conversely  sportswear and footwear sales represented and of net sales in compared to and of net sales in  respectively 
in the future  we anticipate the shift in product sales mix will continue to exert pressure on our gross margins 
in  our improved gross margins were largely attributable to favorable sourcing costs 
although we continue to benefit from our sourcing efforts  in relative terms  sourcing costs did not materially impact our gross margins in the results of recording the mountain hardwear inventory at fair value in purchase accounting had an unfavorable impact on our gross margins of approximately percentage point 
most of the inventory that mountain hardwear had on hand as of the acquisition date  march   was sold during accordingly  the remaining mark to market adjustments will not have a material impact on our consolidated gross margin in the future 

table of contents our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities  because some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 
some companies such as ours  however  have chosen to include these expenses as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a includes all costs associated with our design  marketing  distribution and corporate functions including depreciation and amortization 
our annual report for the year ended december  and prior years included net licensing income as an offset to sg a expense 
for the purposes of our annual report for the year ended december   net licensing income is presented as a separate line item in our consolidated statement of operations for each year presented 
sg a increased million  or  to million in from million in excluding changes in currency exchange rates  sg a increased million  or 
the increase in sg a expense was primarily the result of an increase in variable selling expenses  including commissions and advertising expense  and operating expenses to support the higher level of sales 
the increase in advertising expense was primarily the result of our key growth initiatives to enhance channel productivity through the expansion of in store concept shops and brand enhancement systems 
during  we made significant investments installing these point of purchase displays at many of our retailers globally 
the increased selling expenses is also partially attributable to a promotional agreement we entered into with jeep for the introduction of new limited production columbia edition jeep vehicles  to provide broad brand exposure for columbia in the united states and canada 
through the program  we received national media exposure expanding columbia brand awareness 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel related costs and depreciation expense 
the increase in personnel costs was due to an expansion of our product offerings and to support the higher level of sales and anticipated sales growth 
depreciation and amortization totaled million for compared to million for the increase was primarily related to our european distribution center  which was placed in service in january as a percentage of net sales  sg a was in each of and we expect that our initiatives to continue our global expansion and product category growth will result in sg a expense being at a comparable level to in relative terms 
net licensing income as our licensees have gained momentum in the market place with the sale of our branded products  our licensing arrangements have produced highly profitable income for the company 
although net licensing income is not a significant income driver as mentioned above  beginning in net licensing income was presented as a separate line item in our consolidated statement of operations for all years presented  whereas it historically had been presented as an offset to sg a expense 
net licensing income is derived from income that we earn through licensing our trademark across a range of categories that complement our current product offerings 
at december   we had signed thirteen licensing agreements for products that include socks  bags  packs  leather outerwear  eyewear  watches and other accessories 
net licensing income increased million  or  to million in from million in interest income expense  net interest income was million in compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in interest income was due to the lower interest rate environment and the relative mix of taxable and tax exempt investment securities compared to the same period in 
table of contents interest expense was million in compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in interest expense was attributable to the repayment of short term notes payable and long term debt 
income tax expense the provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the reduction in the effective tax rate from to is primarily due to a reduction in accrued income taxes related to favorable outcomes of various federal  state and international income tax audits during the year 
in  we anticipate further reductions in our effective tax rate due to several factors  including an increase in the relative mix of international and consolidated profitability  as our growth rates internationally exceed our domestic growth rates and reductions in our overall state income tax expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales consolidated net sales increased to million in from million for our net sales growth was predominantly driven by the expansion of our international business  particularly in europe  followed by our international distributor and canadian businesses 
the growth of our business in the united states has been slower than our international growth primarily due to the relative maturity of our outerwear product category and economic conditions in the united states coupled with the warm climate experienced in the united states during increased unit sales volume was the primary reason for the increase in net sales across all geographic markets 
in particular  the increase in net sales in was primarily attributable to increased unit shipments of sportswear and outerwear and to a lesser degree increased unit shipments of footwear and accessories 
outerwear net sales increased to million in from million for one of the key drivers for the increased net sales of outerwear was the expansion of our business and the acceptance of our products in international markets 
to a lesser degree  the introduction of new product styles also contributed to increased sales of outerwear units 
sportswear net sales increased to million in from million for similar to our outerwear net sales growth  the increase in net sales of sportswear was largely attributable to an increase in unit shipments from the expansion of our business internationally 
footwear net sales increased to million in from million for although the shipment of footwear units increased in europe and other international markets  the shipment of us footwear units were off in due to a highly competitive retail market and difficult economic conditions in the us as well as a transitional footwear product offering 
net sales of accessories increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of increased unit shipments of hats and gloves 
net sales in the united states increased to million in from million for the million increase in net sales was attributable to increased unit shipments of outerwear  sportswear and accessories partially offset by a decrease in footwear unit shipments 
european direct sales increased to million in from million for the million increase in net sales was attributable to increased unit shipments in all product categories 
outerwear led the increase in net sales growth followed by sportswear  footwear and accessories 
the increase in european direct sales was primarily attributable to higher sales with existing customers coupled with an increase in the number of retailers we sell to in europe 
canadian sales increased to million in from million for the million increase in net sales was attributable to increased unit shipments in all product categories 
outerwear led the increase in net sales growth followed by footwear and accessories partially offset by a decrease in sportswear net sales 
net other international sales  excluding canadian and european direct sales  increased to million in from million for the million increase in net sales was attributable to increased unit shipments in all product categories  led by outerwear and followed by sportswear  footwear and accessories 

table of contents excluding the effects of exchange rates  canadian sales increased  european direct sales increased and net other international sales  excluding canadian sales and european direct sales  increased in compared to gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared to for  an improvement of percentage points 
after adjusting our gross margin for the effects of the weaker euro us dollar and canadian dollar us dollar currency hedge rates in compared to  our gross margin improvement for was approximately percentage points 
foreign currency hedge rates had an unfavorable effect on our gross margins of approximately percentage points 
this decrease was more than offset by favorable sourcing costs  which was the primary factor driving the improved gross margin for to a lesser degree  effective inventory management and favorable weather conditions in the northeastern us allowed for the timely shipping of full priced fall products and improved margins on off price selling activities 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense increased to million in from million for the increase in sg a expense was primarily the result of an increase in variable selling and operating expenses to support the higher level of sales 
more specifically  variable selling expenses  including commissions and advertising expense  increased due to the increase in net sales in the increase in these variable selling expenses was more than offset by reductions in discretionary marketing programs  resulting in a decrease in total selling expenses for an increase in general and administrative expenses more than offset the decrease in total selling expenses due to increased personnel and depreciation expense 
the increase in personnel expenses was due to an expansion of the company s product offerings and to support the higher level of sales 
the increase in depreciation expense was attributable to expanding the capacity of our us distribution center and moving our corporate headquarters to a larger facility capable of handling our growth 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expense decreased to in from for the decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of continued operating efficiencies from global infrastructure investments and effective cost control measures  which enabled us to leverage several sg a expenses including commissions  discretionary marketing programs  and personnel related costs 
net licensing income net licensing income increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in net licensing income was due to an increase in the sale of packs  belts and personal leather goods and other newly added licensed products  including watches and leather outerwear 
interest income expense  net interest income was million in compared to million for and interest expense was million in compared to million for these changes for were attributable to an increase in cash compared to and repayments of short term notes payable 
income tax expense the provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the effective tax rate was for and for the reduction in the effective tax rate was due to several factors  including the relative mix of international and domestic profitability and  to a lesser degree  the utilization of foreign tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing funding requirements are to finance working capital and the continued growth of the business 
we financed our operations for the year ended december  primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was largely due to an increase in inventories to support higher sales levels for spring  and an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the latter part of and appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
the increase in net income partially offset the increases in inventory and accounts receivable 

table of contents our primary capital requirements are for working capital  investing activities associated with the expansion of our global operations and general corporate needs 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million for the comparable period in in  our investing activities included million for the acquisition of mountain hardwear  net of cash acquired  and million for capital expenditures including approximately million related to the initial phase of construction of a distribution center in henderson county  kentucky 
cash used in financing activities was million in and million for the comparable period in in  net cash used in financing activities was primarily for the net repayment of notes payable of million  the repayment of mountain hardwear s debt of million  and the repayment of the company s long term debt of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under employee stock plans of million 
in  net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to net repayment of borrowings on short term notes payable of million and net repayment of million on long term debt  offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under employee stock plans of million 
to fund our domestic working capital requirements  we have available unsecured revolving lines of credit with aggregate seasonal limits ranging from million to million  of which million to million is committed 
as of december   no domestic balance was outstanding under these lines of credit 
internationally  our subsidiaries have local currency operating lines in place guaranteed by us with a combined limit of approximately million at december  there were no balances outstanding under these lines of credit at december  additionally  we maintain unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit with a combined limit of million at december   available for issuing letters of credit 
at december   the balance outstanding under these letters of credit was million 
as we continue our investment in global infrastructure to support our growth  we anticipate that capital expenditures for will total approximately million  consisting of maintenance capital requirements and information technology and distribution projects 
in  we broke ground on the construction of a distribution center in henderson county  kentucky primarily for the purpose of distributing footwear products 
this distribution center is expected to consist of approximately  square feet  cost an estimated million to construct  and begin shipping products in as of december   capital expenditures for the kentucky distribution center totaled approximately million 
although the kentucky distribution center will be constructed primarily to support our footwear products  it will be designed and engineered to support other product lines as well 
the facility will improve our proximity to major footwear customers and  we believe  will facilitate reorders 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures with existing cash and cash provided by operations 
if the need arises for additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional credit facilities will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
we do not assure you that financing will be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  and have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third calendar quarter 
this pattern has resulted primarily from the timing of shipments to wholesale customers for the fall outerwear season 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements 

table of contents the following table presents our estimated contractual commitments in thousands year ending december  thereafter total debt repayments operating leases non related parties related parties these operating lease commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as a result of our international sales  production and funding requirements 
our policy is to use financial instruments to reduce market risk where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed 
foreign currency and interest rate transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from production purchases  intercompany transactions and other costs from exchange rate movements 
we manage this risk by using forward exchange contracts and purchased options to hedge various firm as well as anticipated commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed  transactions that we hedge carry a high level of certainty and are expected to be recognized within one year 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
the fair value of our hedging contracts was unfavorable by million at december  and december  a change in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately million at december  and million at december  changes in fair value  resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have no exposure due to interest rate changes on our million and million of long term debt as of december  and  respectively 
we do  however  have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit because interest on those lines floats and is based on libor and other interest rate indices 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
table of contents under the circumstances 
some of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and inventory obsolescence 
management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates and the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the disclosure about each estimate in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
revenue recognition we record wholesale and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some countries outside of the us  predominantly where we sell directly in western europe  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based on historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
we periodically test the accuracy of these estimates based on actual transactions 
delivery times vary by geographic location  generally from one to four days 
to date  we have found these estimates to be materially accurate 
upon shipment  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims that have ranged from approximately one to two percent of sales 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves that had been established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such a determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates for the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the credit worthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance could be required 
if we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to sg a expense in the period in which we made the determination 
inventory obsolescence and product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future excess  close out or slow moving inventory and product warranty costs 
we identify our excess inventory  a component of which is planned  and evaluate our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value 
when evaluating our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our historical returns rates by season  product mix  current economic trends  and the historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original 
table of contents sale 
if we determine smaller or larger reserves were appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period we made the determination 
income taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we make ongoing estimates in determining the valuation allowance for the net deferred tax asset in order to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
although we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we have different judgments or use different estimates in the future  these differences may affect the valuation allowance and  accordingly  income in the period we made the determination 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated effective rate 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

forward looking statements this annual report  including item of part i and items and a of part ii  contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include any statements related to our expectations regarding future performance or conditions  including any statements regarding potential sales growth in domestic and international markets  sales growth in merchandise categories  increased sales to department stores and footwear specialty shops  implementation and performance of new management information systems and distribution facilities  access to raw materials and factory capacity  and financing and working capital requirements and resources 
these forward looking statements  and others we make from time to time  are subject to many risks and uncertainties 
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements  including the risks described below under the heading factors that may affect our business and the price of our common stock 
risk factors that may affect our business and liquidity  future financing and working capital requirements and availability include international risks  including trade disruptions  political instability in foreign markets  exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in quotas and tariffs or other duties  unfavorable economic conditions generally and weakness in consumer confidence  the financial health of our customers  our ability to fully and cost effectively integrate mountain hardwear into our existing operations  our ability to effectively deliver products to customers in a timely manner despite potential service interruptions  effects of unseasonable weather including  for example  warm weather in the winter and cold weather in the spring  each of which affects demand for our products  our reliance on product acceptance by consumers  our dependence on independent manufacturers and suppliers  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  intense competition in the industry which we expect to increase  our ability to achieve and manage growth effectively  business disruptions and costs arising from disease outbreak  acts of terrorism  or military activities around the globe  
table of contents our ability to effectively implement and expand our distribution facilities  the availability of labor  raw materials and other resources on favorable terms  and our ability to establish and protect our intellectual property 
we do not undertake any duty to update forward looking statements after the date they are made or to conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations 
factors that may affect our business and the price of our common stock our business is affected by weather conditions our business is adversely affected by unseasonal weather conditions 
sales of our outerwear and cold weather footwear are dependent in part on the weather and may decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of such products 
for example  in prior years we believe unseasonably warm weather in the united states caused customers to delay  and in some cases reduce or cancel  orders for our outerwear  which had an adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or unseasonably cold or wet weather in the spring could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our sales and earnings may be adversely affected by an economic downturn or economic uncertainty sales of our products are subject to substantial cyclical fluctuation 
consumer demand for our apparel and footwear  or our licensed products  may not reach our growth targets  or may decline  when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets  particularly markets in north america and europe 
continuing weakness in the japanese economy  for example  has limited growth opportunities in recent years  and a slower economy in the united states in and has created additional uncertainties for our customers and our business 
in addition  continued volatility in the global oil markets has resulted in rising fuel prices  which many shipping companies are passing on to their customers 
our shipping costs have continued to increase over the past several years  and we expect these increases to continue 
because we price our products to our customers in advance  we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers 
our sensitivity to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in consumer demand and rising shipping costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our international operations involve many risks we are subject to many risks generally associated with doing business abroad  including foreign governmental regulations  foreign consumer preferences  political unrest  disruptions or delays in shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products 
in addition  disease outbreaks  terrorist acts and us military operations abroad have increased the risks of doing business abroad 
these factors  among others  could affect our ability to sell products in international markets  our ability to manufacture products or procure materials  and our cost of doing business 
if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
the countries in which our products are produced or sold may adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we produce a significant portion of our products in china and vietnam  and therefore adverse conditions in either country or adverse changes in that country s trading status with the united states or with other sales markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we are affected by the financial health of retailers we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer s financial circumstances  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products  we offer customers discounts for placing pre season orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before the peak shipping season 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectible receivables 
in addition  we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty 
some of our significant customers have experienced financial difficulties in the past  which in turn have had an adverse effect on our business  and we believe that retailers are being more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy 
a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in very competitive markets the markets for outerwear  sportswear  rugged footwear  tents and sleeping bags are highly competitive  as are the markets for our licensed products 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from global and regional branded apparel and footwear companies 
in many instances  retailers who are our customers pose our most significant competitive threat by marketing apparel  footwear and equipment under their own labels 
we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 
many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources and have achieved greater recognition for their products than we have 
increased competition could result in reductions in display areas in retail locations  reductions in sales or reductions in prices of our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with consumer preferences and fashion trends changes in consumer preferences or consumer interest in outdoor activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  although we believe that our products have not been significantly affected by past fashion trends  changes in fashion trends could have a greater impact as we expand our offerings to include more product categories in more geographic areas 
also  we face risks because our business requires us to anticipate consumer preferences 
our decisions about product designs often are made far in advance of consumer acceptance 
although we try to manage our inventory risk through early order commitments by retailers  we must generally place production orders with manufacturers before we have received all of a season s orders 
if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences  we could experience lower sales  excess inventories and lower profit margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our use of proprietary rights our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products 
we also place significant value on our trade dress  the overall appearance and image of our products 
from time to time  we discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or design knock offs 
if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party s products on the basis of trademark or design infringement  continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
additionally  in markets outside of the united states  it may be more difficult for us to establish our proprietary rights and to challenge successfully use of those rights by other parties 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark and trade dress disputes  as we extend our brand into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we could 
table of contents become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
future litigation also may be necessary to defend us against such claims or to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
any intellectual property litigation could be costly and could cause diversion of management s attention from the operation of our business 
adverse determinations in any litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our distribution facilities and systems our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory  complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our existing distribution facilities  the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities 
in the united states  we rely primarily on our distribution center in portland  oregon  in canada  we rely primarily on our distribution center in strathoy  ontario  and in europe we distribute our products through our distribution center in cambrai  france 
the implementation and performance of any new distribution facility is subject to many risks generally associated with transition and startup activities  including the risk that the new distribution facility may not successfully handle distribution activities 
our distribution facilities in the united states and france are highly automated  which means their operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to computer viruses  the proper operation of software and hardware  electronic or power interruptions  or other system failures 
our operations could also be interrupted by disasters  such as earthquakes which are known to occur in the northwestern united states or fires 
we maintain business interruption insurance  but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effect that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 
we have begun construction of a new distribution center in henderson county  kentucky  which we will own and operate 
we anticipate that the new facility will be operational in our ability to complete a new facility is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including our ability to construct and integrate a new facility with existing operations in a timely manner  the availability of labor  raw materials and other inputs on anticipated terms and our ability to obtain any necessary governmental approvals 
we may not be able to implement our growth strategy or manage growth successfully we face many challenges in implementing our growth strategies 
for example  our expansion into international markets involves countries where we have little sales or distribution experience and where our brand is not yet widely known 
expanding our product categories involves  among other things  gaining experience with new products  gaining consumer acceptance  and establishing and protecting intellectual property rights 
increasing sales to department stores  and improving the sales productivity of our customers  will each depend on various factors  including strength of our brand name  competitive conditions  our ability to manage increased sales and future expansion  the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of terms with retailers 
future terms with customers may be less favorable to us than those under which we now operate 
large retailers in particular increasingly seek to transfer various costs of business to their vendors  such as the cost of lost profits from product price markdowns 
to implement our business strategy  we need to manage growth effectively 
we need to continue to change various aspects of our business  to maintain and enhance our information systems and operations to respond to increased demand and to attract  retain and manage qualified personnel 
growth could place an increasing strain on management  financial  product design  marketing  distribution and other resources  and we could experience operating difficulties 
for example  in recent years  we have undertaken a number of new initiatives that require significant management attention and corporate resources  including the development or expansion of distribution facilities on two continents  the acquisition  rejuvenation and extension of the sorel brand  and the acquisition and integration of mountain hardwear  inc this growth involves many risks and uncertainties and  if we are unable to manage them effectively  we may not achieve our objectives  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our business we generally purchase products in us dollars 
however  the cost of these products sourced overseas may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins 
our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies  and these revenues and expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations  including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 
foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
labor disruptions at ports may adversely affect our business our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
as a result  we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide  particularly in the western united states 
labor disputes at various ports  such as those experienced at western us ports in  create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak importing seasons  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
we depend on independent manufacturers to make our products and meet customer expectations our products are produced by independent manufacturers worldwide 
we do not operate or own any production facilities 
although we enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season  we do not have long term contracts with some manufacturers 
we therefore face risks that manufacturing operations will fail to perform as expected or that our competitors will gain production or quota capacities that we need for our business 
if a manufacturer fails to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards  we could miss delivery requirements  which could result in cancellation of orders  refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in an effort to ensure that our independent manufacturers operate with safe  ethical and humane working conditions  we regularly monitor factories and we enforce our requirements that each manufacturer agree to comply with our standards of manufacturing practices and applicable laws and regulations  but we do not control these vendors or their labor practices 
if a manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or engages in practices that are not generally accepted as ethical in our key markets  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on key suppliers for some specialty fabrics some of the materials that we use may be available  in the short term  from only one source or a very limited number of sources 
for example  some specialty fabrics are manufactured to our specification by one source or a few sources 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty satisfying our raw material and finished goods requirements 
although we believe that we could identify and qualify additional factories to produce these materials  the unavailability of some existing manufacturers for supply of these materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our advance purchases of products may result in excess inventories to minimize our purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery  we place orders for our products with manufacturers prior to receiving all of our customers orders and maintain an inventory of various products that we anticipate will be in greater demand 
we may not be able to sell the 
table of contents products we have ordered from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory 
customers are allowed to cancel an order prior to shipment with sufficient advance notice 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on key personnel our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel  particularly timothy boyle  our president and chief executive officer  and gertrude boyle  our chairman and widely recognized advertising spokesperson 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers  designers  sales people and others 
we face intense competition for such individuals worldwide  and there is a significant concentration of well funded apparel and footwear competitors in and around portland  oregon including nike and adidas salomon 
we may not be able to attract or retain these employees  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is affected by seasonality and fluctuations in operating results our results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our products are marketed on a seasonal basis  with a product mix now weighted substantially toward the fall season 
our results of operations for the quarter ended september in the past have been much stronger than the results for the other quarters 
this seasonality  along with other factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  changes in consumer behavior  weather conditions  availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations  could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
we face risks of product liability and warranty claims our products are used in outdoor activities  sometimes in severe conditions 
although we have not experienced any significant expense as the result of product recalls or product liability claims  recalls or these types of claims could occur in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business 
some of our outerwear and sorel products carry limited warranties for defects in quality and workmanship 
we maintain a warranty reserve for future warranty claims  but the actual costs of servicing future warranty claims could exceed the reserve and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our common stock price may be volatile the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market  which has experienced and is likely to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
we also believe factors such as fluctuations in financial results  variances from financial market expectations  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or announcements by us or competitors may cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
insiders control a majority of our common stock and could sell shares timothy boyle  gertrude boyle and sarah bany gertrude boyle s daughter and a member of our board of directors  beneficially own a majority of our common stock 
as a result  if acting together  they are able to effectively control matters requiring shareholder approval without the cooperation of other shareholders 
shares held by these three insiders are available for resale  subject to the requirements of  and the rules under the securities act of the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock
