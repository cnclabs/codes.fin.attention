item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global semiconductor provider of high performance analog  mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits 
our diverse product portfolio includes switching  transceiver  wireless pc connectivity  gateways  communications controller  and storage and power management solutions that serve diverse applications used in business enterprise  consumer electronics and emerging markets 
we were founded in we are a fabless integrated circuit company  which means that we rely on independent  third party contractors to perform manufacturing  assembly and test functions 
this approach allows us to focus on designing  developing and marketing our products and significantly reduces the amount of capital we 
table of contents need to invest in manufacturing products 
in january  we acquired galileo technology ltd 
now marvell semiconductor israel ltd  or msil in a stock for stock transaction for aggregate consideration of approximately billion 
msil develops high performance internetworking and switching products for the broadband communications market 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the operating results of msil have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in june  we acquired radlan computer communications ltd 
radlan  a leading provider of embedded networking software  for aggregate consideration to date of approximately million 
we offer our customers a wide range of high performance analog  mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits 
our customers for our read channel devices  storage socs  preamplifiers  motor controllers and serial ata products are manufacturers of hard disk drives for the enterprise  desktop and mobile computing markets and the emerging consumer applications market 
we sell our communications physical layer transceivers  switches and controllers to manufacturers of high speed networking equipment and pcs 
our target customers for our wlan products include manufacturers of wlan solutions for soho and residential gateway solutions as well as manufacturers of a variety of new emerging consumer applications such as cellular handsets  gaming devices  pdas  and emerging home entertainment multimedia client devices 
our target customers for our power management solutions are very broad and includes manufacturers of many diverse electronic devices 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to our five largest customers  two of which accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to five significant customers  each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period  and in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to four significant customers 
also  in fiscal and  one distributor accounted for and of our total revenues  respectively 
we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
in addition  a significant portion of our sales are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
sales to customers in asia represented approximately  and of our net revenue for the years ended january   and  respectively 
because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors for our served markets are located in asia  we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be represented by sales to customers in that region 
substantially all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  which may cause us to experience a delay between the time we incur expenses and the time revenue is generated from these expenditures 
we expect to increase our research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenditures as we seek to expand our operations 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and future quarters may be adversely affected 
our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the saturday closest to january in a week year  each fiscal quarter consists of weeks 
the additional week in a week year is added to the fourth quarter  making such quarter consist of weeks 
fiscal years and were comprised of weeks 
fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
for presentation purposes  our financial statements and notes and this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to january as our year end 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
table of contents assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
however  some of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and rights of return on product unsold by the distributors 
product revenue on sales made through distributors with rights of return is deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers 
additionally  collection is not deemed to be reasonably assured if customers receive extended payment terms 
as a result  revenue on sales to customers with payment terms substantially greater than our normal payment terms is deferred and is recognized as revenue as the payments become due 
at january   revenue of million with an associated gross profit of million was deferred 
at january   revenue of million with an associated gross profit of million was deferred 
our provision for estimated price protection  sales returns and allowances on product sales is recorded in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if actual price protection granted to distributors or product returns exceeds our estimates  additional reductions of revenue would result 
our total allowance for sales returns was million and million as of january  and  respectively 
actual future returns could be different than the returns allowance established 
we also enter into development agreements with some of our customers 
development revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method  with the associated costs included in research and development expense 
we estimate the percentage of completion of our development contracts based on an analysis of progress toward completion  which is measured using input measures such as the percentage of completion 
accounting for income taxes 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets as of january   due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulation and court rulings 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and or our effective income tax rate 
we recorded a tax provision of million in the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
on august   the internal revenue service irs began an income tax audit for the fiscal years ended january   and we believe the ultimate resolution of the irs audit will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable reserves 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the realization of our accounts receivable and our results of operations 
inventory reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we are also required to perform annual assessments of goodwill impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and v a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between net book values of the asset and its estimated fair value 
the annual impairment test required under sfas was completed and did not identify any impairment of goodwill 
we will continue to perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
litigation costs 
from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there can be no assurance these actions or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future  which may adversely impact gross margins 
we are aggressively 
table of contents defending these litigation matters and believe no material adverse outcome will result 
however  given uncertainties associated with any litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments at january  is million

net revenue is gross revenue  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
the increases in net revenue reflect a significant increase in volume shipments of our storage and gigabit ethernet products during the fiscal year ended january   primarily due to increased acceptance of our storage soc products by hard disk drive manufacturers  increased market share gains in the desktop segment with our read channel and storage soc products  the continued adoption of our gigabit ethernet products as a replacement for fast 
table of contents ethernet products  and volume shipments of wlan products 
revenue from storage products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue from communications products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue derived from development contracts increased in fiscal  but represented less than of net revenues for each year and decreased as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect that revenue for fiscal will increase from the level of revenue we reported in fiscal due to increases in shipments and volume production of our storage socs into desktop design wins and increased adoption of our storage products into emerging consumer storage electronics 
also  we expect additional growth in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in shipments of our wlan products from new design wins and our gigabit ethernet products for switching equipment 
a portion of our revenue is concentrated with a relatively small number of customers  particularly for storage applications  where sales to customers in the hard disk drive industry represented approximately and of our net revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended january   two customers each represented more than of our total revenues for a combined total of of our total revenues 
for the year ended  january   five customers each represented more than of our total revenues for a combined total of of our total revenues 
in addition  one distributor accounted for approximately and of our net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
because we sell our products to many oem manufacturers who have manufacturing operations located in asia  a significant percentage of our sales are made to customers located outside of the united states 
sales to customers located in asia represented and in fiscal and  respectively 
the rest of our sales are to customers located in the united states and other geographic regions 
cost of goods sold years ended january  change in cost of goods sold of net revenue gross margin cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and test of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs  and compensation and associated costs relating to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel 
gross margin is calculated as net revenue less cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a product mix change  which included production ramps of our storage socs and wlan products in fiscal compared to fiscal also contributing to the lower gross margins in fiscal were additional costs incurred to qualify other foundries to ensure alternative manufacturing sources 
partially offsetting the decreases in gross margins were lower period costs in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a million reduction in inventory obsolescence reserve charges and decreased material costs due to cost cutting initiatives implemented at our contract manufacturers 
our gross margins are primarily driven by product mix  however  our margins may fluctuate in future periods due to  among other things  changes in the mix of products sold  increased pricing pressures from our customers and competitors  changes in the costs charged by our manufacturing and test subcontractors and changes in the amount of development revenue recognized 
research and development years ended january  change in research and development of net revenue 
table of contents research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  prototype costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional development personnel and personnel related to our acquisition of radlan in june of fiscal and the costs associated with a full year of operations from the syskonnect acquisition in june of fiscal  which all resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
additionally  we incurred costs of million for prototype and related product tape out costs and million of evaluation boards and engineering supplies arising from an increase in new product initiatives many of which were at more costly lower process geometries 
our expenses also increased due to higher depreciation and amortization expense of million arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses for use in research and development activities  increased computer aided design software  or cad  maintenance expenses of million to support increased purchases of cad software and facility and allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to devote resources to develop new products  migrate to lower process geometries  meet the changing requirements of our customers  expand into new markets and technologies such as emerging and power management products  and hire additional personnel 
selling and marketing years ended january  change in selling and marketing of net revenue selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  promotional and other marketing expenses  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in selling and marketing expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and personnel related to our acquisition of radlan in june of fiscal and costs associated with a full year of operations from the syskonnect acquisition in june of fiscal  which all resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
additionally  we incurred other costs of million related to expanding our sales and marketing activities as we broadened our customer and product base  and increased facility and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
in fiscal  we expanded our sales and marketing organizations by focusing efforts on emerging geographies and markets by opening sales offices in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better serve our existing customers worldwide 
we expect that selling and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and expand our sales and marketing efforts into emerging product markets such as power management 
general and administrative years ended january  change in general and administrative of net revenue general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to general and administrative personnel  fees for professional services and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel and personnel related to our acquisition of radlan in june of fiscal and costs associated with a full year of operations from the syskonnect acquisition in june of fiscal  all of which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of 
table of contents million 
our expenses also increased due to higher professional fees of million due to our expanding operations and attorney fees associated with our ongoing legal proceedings 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to additional personnel to support expansion of our operations  increased legal fees due to our ongoing legal proceedings and increased costs to comply with the regulatory requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of amortization of stock based compensation years ended january  change in amortization of stock based compensation of net revenue we have recorded deferred stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees and directors prior to our initial public offering of common stock and in connection with the grant and assumption of stock options as a result of our acquisitions 
deferred stock based compensation is being amortized using an accelerated method over the remaining option vesting period 
the decrease in amortization expense in both absolute dollars and percentage of net revenue of fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from a lower balance of deferred stock based compensation being amortized in fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by increased amortization expense from deferred stock based compensation of million recorded in fiscal as a result of acquisitions completed in fiscal amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other years ended january  change in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other of net revenue in connection with the acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded billion of goodwill and million of acquired intangible assets 
acquired intangible assets are being amortized over its estimated economic life of five years 
in january  we decided to no longer use the galileo trade name in selling and marketing activities going forward 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining million net book value of the trade name in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the acquisition of radlan  we recorded million of goodwill  million of acquired intangible assets and a charge of million related to the recognition of pre acquisition losses due to our prior investments in radlan 
the acquired intangible assets from the radlan acquisition are being amortized over its estimated economic lives of two to five years 
in connection with the acquisition of asica  we recorded million of goodwill and  of acquired intangible assets 
the acquired intangible assets from the asica acquisition are being amortized over their economic life of five years 
the decrease in goodwill and acquired intangible assets amortization expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the million write off of the trade name in fiscal as well as amortization of the trade name in fiscal until it was written off 
facilities consolidation charge years ended january  change in facilities consolidation charge of net revenue 
table of contents during fiscal  we recorded a million charge associated with costs of the consolidation of our facilities 
this charge included million in lease abandonment charges relating to the consolidation of the three facilities in the silicon valley into one location 
this charge includes the remaining lease commitments of these facilities reduced by the estimated sublease income throughout the duration of the lease term 
prior to the consolidation of these facilities  we were leasing three separate facilities in california within ten miles of each other 
we had expanded into two additional facilities because our headcount growth exceeded the capacity of our main california facility and we assumed an additional lease through the acquisition of msil 
the main factors that led to the consolidation of these facilities were that the lease on our main california facility expired in february  a decline in the market lease rates in silicon valley from the prior years and a focus on improving employee productivity by minimizing travel between facilities 
during fiscal  we consolidated our operations in california into one  square foot building that is leased until march  the facilities consolidation charge also includes million associated with property and leasehold improvements relating to the abandoned facilities 
the full carrying value of the property and leasehold improvements were written down as the assets were abandoned along with the leased facilities 
we also incurred charges of million through april  as a result of duplicate lease and other costs associated with the dual occupation of our current and abandoned facilities 
we believe the consolidation of our california facilities has improved employee productivity by decreasing time and costs that were spent traveling between facilities and increasing the frequency of employee meetings between departments that were previously geographically dispersed 
during the quarter ended july   the company subleased the abandoned facilities 
actual sublease income approximated the estimated sublease income

non cash charges in fiscal included million related to the amortization and write off of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and other  million of depreciation and amortization expense  and million of amortization of stock based compensation 
significant working capital changes contributing to positive cash inflow in fiscal included an increase of million in accounts payable resulting primarily from amounts due to our suppliers related to increased inventory purchases during fiscal as well as higher overall spending activity related to our expanding operations and an increase of million relating to accrued employee compensation primarily as the result of increased withholding taxes from the exercise of stock options by employees and increased accrued paid time off due primarily to the increase in number of employees in fiscal compared to fiscal significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flow in fiscal included a million increase in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to increases in our total net revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal although accounts receivable has increased  the days sales outstanding metric  or dso  has remained consistent in fiscal in the range of to days 
many of our larger customers have regularly scheduled payment dates with some of the dates falling immediately before or after our fiscal year end 
as a result  our accounts receivable balance and dso may fluctuate depending on the timing of large payments made by our customers 
inventory increased by million  primarily as a result of increased volumes of sales and associated purchases of inventory required to meet customer demand

significant working capital changes contributing to positive cash inflow in fiscal included an increase of million in accounts payable resulting primarily from amounts due to our suppliers related to increased inventory purchases during fiscal  an increase of million relating to an accrued facilities consolidation charge recorded during fiscal as a result of the consolidation of our facilities and an increase of million in income taxes payable resulting from effective tax rates that were affected by stock based compensation expense and non deductible expenses related to our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flow in fiscal included a million increase in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to increases in our total net revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal inventory increased by million  primarily as a result of increased volumes of sales and associated purchases of inventory required to meet customer demand 
prepaid and other assets increased by million primarily due to prepayment of a royalty to a customer 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities of million was the result of our generation of income during the period excluding the impact on non cash charges and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  million of depreciation and amortization and million of amortization of stock based compensation 
we generated cash flow primarily from a decrease in inventory of million and increases in accounts payable of million  accrued liabilities and other of million  accrued employee compensation of million and income taxes payable of million 
partially offsetting these benefits were increases in accounts receivable of million  prepaid and other assets of million and deferred income taxes of million 
the decrease in inventory is attributable to improved management of inventory in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which included inventory obtained from the acquisition of msil 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of payments to our suppliers 
the increase in income taxes payable is attributable to effective tax rates that were affected by stock based compensation expense and non deductible expenses related to our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the nature of our business  we experience working capital needs for accounts receivable and inventory 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis with net thirty to sixty day payment terms 
if our sales levels were to increase as they have in prior fiscal years  it is likely that our levels of accounts receivable would also increase 
our levels of accounts receivable would also increase if customers delayed their payments or if we offered extended payment terms to our customers 
additionally  in order to maintain an adequate supply of product for our customers  we must carry a certain level of inventory 
our inventory level may vary based primarily upon orders received from our customers and our forecast of demand for these products  as well as the initial production ramp for significant design wins 
other considerations in determining inventory levels may include the product life cycle stage of our products  foundry lead times and available capacity  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the fiscal year ended january  and net cash used in investing activities of million for the fiscal year ended january  the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to purchases of short term investments of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  and loan advances of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short term investments of million 
the significant increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily due to our purchase of six buildings on acres of land in santa clara  california for a total cost of million 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to purchases of short term investments of million  equity investments in other companies of million  purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale and maturities of short term investments of million 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to purchases of short term investments of million  the payment of million of accrued acquisition costs relating to our 
table of contents acquisition of msil  and purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses of million  partially offset by the proceeds from maturities of short term investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  and million for the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  partially offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations 
the increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock is due to exercises of stock options by employees as a result of the increase in our stock price 
the increase in capital lease obligations is due to additional cad software licenses  which we have acquired for use in our research and development activities 
in fiscal and  net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
our relationships with our foundries allow us to cancel all outstanding purchase orders  provided we pay the foundries for all expenses they have incurred in connection with our purchase orders through the date of cancellation 
as of january   foundries had incurred approximately million of manufacturing expenses on our outstanding purchase orders 
in october  we entered into a lease agreement with yahoo inc to lease a building in sunnyvale  california consisting of approximately  square feet 
the lease commenced on january  and continues through march  total rent payments over the term of the lease will be approximately million 
in february  we consolidated our three existing facilities in california into this new building 
the lease on one of our former facilities expired in february  but we have ongoing  non cancelable leases for the two other facilities 
during fiscal  we recorded a million charge associated with costs of consolidation of our facilities 
this charge included million in lease abandonment charges relating to the consolidation of our three facilities in california into one location 
this charge included the remaining lease commitments of these facilities reduced by the estimated sublease income for the duration of the lease term 
prior to the consolidation of these facilities  we were leasing three separate facilities in california within ten miles of each other 
we had expanded into two additional facilities because our headcount growth exceeded the capacity of our main california facility and we assumed an additional lease through the acquisition of msil 
the main factors that led to the consolidation of these three facilities were that the lease on our main california facility expired in february  a decline in market lease rates in silicon valley from the prior years and a focus on improving employee productivity by minimizing travel between facilities 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we obtained subleases for the abandoned facilities 
actual sublease income approximated the estimated sublease income  but is less than our actual lease commitments  resulting in negative cash flow over the remaining term of the subleases of approximately million 
at january   cash payments of million  net of sublease income had been made in connection with this charge 
approximately million is accrued for the facilities consolidation charge as of january  of which million is the current portion while the long term portion totaling million is payable through on june   we completed the acquisition of radlan computer communications ltd 
upon the closing  we issued a total of  shares of common stock valued at million and assumed  of vested options valued at million 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share valued at million 
on october   we issued an additional  shares valued at million to former radlan shareholders 
on december   certain milestones were achieved and  shares of common stock valued at million were earned and issued to former radlan shareholders 
additionally   shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuance over a one year period to former radlan shareholders which is dependent upon our revenues from certain products for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  
table of contents on november   we completed the purchase of six buildings on acres of land in santa clara  california for a total cost of million in cash 
it is currently intended that the site will be the future location of our us headquarters 
as a result of the purchase of the buildings  we expect to make significant commitments and incur costs to improve the buildings over the next twelve to eighteen months 
we are still in the preliminary planning stages of defining the scope of the work to be performed as well as selecting contractors 
as such  we have not been able to assess and determine how much we expect to incur in connection with the improvements for the buildings 
in addition  we expect an increase in future operating expenses due to the new buildings  thereby increasing the amount of occupancy costs that will be allocated to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
on november   we completed the acquisition of asica  inc prior to the acquisition  we owned of the outstanding equity of asica 
upon closing we issued a total of  shares of common stock valued at million to acquire the remaining outstanding equity and assumed  vested options valued at approximately  we currently intend to fund our short and long term capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as well as cash generated by operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital requirements  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
however  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the timing and extent of research and development projects  costs of making improvements to facilities and increases in operating expenses  which are all subject to uncertainty 
to the extent that our existing cash  cash equivalent and investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing  which in turn may be dilutive to our current shareholders 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than after year years years total contractual obligations operating leases capital lease obligations purchase commitments to foundries total contractual cash obligations as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for fiscal  and recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires 
table of contents certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities  or vies  created or acquired after january  in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
fin r clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including the equity holders 
fin r requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of fin r a clarified some requirements of the original fin  which had been issued in january  b eased some implementation problems  and c added new scope exceptions 
fin r deferred the effective date of the interpretation for vies created or acquired prior to february  for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after march   except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered special purpose entities in practice and under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december  among the scope exceptions  companies are not required to apply fin r to an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a business as defined in the interpretation unless one or more of four named conditions exist 
the adoption of fin r for investments acquired prior to february  is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first fiscal period beginning after june  sfas no 
is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of sfas no 
and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
restatement is not permitted 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions during fiscal year  we incurred approximately million of business travel and airplane operating expenses from an unrelated third party entity  acm aviation  inc acm 
the airplane provided by acm to us is owned by estopia air  llc estopia  a delaware limited liability company  owned and controlled by dr 
sehat sutardja  our chairman  president and ceo  and weili dai  our executive vice president 
acm manages and operates the airplane on behalf of estopia 
the million of expenses was the result of our use of the plane for business travel purposes 
the pricing was based on values determined to be market prices 
in october  we entered into a lease agreement with a privately held design technology firm for certain computer aided design software 
we selected this product after an evaluation of competitive products on the strength of its merits 
one of the officers of the design technology firm is the brother of an officer and director of marvell and is also a shareholder of marvell 
the design technology firm was acquired by cadence design systems in december and the lease agreement was subsequently amended in june total principal  interest and maintenance payments over the year term of the lease will be million 
the 
table of contents remaining lease payments as of january  are included in the capital lease commitment table in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additional factors that may affect future results in addition to the factors discussed in the overview and liquidity and capital resources sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following additional factors may affect our future results 
many of these factors are beyond our control  including business cycles and seasonal trends of the computing  semiconductor and related industries 
a significant portion of our business is dependent upon the hard disk drive industry  which is highly cyclical and experiences rapid technological change 
sales to customers in the hard disk drive industry represented approximately of our net revenue in fiscal and represented and of our net revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
the hard disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and the technology changes rapidly 
as a result  this industry is highly cyclical  with periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction 
these cycles may affect us as our customers are suppliers to this industry 
hard disk drive manufacturers tend to order more components than they may need during growth periods  and sharply reduce orders for components during periods of contraction 
in addition  advances in existing technologies and the introduction of new technologies may result in lower demand for disk drive storage devices  thereby reducing demand for our products 
rapid technological changes in the hard disk drive industry often result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry s participants 
if the hard disk drive manufacturers using our products do not retain or increase market share  our sales may decrease 
our marvell semiconductor israel ltd  marvell ti ltd 
and radlan computer communications ltd 
subsidiaries are incorporated under the laws of  and their principal offices are located in  the state of israel and therefore their business operations may be harmed by adverse political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
each of marvell semiconductor israel ltd  or msil  marvell ti ltd  or mtil and radlan computer communications ltd  or radlan  are incorporated under the laws of and has its principal offices in the state of israel 
in addition  msil and radlan maintain their research and development operations in israel 
thus  msil  mtil and radlan are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
major hostilities involving or within israel could disrupt msil  mtil and radlan s operations 
for example  continued hostilities between israel and the palestinian authority in recent months have caused substantial political unrest  which could lead to a potential economic downturn in israel 
additionally  the ongoing situation in iraq could lead to more economic instability and uncertainty in the state of israel and the middle east 
also  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could negatively impact the business operations and financial results of each of msil  mtil and radlan 
we depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our sales 
the loss of  or a significant reduction or cancellation in sales to  any key customer would significantly reduce our revenues 
in the fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to two customers  each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
of these customers  intel accounted for approximately and samsung accounted for approximately 
additionally  wintech  a distributor  accounted for approximately of our net revenue during fiscal sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer  as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets  and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future 
the loss of any of our largest customers  a significant reduction in sales we make to them  or any problems we encounter collecting amounts 
table of contents due from them would likely seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers  as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products 
in the future  these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all  to purchase fewer products than they did in the past  or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way  particularly because substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  which permits our customers to cancel  change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty  our customers may develop their own solutions  our customers may purchase integrated circuits from our competitors  and our customers may discontinue sales in the markets for which they purchase our products 
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner  our operating results and competitive position will be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability  in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop new products for the broadband communications market and to introduce enhancements to our products for the storage market 
we must also achieve market acceptance for these products and enhancements 
if we do not successfully develop and achieve market acceptance for new and enhanced products  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will suffer 
the development of our products is highly complex 
we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements  and we could experience delays in the future 
in particular  we have a limited history in developing products for the broadband communications market and may encounter technical difficulties in developing wireless lan or other products for this market that could prevent or delay their successful introduction 
unanticipated problems in developing broadband communications products could also divert substantial engineering resources  which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements for the storage market  and could substantially increase our costs 
even if the new and enhanced products are introduced to the market  we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of these products in a timely manner 
successful product development and market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors  including timely and cost effective completion and introduction of new product designs  adoption of our products by customers that are among the first to adopt new technologies and by customers perceived to be market leaders  timely qualification and certification of our products for use in our customers products  the level of acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers  cost and availability of foundry  assembly and testing capacity  availability  price  performance  power  use and size of our products and competing products and technologies  our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness  successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers and strategic partners  and our ability to predict and respond to changes in technology  industry standards or end user preferences 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are 
table of contents lower than the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products  and the failure of any of these third party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers  decrease our sales and limit our growth 
we do not have our own manufacturing or assembly facilities and have very limited in house testing facilities 
therefore  we must rely on third party vendors to manufacture  assemble and test the products we design 
we currently rely on tsmc to produce a significant amount of our integrated circuit products 
we also currently rely on tsmc and other third party assembly and test subcontractors to assemble  package and test our products 
the resurgence of sars and any similar future outbreaks in asia could affect the production capabilities of our manufacturers by resulting in quarantines or closures 
in the event of such a quarantine or closure  if we were unable to quickly identify alternate manufacturing facilities  our revenues  cost of revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
if these vendors do not provide us with high quality products and services in a timely manner  or if one or more of these vendors terminates its relationship with us  we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis  our relationships with our customers could suffer  our sales could decrease and our growth could be limited 
other significant risks associated with relying on these third party vendors include our customers or their customers may fail to approve or delay approving our selected supplier  we have reduced control over product cost  delivery schedules and product quality  the warranties on wafers or products supplied to us are limited  and we face increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we currently do not have long term supply contracts with any of our third party vendors 
therefore  they are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantities  or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
none of our third party foundry or assembly and test subcontractors have provided contractual assurances to us that adequate capacity will be available to us to meet future demand for our products 
these foundries may allocate capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
in particular  foundry customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long term agreements with these foundries may cause these foundries to reallocate capacity to those customers  decreasing the capacity available to us 
if we need another integrated circuit foundry or assembly and test subcontractor because of increased demand  or we are unable to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our providers at the required time  we might not be able to develop relationships with other vendors who are able to satisfy our requirements 
even if other integrated circuit foundries or assembly and test subcontractors are available at that time to satisfy our requirements  it would likely take several months to acquire a new provider 
such a change may also require the approval of our customers  which would take time to effect and could cause our customers to cancel orders or fail to place new orders 
recently  the worldwide supply of packaging substrates that we use for our products has shrunk due to the fact that two suppliers of these products have exited the market  while demand for the substrates has increased 
if our third party subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials for our products in a timely manner  we may experience a significant product shortage or delay in product shipments  which could seriously harm our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our net sales 

table of contents the uncertain and volatile worldwide economy  acts of war  terrorism  international conflicts and related uncertainties may adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
in the last three years  worldwide economic conditions have experienced a downturn due to slower economic activity  concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries  the situation in iraq and recent international conflicts  and terrorist and military activity have resulted in a downturn in worldwide economic conditions 
we cannot predict the timing  strength and duration of any economic recovery in the semiconductor industry and in particular  the broadband communications markets 
in addition  the events of september   the continuing international conflicts and terrorist acts and the possibility of an extended united states presence in iraq can be expected to place further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide 
also  a resurgence or perceived resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars or a similar outbreak  could have a further adverse effect upon an already weakened world economy 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
although recently we have seen some signs of recovery in the worldwide economy  we cannot predict the timing  strength and duration of any economic recovery  worldwide or in our served markets 
if the economy does not continue to recover  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely suffer 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
on november   we completed the purchase of six buildings on acres of land in santa clara  california for a total cost of million 
it is currently intended that the site will be the future location of our us headquarters 
the real property includes land and buildings  primarily related to our operations 
we have little experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to risks  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic and other legal or regulatory requirements  the potential disruption of our business and operations arising from or connected with a relocation due to moving to the facility  increased cash commitments for improvements to the buildings or the property or both  increased operating expenses for the buildings or the property or both  possible disputes with tenants or other third parties related to the buildings or the property or both  and the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of an earthquake 
we are a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors  and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase or maintain revenue and market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  our market share and revenues may not increase or may decline 
in addition  most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and name recognition  and a larger base of customers than we do 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than us  which 
table of contents would allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
in addition  new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge 
we expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors  other manufacturers and designers of integrated circuits  and innovative start up integrated circuit design companies 
many of our customers are also large  established integrated circuit suppliers 
our sales to and support of such customers may enable them to become a source of competition to us  despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights 
in the wireless lan market  we face competition from a number of additional competitors who have a longer history of serving that market 
many of these competitors have more established reputations in that market and longer standing relationships with the customers to whom we sell our products  which could prevent us from competing successfully 
competition could increase pressure on us to lower our prices and lower our margins  which  in turn  would harm our operating results 
we may have difficulty in accurately predicting our future sales and appropriately budgeting for our expenses  and we may not be able to maintain our existing growth rate 
the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we sell our products limits our ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual sales 
additionally  because many of our expenses are fixed in the short term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales 
we are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expense levels in anticipation of future sales growth 
if our sales do not increase as anticipated  significant losses could result due to our higher expense levels 
although we have experienced sales and earnings growth in prior quarterly and annual periods  we may not be able to sustain these growth rates  particularly in the period of economic slowdown we are currently experiencing 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future performance 
because we do not have long term commitments from our customers  we must estimate customer demand  and errors in our estimates can have negative effects on our inventory levels  sales and operating results 
our sales are made on the basis of individual purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders 
we have historically placed firm orders for products with our suppliers up to sixteen weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to receiving an order for the product 
therefore  our order volumes are based on our forecasts of demand from our customers 
this process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect or at all 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would harm our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
on occasion  we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders  and therefore  were unable to benefit from this increased demand 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied in significant part on our strategic relationships with customers that are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our partners frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in the development could 
table of contents impair our relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
if our foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields or quality  our relationships with our customers and our reputation will be harmed 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a complex and technically demanding process 
our foundries have from time to time experienced manufacturing defects and reduced manufacturing yields 
changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
poor yields from our foundries  or defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could cause us significant customer relations and business reputation problems  harm our financial results and result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
in addition  defects in our existing or new products could result in significant warranty  support and repair costs  and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
when demand for foundry capacity is high  we may take various actions to try to secure sufficient capacity  which may be costly and harm our operating results 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced due to strong demand 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a guaranteed level of production capacity with any of our foundries 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand  and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are or that have long term agreements with our main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
this reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we use three independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor products  most of our components are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time  and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries will be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields  or that our foundries will be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or at reasonable prices 
these and other related factors could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results 
in order to secure sufficient foundry capacity when demand is high and mitigate the risks described in the foregoing paragraph  we may enter into various arrangements with suppliers that could be costly and harm our operating results  including option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of integrated circuits over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  
table of contents investment in a foundry  and other contractual relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and any arrangements may be costly  reduce our financial flexibility  and not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses in undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products  damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
historically  we have been able to design workarounds to fix these defects and bugs with minimal to no disruption to our business or our customers business 
going forward  if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality  or compatibility problems  we may not be able to successfully design workarounds 
consequently  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers  and our financial results 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
as a result  our financial results could be materially harmed 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully and cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
past acquisitions and any future acquisitions or transactions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies  augment our market segment coverage  or enhance our technological 
table of contents capabilities 
we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition  investment  alliance  or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions or relationships will be successful 
any transactions or relationships will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered with those matters 
risks that could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition include  among other things the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the distraction of management from our business  the potential inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position as a result of an acquisition  the potential difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management personnel  the risk of entering market segments in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such market segments have stronger market segment positions  and the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company 
our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions could harm our operating results and share price 
any acquisitions could materially harm our operating results as a result of possible concurrent issuances of dilutive equity securities 
in addition  the purchase price of any acquired businesses may exceed the current fair values of the net tangible assets of the acquired businesses 
as a result  we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which could result in significant impairment charges and amortization expense in future periods 
these charges  in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot forecast the number  timing or size of future acquisitions  or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operating or financial results 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we are required to review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis 
over the past few years  there has been a slowdown in worldwide economies  including the united states  which has affected our business 
end customers for our products have slowed their purchases of next generation technology and have delayed or rescheduled existing orders for products that incorporate our technology 
although recently we have seen some signs of recovery in the worldwide economy  we cannot predict the timing  strength and duration of any economic recovery  worldwide or in our served markets 
if the economy does not continue to recover  or if other presently unforeseen events or changes in circumstances arise which indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will be required to perform impairment reviews of these assets  which have carrying values of approximately billion as of january  an impairment review could result in a write down of all or a portion of these assets to their fair values 
we will perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in light of the large carrying value associated with our goodwill and intangible assets  any write down of these assets may result in a significant charge to our statement of operations in the period any impairment is determined and could cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents we depend on key personnel with whom we do not have employment agreements to manage our business  and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel  our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  including engineers and sales and marketing personnel  could delay the development and introduction of  and harm our ability to sell  our products 
we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of dr 
sehat sutardja  our co founder  president and chief executive officer  weili dai  our co founder and executive vice president  and dr 
pantas sutardja  our co founder and chief technology officer 
we do not have employment contracts with these or any other key personnel  and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
there is currently a shortage of qualified technical personnel with significant experience in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and sales of integrated circuits for use in communications products 
in particular  there is a shortage of engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacture of products based on analog technology  and competition for these engineers is intense 
our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the source of our technological and product innovations 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to support our anticipated growth 
our officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock  and three existing directors  who are also significant shareholders  are related by blood or marriage 
these factors may allow the officers and directors as a group or the three related directors to greatly influence the election of directors and the approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions 
as of march   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned or controlled  directly or indirectly  approximately of the outstanding shares our common stock 
additionally  dr 
sehat sutardja and weili dai are husband and wife and dr 
sehat sutardja and dr 
pantas sutardja are brothers 
all three are directors and together they held approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as a result  if the directors and officers as a group or any of dr 
sehat sutardja  weili dai  and dr 
pantas sutardja act together  they will significantly influence the election of our directors and the approval or disapproval of our significant corporate actions 
this influence over our affairs might be adverse to the interests of other shareholders 
in addition  the voting power of these officers or directors could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of us on terms that other shareholders may desire 
under bermuda law all of our officers  in exercising their powers and discharging their duties  must act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and exercise the care  diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances 
majority shareholders do not owe fiduciary duties to minority shareholders 
as a result  the minority shareholders will not have a direct claim against the majority shareholders in the event the majority shareholders take actions that damage the interests of minority shareholders 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda  except the bermuda courts would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in our name if the directors or officers are alleged to be acting beyond our corporate power  committing illegal acts or violating our memorandum of association or bye laws 
in addition  minority shareholders would be able to challenge a corporate action that allegedly constituted a fraud against them or required the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
our rapid growth has strained our resources and our inability to manage any future growth could harm our profitability 
our rapid growth has placed  and any future growth of our operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
we anticipate that we will need to implement a 
table of contents variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems 
we also expect that we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  our operating results could be harmed 
in may  we completed the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system 
in addition  we have recently completed the implementation and integration of certain modules of the erp system for subsidiaries that we recently acquired 
we also plan to implement new modules of the erp system in the future 
implementation of new modules of an erp system is a very complex  costly and time consuming process 
any unforeseen delays or difficulties after we begin transacting on the new system or in performing financial closes on  or upgrades to the new systems  may divert the attention of management and other employees and disrupt our ongoing business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks  which may harm our results of operations  because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states and  as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
all of our products are manufactured outside of the united states 
our current qualified integrated circuit foundries are located in the same region within taiwan  and our primary assembly and test subcontractors are located in the pacific rim region 
in addition  many of our customers are located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  which further exposes us to foreign risks 
sales to customers located in asia represented approximately of our net revenue in fiscal  and represented and of our net revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
we anticipate that our manufacturing  assembly  testing and sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our operations and revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with international operations  including difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses  compliance with foreign laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  trade restrictions or higher tariffs  transportation delays  difficulties of managing distributors  especially because we expect to continue to increase our sales through international distributors  political and economic instability  including wars  terrorism  other hostilities and political unrest  boycotts  curtailment of trade and other business restrictions  and inadequate local infrastructure 
additionally  our operations may be impacted in the following ways by a resurgence of sars  including  but not limited to  disruptions of our third party manufacturers that are primarily located in asia  reduced sales in our international retail channels and increased supply chain costs 
if future outbreaks of sars or similar diseases arise or spread to other areas  our international sales and operations could be harmed 
because substantially all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  potentially leading to a reduction in sales and profitability for us in that country 
a portion of our international revenue may be denominated in 
table of contents foreign currencies in the future  which will subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates for those foreign currencies 
our third party foundries and subcontractors are concentrated in taiwan and elsewhere in the pan pacific region  an area subject to significant earthquake risks 
any disruption to the operations of these foundries and subcontractors resulting from earthquakes or other natural disasters could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  which is located in taiwan 
currently our only alternative manufacturing sources are located in taiwan  china and singapore 
in addition  substantially all of our assembly and testing facilities are located in singapore  taiwan and the philippines 
the risk of an earthquake in taiwan and elsewhere in the pacific rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines to the facilities of our foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
in september  a major earthquake in taiwan affected the facilities of several of these third party contractors 
as a consequence of this earthquake  these contractors suffered power outages and disruptions that impaired their production capacity 
in march and june  major earthquakes occurred in taiwan 
although our foundries and subcontractors did not suffer any significant damage as a result of this most recent earthquake  the occurrence of additional earthquakes or other natural disasters could result in the disruption of our foundry or assembly and test capacity 
any disruption resulting from such events could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing  assembling or testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor 
we may not be able to obtain alternate capacity on favorable terms  if at all 
we rely on third party distributors and manufacturers representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales 
we sell our communications products to customers primarily through distributors and manufacturers representatives 
our relationships with some of our distributors and manufacturers representatives have been established within the last two years  and we are unable to predict the extent to which our distributors and manufacturers representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
moreover  many of our manufacturers representatives and distributors also market and sell competing products 
our representatives and distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our future performance will also depend  in part  on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
if we cannot retain our current distributors or manufacturers representatives or recruit additional or replacement distributors or manufacturers representatives  our sales and operating results will be harmed 
the loss of one or more of our distributors or manufacturers representatives could harm our sales and results of operations 
we generally realize a higher gross margin on direct sales and from sales through manufacturers representatives than on sales through distributors 
accordingly  if our distributors were to account for an increased portion of our net sales  our gross margins may decline 
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross profits 
the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications 
as a result  the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly 
our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  reducing our costs  or developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits 
we expect that our gross profits on our products are likely to decrease over the next fiscal year below levels we have historically experienced due to i pricing pressures from our customers  ii an increase in sales of socs  which typically have lower margins than standalone read channel devices  and iii an increase in sales of wlan and other products into consumer application markets  which are highly competitive and cost sensitive 
in addition  if our sales of storage products into the desktop computer market were to increase as a percentage of total storage revenues  our margins would also likely decrease because gross margins on sales 
table of contents into this market are generally lower than for sales into the enterprise and mobile computer markets  where we currently generate the substantial majority of our storage product revenues 
additionally  because we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  and our costs may even increase  which could also reduce our margins 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
we expect that we will have to do so again in the future 
we have a lengthy and expensive storage product sales cycle that does not assure product sales  and that if unsuccessful  may harm our operating results 
the sales cycle for our storage products is long and requires us to invest significant resources with each potential customer without any assurance of sales to that customer 
our sales cycle typically begins with a three to six month evaluation and test period  also known as qualification  during which our products undergo rigorous reliability testing by our customers 
qualification is typically followed by a twelve to eighteen month development period by our customers and an additional three to six month period before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
this lengthy sales cycle creates the risk that our customers will decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our integrated circuits 
during our sales cycle  our engineers assist customers in implementing our products into the customers products 
we incur significant research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses as part of this process  and this process may never generate related revenues 
we derive revenue from this process only if our design is selected 
once a customer selects a particular integrated circuit for use in a storage product  the customer generally uses solely that integrated circuit for a full generation of its product 
therefore  if we do not achieve a design win for a product  we will be unable to sell our integrated circuit to a customer until that customer develops a new product or a new generation of its product 
even if we achieve a design win with a customer  the customer may not ultimately ship products incorporating our products or may cancel orders after we have achieved a sale 
in addition  we will have to begin the qualification process again when a customer develops a new generation of a product for which we were the successful supplier 
also  during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of our integrated circuits 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if our products are incorporated into both our customers mature and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product may cause the customer to lose sales  which would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinued mature product 
in addition  customers may defer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from our competitors or us 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit industry 
the current and any future downturns will likely reduce our revenue and result in excess inventory 
the integrated circuit industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has recently experienced a significant downturn 
these downturns are often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both integrated circuit companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
the current downturn and any future downturns may reduce our revenue or our percentage of revenue growth on a quarter to quarter basis and result in us having excess inventory 
furthermore  any upturn in the integrated circuit industry could result in increased competition for access to third party foundry  assembly and test capacity 

table of contents the development and evolution of markets for our integrated circuits are dependent on factors  such as industry standards  over which we have no control 
for example  if our customers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible or fail to adopt standards with which our products are compatible  our existing products would become less desirable to our customers and our sales would suffer 
the emergence of markets for our integrated circuits is affected by a variety of factors beyond our control 
in particular  our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards 
our customers may not adopt or continue to follow these standards  which would make our products less desirable to our customers and reduce our sales 
also  competing standards may emerge that are preferred by our customers  which could also reduce our sales and require us to make significant expenditures to develop new products 
we have made a significant investment in the development and production of our gigabit ethernet products  including our physical layer devices and switched ethernet products 
however  the gigabit ethernet technology is relatively new compared to the more established and megabit per second fast ethernet technologies 
if the gigabit ethernet technology does not achieve widespread market acceptance  our revenue and operating results may be harmed 
we have also made a significant investment in the development of wireless lan products based on the ieee b and g standards 
wireless lan technologies are relatively new and many competing standards  such as ieee a and bluetooth tm  exist 
if the b and g standards do not achieve widespread market acceptance  our revenue and operating results may be harmed 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  which would negatively affect our ability to compete 
we believe one of our key competitive advantages results from our collection of proprietary technologies that we have developed since our inception 
if we fail to protect these intellectual property rights  competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed  which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenues 
we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and business partners  and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
we have been issued several united states patents and have a number of pending united states patent applications 
however  a patent may not be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or proprietary technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and the steps that we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may become involved with costly and lengthy litigation  which could subject us to liability  require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products 
litigation involving patents and other intellectual property is widespread in the high technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the integrated circuit industry  where a number of companies aggressively bring numerous infringement claims to protect their patent portfolios 
from time to time we receive  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties 
these claims could result in litigation  which  in turn  could subject us to significant liability for damages 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  pay substantial damages to the party claiming infringement that could adversely impact our liquidity or operating results  
table of contents attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
we are also party to other claims and litigation proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
the impact on us as a result of such claims and litigation cannot currently be ascertained 
there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future that may adversely impact gross margins 
any litigation  regardless of the outcome  are time consuming and expensive to resolve  require us to pay significant monetary damages and divert management time and attention 
we are incorporated in bermuda  and  as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
we are organized under the laws of bermuda 
as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to effect service of process within the united states upon us  or to enforce against us in united states courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
most of our executive officers and directors are residents of the united states 
however  there is significant doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state or hear actions brought in bermuda against us or those persons based on those laws 
the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not based solely on united states federal or state securities laws  would not be automatically enforceable in bermuda 
our bye laws contain a waiver of claims or rights of action by our shareholders against our officers and directors  which will severely limit our shareholders right to assert a claim against our officers and directors under bermuda law 
our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers and directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties with or for us  other than with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director 
this waiver will limit the rights of our shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act complained of involves actual fraud or dishonesty 
thus  so long as acts of business judgment do not involve actual fraud or dishonesty  they will not be subject to shareholder claims under bermuda law 
for example  shareholders will not have claims against officers and directors for a breach of trust  unless the breach rises to the level of actual fraud or dishonesty 
tax benefits we receive may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
under current bermuda law  we are not subject to tax on our income or capital gains 
we have obtained from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempt undertakings tax protection act  as amended  an undertaking that  in the event that bermuda enacts any legislation imposing tax computed on income or capital gains  those taxes should not apply to us until march  however  this exemption may not be extended beyond that date 
the economic development board of singapore granted pioneer status to our wholly owned subsidiary in singapore in july for a period of at least six years  commencing july  as a result  we anticipate that a significant portion of the income we earn in singapore during this period will be exempt from the singapore statutory tax rate 
we are required to meet several requirements as to investment  headcount and activities in singapore to retain this status 
if our pioneer status is terminated early  our financial results could be harmed 

table of contents the israeli government has granted approved enterprise status to certain wholly owned subsidiaries in israel  which provides a tax holiday on undistributed income derived from operations within certain development regions in israel 
in order to maintain our qualification  we must continue to meet specified conditions  including the making of investments in fixed assets in israel 
as our tax holidays expire  we expect that we will start paying income tax on our operations within these development regions 
class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
on september   a putative class action was filed in the southern district of new york relating to our initial public offering  or ipo 
in this action  the plaintiffs named several defendants including marvell and two of our officers  one of whom is also a director 
this complaint relating to our ipo has been consolidated with hundreds of other lawsuits by plaintiffs against approximately underwriters and approximately issuers across the united states 
plaintiffs allege that defendants violated various provisions of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of in these actions  plaintiffs seek  among other items  unspecified damages  pre judgment interest and reimbursement of attorneys and experts fees 
a consolidated amended class action complaint against marvell and two of our officers was filed on april  subsequently  defendants in the consolidated proceedings moved to dismiss the actions 
in february  the trial court issued its ruling on the motions  granting the motions in part  and denying them in part 
thus  the cases may proceed against the underwriters and us as to alleged violations of section of the securities act of and section b of the securities exchange act of claims against the individual officers have been voluntarily dismissed with prejudice by agreement with plaintiffs 
these claims and any resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
companies in the integrated circuit industry and other technology industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices 
accordingly  we may in the future be the target of securities litigation 
any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price 
a substantial number of our shares remain available for sale pursuant to rule future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to decline 
as of march   we had  shares outstanding and none of these shares are subject to any lock up agreements 
the market price of our stock could drop significantly if holders of a substantial number of our shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 
in addition  the sale of our shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock 
our bye laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in corporate control  even if the change in corporate control would benefit our shareholders 
our bye laws contain change in corporate control provisions which include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  and requiring a vote of two thirds of the outstanding shares to approve any change of corporate control 
these change in corporate control provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be a benefit to our shareholders 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
also variable rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities including money market funds  corporate debt securities  federal  state  county and municipal debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of january  in thousands 
this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
expected fiscal year maturity date total fair value variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of january  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments  which totaled million at january   are included in other non current assets in the accompanying balance sheets and are accounted for under the cost method as our ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations on these companies 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
foreign currency exchange risk 
substantially all of our sales and the majority of our expenses to date have been denominated in united states dollars  and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
occasionally  we will enter into short term forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures for purchases denominated in foreign currencies such as the singapore dollar and the new israeli shekel 
we do not enter into any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
