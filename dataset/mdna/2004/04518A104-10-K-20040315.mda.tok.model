item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of high quality software and solutions in china 
we provide total customer solutions to some of china s largest companies  and help our customers to increase their business value in fast growing and evolving markets 
in the telecommunications market  our software products and network services enable our customers to build  maintain  operate  manage and continuously improve their communications infrastructure 
our largest customers are the major telecommunications carriers in china and their provincial subsidiaries  such as china telecommunications corporation  or china telecom  china network communications group corporation  or china netcom group  china mobile communications corporation  or china mobile  and china united telecommunications corporation  or china unicom 
recently  through our acquisition of a human resources management  or hrm  and business intelligence  or bi  software business  we have gained exposure to new customers in industries such as transportation  power and iron and steel 
we commenced our operations in the united states in and moved our major operations from the united states to china in we began generating significant network solutions revenues in and significant software revenues in we conduct the bulk of our business through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries  asiainfo technologies china inc  or asiainfo technologies  and asiainfo management software  inc  or asiainfo management  which are both chinese companies 
we believe that there are opportunities for us to expand into new business areas and to continue to grow our business both organically and through acquisitions 
on december   we completed our acquisition of certain hrm and bi assets valued at approximately million from pacific software china limited  a privately held  medium sized software solutions company based in hong kong  and from its affiliate  new century pacific software beijing limited  a wholly foreign owned enterprise based in beijing  china 
we expect that the acquisition will help us to expand into the hrm and bi software markets  and expose us to customers in other industries  outside of our traditional telecommunications customer base 
reliance on key customers 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers  such as china telecom  china unicom  china mobile and china netcom group 
sales to china telecom and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china unicom and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china netcom group and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china mobile and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the sum of our top five receivable balances represented and of the total receivable balances for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have expanded our customer base recently through the acquisition of an hrm and bi software business with customers in sectors such as transportation and energy 
however  our operating results are still dependent on our large customers in the telecommunications sector  and the loss of any of those customers could have a material adverse impact on us 
impact of goodwill impairments 
in connection with our acquisition of bonson information technology holdings limited  we paid the former shareholders of that company million net of acquisition costs in cash and  shares of our common stock which were valued at approximately million at the time the acquisition was announced 
during the first quarter of  we completed an annual impairment test as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million relating to the goodwill and acquired intangible assets attributable to our acquisition of bonson 
in december  we conducted an impairment test in connection with our investment in intrinsic technology holdings  inc  in which we hold a minority stake  and recorded a charge of million 
although we do not presently anticipate any further impairment charges  any future deterioration of market conditions or other changes may require us to record additional impairment charges in the future  which would impact our net income loss 
impact of sars outbreak 
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  is believed to have started in guangdong province  china in late and to have later spread to beijing 
the sars outbreak impacted our second quarter revenues by disrupting travel throughout china and causing delays in service delivery to our customers 
in addition  the outbreak of sars interrupted our collection efforts  causing our days sales outstanding to increase to days at the end of the second quarter of although the spread of sars in china has been contained and our business activities resumed normal operations during the third quarter of  the medical community worldwide has not fully understood the origin of sars and has not found a well recognized effective treatment for sars 
as a consequence  the potential long term effects of sars on economic growth in china are still unknown 
since january   a small number of new sars cases have been reported in china 
any future worsening of the sars epidemic could have an adverse impact on our business 
revenues we report our revenues on the basis of the two principal types of revenues derived from our business network solutions revenues and software revenues 
network solutions revenue 
network solutions revenue consists of hardware sales for equipment procured by us on behalf of our customers from hardware vendors  as well as services for network planning  design  systems integration and training 
we procure for and sell hardware to our customers as part of our total solutions strategy 
we minimize our exposure to hardware risks by sourcing equipment from hardware vendors against letters of credit from our customers 
we believe that as the telecommunications related market in china develops our customers will increasingly purchase hardware directly from hardware vendors and hire us for our professional services 
software revenue 
software revenues include two types of revenues software license revenue and software services revenue 
software license revenue consists of fees received from customers for licenses or sublicenses to use our software products as well as third party software products in perpetuity  typically up to a specified maximum number of users 
in most cases  our customers must purchase additional user licenses from us when the number of users exceeds the specified maximum 
our software license revenue also includes the benefit of value added tax rebates on software license sales  which are part of the chinese government s policy of encouraging china s software industry 
software services revenue consists of revenue from software installation  customization  training and other services 
net revenues 
although we report our revenues on a gross basis  inclusive of hardware acquisition costs that are passed through to our customers  we manage our business internally based on revenues net of hardware costs  which is consistent with our strategy of providing our customers with high value it professional services and  where efficient  outsourcing lower end services such as hardware acquisition and installation 
this strategy may result in lower growth rates for total revenues as against prior periods  but will not adversely impact revenues net of hardware costs 
the following table shows our revenue breakdown on this basis and reconciles our net revenues to our total revenues years ended december  amount in thousands of us network solutions net of hardware costs 
     software revenue      total revenues net of hardware costs 
     total hardware costs      total revenues      the information on revenues net of hardware costs in the above table is a non gaap financial measures within the meaning of item of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
we have provided a reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  total gross revenues 
we believe that the presentation of this non gaap measure provides useful information for investors regarding our regular financial performance 
our management uses this measure for the same purpose 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 
cost of revenues network solutions costs 
network solutions costs consist primarily of third party hardware costs  compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in designing and implementing projects  and hardware warranty costs 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  in large projects we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
we accrue hardware warranty costs upon final acceptance 
we obtain manufacturers warranties for hardware we sell  which cover a portion of the warranties that we give to our customers 
we currently accrue of hardware sales to cover potential warranty expenses 
this estimate of warranty cost is based on our current experience with contracts for which the warranty period has expired 
software costs 
software costs consist primarily of three components 
packaging and written manual expenses for our proprietary software products  
compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in modifying  customizing or installing our software products and in providing consultation  training and support services  and 
software license fees paid to third party software providers for the right to sublicense their products to our customers as part of our solutions offerings 
the costs associated with designing and modifying the formulation of our proprietary software are classified as research and development expenses as incurred 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  and amortization expenses for intangible assets and deferred stock compensation and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
compensation expenses consistently comprise a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include compensation expenses for employees in our sales and marketing departments  third party advertising expenses  as well as sales commissions and sales agency fees 
research and development expenses relate to the development of new software and the modification of the formulation existing software 
we expense such costs as they are incurred 
taxes except for certain hardware procurement and resale transactions  we conduct substantially all of our business through our chinese subsidiaries  which are generally subject to a state corporate income tax and a local income tax 
under the income tax laws of china  foreign invested enterprises  or fies  satisfying certain criteria can enjoy preferential tax treatment 
our subsidiaries  asiainfo technologies  asiainfo management and asiainfo technologies chengdu  inc  are fies and enjoy certain preferential tax treatments in china 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for details of the respective preferential treatments for each of these subsidiaries 
the unified chinese corporate income tax laws for domestic enterprises and fies will likely take effect in it is anticipated that these unified tax laws will eliminate various preferential tax provisions in china 
however  such unified tax laws should not affect the preferential tax treatments granted to fies in the previous years 
sales of hardware procured in china are subject to a value added tax 
most of our sales of hardware procured outside china are made through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc and thus are not subject to the value added tax 
we effectively pass value added taxes on hardware sales through to our customers and do not include them in revenues reported in our financial statements 
in addition  companies that develop their own software and have the software registered with the relevant authorities in china are generally entitled to a value added tax refund 
if the net amount of the value added tax payable exceeds of software sales  the excess portion of the value added tax is refundable immediately 
this policy is effective until we are also subject to us income taxes on revenues generated in the united states  including revenues from our limited hardware procurement activities through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc  and interest income earned in the united states 
foreign exchange a majority of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the software and service components of our business are denominated in renminbi 
the value of our shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or other business expansion 
we actively monitor our exposure to these risks and adjust our cash position in the renminbi and the us dollar when we believe such adjustments will reduce risks 
for example  in february we exchanged approximately million cash in us dollar into renminbi 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues and cost of revenues under customer contracts  warranty obligations  bad debts  income taxes  investment in affiliate  goodwill and other intangible assets  and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally charge a fixed price for all of our projects and recognize revenue based on the percentage of completion of the project 
software revenues from customer orders requiring significant production  modifications  or customization of the software are recognized over the installation and customization period 
we use labor costs and direct project expenses to determine the stage of completion  except for revenue associated with the procurement of hardware  which we recognize upon delivery of the hardware to the customer 
since a large part of the cost of certain projects  particularly network solutions projects  often relates to hardware  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly gross revenue and inventory level to fluctuate significantly 
however  those fluctuations do not significantly affect our gross profits because hardware related revenues generally approximate the costs of the hardware 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to adjustments in current periods as the contract progresses to completion 
accordingly  any changes in our estimates would impact our future operating results 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge if the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets is less than its recorded amount 
as required under sfas no  during the first quarter of we completed an annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million relating to the goodwill and acquired intangible assets primarily attributable to our acquisition of bonson in february of the impairment resulted primarily from the industry wide equity devaluations of the past year 
continued deterioration of market conditions may require us to record additional impairment charges in the future 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues  including hardware pass through  decreased to million in  from million in revenues net of hardware costs decreased approximately to million in software revenue was million  representing a decrease from million in network solution revenue net of hardware cost was million  representing an decrease from million in the decrease in our total revenues was primarily attributable to the business slowdown caused by the sars outbreak in  as well as our continued focus on providing software solutions which effectively reduces our revenues from hardware pass through 
looking forward  we anticipate that our net revenues will increase to in  driven by the growth we anticipate in revenues from our software solutions  including revenues related to the hrm and bi business we acquired in december cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues was million in  remaining at approximately the same level as due to the fixed nature of our compensation expenses 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased in to million 
gross profit as a percentage of gross revenues  or gross margin  decreased to in  as compared to in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  as compared to in these decreases in margins were primarily attributable to the fixed nature of the compensation expenses that form a significant aspect of our costs of revenues 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of our recording the impairment charges discussed below 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was partially attributable to our consolidation of sales operations and our increased sales efficiency as a result of our operations restructure effective july  that focuses our business operation on specific customers rather than product lines 
instead of selling our products and services through the two former strategic business units  communications solutions and operation support systems solutions  we now have one point of sales contact for each of our major customers  streamlining the relationships and interactions with our customers 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in  largely as a result of increased bad debt expenses in the amount of million 
research and development expenses increased to million in  from million in  due to our continued focus on developing new software products and solutions for china s telecommunications carriers 
we intend to continue to increase our investment in research and development to introduce new products and services in a timely manner to our customers 
in  we conducted impairment tests regarding the goodwill recorded in our acquisition of bonson in based on these tests  we recorded approximately million in impairment charges in connection with our acquisition of bonson 
equity in loss of affiliates 
equity in loss of affiliate in of approximately million represented an impairment charge related to our investment in  as well as our proportionate share of losses incurred by  intrinsic holdings  in which we hold a minority stake 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in connection with our investment in intrinsic based on an impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter of net income loss 
our net loss was million in  or a loss of per share on a fully diluted basis  as compared to net income of million in  or income of per share on a fully diluted basis 
the impairment charges from our acquisition of bonson and our investment in intrinsic  described above  reduced our earnings in by per share 
we expect net income in to be between million to million or to per basic share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues  including hardware pass through  decreased to million in  from million in revenues net of hardware costs decreased approximately to million in network solutions revenues net of hardware costs were million in  a decrease from the previous year 
software solutions revenues were million in  representing of total revenues net of hardware costs and a increase over software solutions revenues from the previous year 
the decrease in total revenues was primarily attributable to a shift in our customer s focus from increasing network capacity to increasing network productivity through the provision of more advanced applications  as well as our shift in focus to high end systems integration projects involving less hardware pass through revenue 
the decrease in net revenues was attributable to the prolonged telecommunications industry restructuring in china resulting in an estimated decrease of total capital expenditure in on the part of telecommunications carriers in china 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues decreased to million in  partially as a result of more customers purchasing hardware directly from hardware vendors 
our cost of revenues net of hardware costs increased to million in while our revenues net of hardware cost decreased 
this was primarily due to the increased number of employees in our former bss oss solutions business unit and lower margins on hardware pass through 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased in to million 
gross profit as a percentage of gross revenues  or gross margin  increased to in  as compared to in the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the smaller amount of low margin hardware pass through revenue recognized in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  as compared to in  primarily due to the increased number of employees in our former bss oss solutions business unit and lower margins on hardware pass through 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased to million in  from million in these decreases resulted from cost cutting measures implemented during the year  including a headcount decrease and a salary cut for employees at the manager level and above 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was partially attributable to the integration of our sales teams within our former communications solutions business unit  the integration of bonson s sales team into our former bss oss solutions business unit  reductions in staff  reduced efforts in international and channel sales  and tighter control of our marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in  from million in research and development expenses increased to million in  from million in  due to our continued focus on developing new software products and solutions for china s telecommunications carriers 
we recognized a charge of million for amortization of intangible assets in related to our acquisition of bonson 
other income expenses 
other income expenses  consisting primarily of net interest income and expense  decreased from income of approximately million in to income of million in  partially due to a decrease in interest rates and our having less cash on our balance sheet as a result of our acquisition of bonson 
the decrease was also due to our recording a provision of million against a promissory note receivable the collection of which we determined to be not reasonably assured 
minority interest 
in  minority interest of million represented the portion of our loss before minority interests attributable to the minority shareholders of two of our subsidiaries  marsec and guangdong wangying information technology co 
ltd  or guangdong wangying 
equity in loss of affiliates 
equity in loss of affiliate in of approximately million included our proportionate share of the loss incurred by intrinsic  in which we held a equity interest  as well as an impairment charge of approximately million we recorded in connection with that investment 
net income loss 
net income decreased to million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  from million  or per share on a fully diluted basis in bonson contributed of total net income in selected unaudited quarterly combined results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the four quarters ended december  and we believe this unaudited information has been prepared substantially on the same basis as the annual audited combined financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe this data includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation 
you should read the quarterly data together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the consolidated results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period

we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
we have historically financed our working capital and other financing requirements through careful management of our billing cycle  private placements of equity securities  our initial public offering in march of and  to a limited extent  bank loans 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  consisting of million in billed receivables and million in unbilled receivables 
our billed receivables are based on revenue we have booked and billed 
our unbilled receivables are based on revenue we have booked through the percentage completion method  but for which we have not yet billed the customer 
for example  we recognize revenues for hardware pass through at the time the hardware is accepted by the customer  based on the cost of the underlying hardware 
however  our contracts with our customers will often allow the customers to withhold of the total contract payments until final project acceptance  which on average is eight to nine months after hardware delivery 
as a result  revenues from hardware pass through generally represent a significant portion of our unbilled receivables and can cause the aging of these receivables to be relatively long 
at december   our days sales outstanding were days  as compared to days as of the end of the third quarter 
our billed receivables were days sales outstanding and our unbilled receivables were days sales outstanding 
the lower days sales outstanding was attributable to our increased collection efficiency 
as of december   we had short term credit facilities for working capital purposes totaling million  expiring in december   which were secured by bank deposits of million 
the unused portion of these facilities was million  with million having been used as security for issuing standby letters of credit and notes payable to hardware suppliers and customers 
additional bank deposits of million were used for issuing standby letters of credit and bank acceptance drafts as of december  one of our subsidiaries  asiainfo management  has outstanding borrowings of million in rmb  for which its assets are pledged as security 
the loan to asiainfo management bears interest at a rate of per annum and is repayable within one year 
bank deposits pledged as security for our bank loans and short term credit facilities totaled million as of december   and are presented as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we were committed under certain operating leases  requiring annual minimum rentals of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we ended the year with a cash position of million  of which million was in short term investments  million was in restricted cash and million was in cash and cash equivalents 
restricted cash consists of million used to secure our million credit facility  million used as security for issuing standby letters of credit and bank acceptance drafts and million held by asiainfo management and pledged as security for bank guarantees 
our short term investments feature fixed income  liquidity and low risk 
the cash equivalents include investments in cash management accounts to enhance our interest income 
our inventory position at the end of was approximately million  down million as compared to the beginning of the year 
this decrease was attributable our strategy of increasing our focus on our software solutions business  which typically does not involve hardware pass through 
we anticipate that the net proceeds of our initial public offering in march  together with available funds and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion through we may need to raise additional funds in the future  however  in order to fund acquisitions  develop new or enhanced services or products  respond to competitive pressures to compete successfully for larger projects involving higher levels of hardware purchases  or if our business otherwise grows more rapidly than we currently predict 
if we do need to raise additional funds  we expect to raise those funds through new issuances of shares of our equity securities in one or more public offerings or private placements  or through credit facilities extended by lending institutions 
in the event that we decide to pay dividends to our shareholders  our ability to pay dividends will depend in part on our ability to receive dividends from our operating subsidiaries in china 
foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from our operating subsidiaries in china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements with any individuals or entities

certain risks that may affect our operating results and our common stock in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and our future prospects the growth of our business is dependent on government telecommunications infrastructure and budgetary policies  particularly the allocation of funds to sustain the growth of the telecommunications industry in china 
most of our large customers are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the government of china 
accordingly  their business strategies  capital expenditure budgets and spending plans are largely decided in accordance with government policies  which  in turn  are determined on a centralized basis at the highest level by the national development and reform commission of china 
as a result  the growth of our business is heavily dependent on government policies for telecommunications and internet infrastructure 
insufficient government allocation of funds to sustain the growth of china s telecommunications industries in the future could reduce the demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
on december   in an effort to increase the efficiency of telecommunications service providers through competition  the state council of china announced that it would split china telecom geographically into a northern division comprising ten provinces and a southern division comprising provinces 
under the state council s plan  the northern division of china telecom has merged with china netcom and jitong communication  and has been renamed china network communications group corporation  or china netcom group  while the southern division operates under the china telecom name 
as a result of the restructuring  new orders for telecommunications infrastructure expansion and improvement projects have decreased over the past several quarters  adversely affecting our backlog and our net revenue 
although we expect that the restructuring will have a positive impact on growth in the telecommunications industry in china in the long term  continued delays in capital expenditure projects could continue to negatively affect our growth in the near term 
in addition  similar restructurings of this nature could cause our operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter in the future 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer significantly 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers  such as china telecom  china unicom  china mobile and china netcom group 
china mobile accounted for of our revenues in the loss  cancellation or deferral of any large contract by any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  and consequently our profits 
our recent acquisition of the human resources management and business intelligence assets of pacific software is part of our strategy to further diversify our business and  therefore  gradually reduce such concentration risk in the future 
however  in the near term  the expected revenue to be generated by our business outside the telecommunications industry is still limited compared to our overall revenues 
moreover  we cannot provide any assurance that a material proportion of our revenues will be derived from other industries in the future 
the long and variable sales cycles for our products and services can cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our services and products involves a significant commitment of its resources and an extended evaluation 
as a result  our sales cycle tends to be lengthy 
we spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about features and applications of our services and products 
because our major customers operate large and complex networks  they usually expand their networks in large increments on a sporadic basis 
the combination of these factors can cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
a large part of the contract amount of our projects usually relates to hardware procurement 
since we recognize most of the revenues relating to hardware plus a portion of services and software revenues at the time of hardware delivery  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly gross revenues to fluctuate significantly 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and should not be relied upon 
it is likely that our operating results in some periods may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will probably decline  perhaps significantly more in percentage terms than any corresponding decline in our operating results 
our working capital requirements may increase significantly 
we typically purchase hardware for our customers as part of our turn key total solutions services 
we generally require our customers to pay to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery 
we typically place orders for hardware against back to back orders from customers and seek favorable payment terms from hardware vendors 
this policy has historically minimized our working capital requirements 
however  for certain large and strategically important projects  we have agreed to payment of less than to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery in order to maintain competitiveness 
wider adoption of less favorable payment terms or delays in hardware deliveries will require us to increase our working capital needs significantly 
we have sustained losses in prior years and may incur slower earnings growth  earnings declines or net losses in the future 
although we had net income in  and  we sustained net losses in  and there are no assurances that we can sustain profitability or avoid net losses in the future 
we continue to expect that certain of our operating expenses will increase as our business grows 
the level of these expenses will be largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage will be fixed 
as a result  any delays in expanding sales volume and generating revenue could result in substantial operating losses 
our high level of fixed costs  as well as increased competition in the software market  could result in reduced operating margins 
we maintain a relatively stable work force of software and network engineers engaged in all phases of planning and executing projects on behalf of our customers 
as a result  our operating costs are relatively fixed from quarter to quarter  regardless of fluctuations in our revenues 
in recent periods  this has resulted in our gross profit decreasing as a percentage of our net revenues 
for example  during the second quarter of our revenues were impacted by the outbreak of sars and our gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to as compared to in the comparable period of future fluctuations in our net revenues could result in similar decreases in our operating margins 
in addition  enhanced competition in the software market and other markets in which we operate could result in reduced prices  which  together with our relatively fixed operating costs  could also result in reduced operating margins 
business acquisitions we undertake may be challenging  and we may realize losses on our investments 
in february of  as a key component of our business and growth strategy  we acquired bonson  a leading provider of operation support system solutions in china 
on december   we completed our acquisition of certain human resources management and business intelligence assets valued at approximately million from pacific software china limited  a privately held  medium sized software solutions company based in hong kong  and from its affiliate  new century pacific software beijing limited  a wholly foreign owned enterprise based in beijing  china 
in the future  we may acquire other companies or assets that we feel will enhance our revenue growth  operations and profitability 
such acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash and dilutive issuances of our common stock 
such acquisitions involve other significant risks  including 
the difficulties of integrating  assimilating and managing the operations  technologies  intellectual property  products and personnel of the acquired business  
the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  
the additional expense associated with acquired contingent liabilities  
the loss of key employees in acquired businesses  and 
the risk of being sued by terminated employees and contractors 
we will need to integrate and manage any businesses we determine to acquire in the future 
our failure to do so successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
asset impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
which requires us  among other things  to review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually 
in connection with our business acquisitions  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the related useful lives of those assets  we have to make assumptions regarding their fair value  our recoverability of those assets and our ability to successfully develop and ultimately commercialize acquired technology 
if those assumptions change in the future when we conduct our periodic reviews in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million as a result of an independent valuation during the first quarter of of the goodwill and acquired intangible assets mainly attributable to our acquisition of bonson in february in december we recorded an impairment charge of us million related to our investment in intrinsic 
there is no assurance that future reviews will not result in further write downs to goodwill and other intangible assets 
severe acute respiratory syndrome may have an impact on our business the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  is believed to have started in guangdong province  china in late and to have later spread to beijing 
the sars outbreak impacted our second quarter revenues by disrupting travel throughout china and causing serious delays in service delivery to our customers 
the outbreak also interrupted our collection efforts  causing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding to increase 
although the spread of sars in china appears to have been contained and our business activities resumed normal operations throughout the third and fourth quarters of  the medical community worldwide has not fully understood the origin of sars and has not found a well recognized effective treatment for sars 
as a consequence  the potential long term effects of sars on economic growth in china are still unknown 
since january   a small number of new sars cases have been reported in china 
any worsening of the sars epidemic could have an adverse impact on our business 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
each of our executive officers is responsible for an important segment of our operations 
although we believe that we have significant depth at all levels of management  the loss of any of our executive officers services could be detrimental to our operations 
we do not have  and do not plan to obtain  key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we face a competitive labor market in china for skilled personnel and therefore are highly dependent on the skills and services of our existing key skilled personnel and our ability to hire additional skilled employees 
competition for highly skilled software design  engineering and sales and marketing personnel is intense in china 
our failure to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth 
competition for skilled personnel comes primarily from a wide range of foreign companies active in china  many of which have substantially greater resources than we have 
limitations on our ability to hire and train a sufficient number of personnel at all levels would limit our ability to undertake projects in the future and could cause us to lose market share 
we extend warranties to our customers that expose us to potential liabilities 
we customarily provide our customers with one to three year warranties  under which we agree to maintain installed systems at no additional cost to our customers 
the maintenance services cover both hardware and our proprietary and third party software products 
although we seek to arrange back to back warranties with hardware and software vendors  we have the primary responsibility to maintain the installed hardware and software 
our contracts do not have disclaimers or limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages  nor do we cap the amounts our customers can recover for damages 
in addition  we do not currently maintain any insurance policy with respect to our exposure to warranty claims 
the failure of our installed projects to operate properly could give rise to substantial liability for special  consequential or incidental damages  that in turn could materially and adversely affect us 
we sell our services on a fixed price  fixed time basis which exposes us to risks associated with cost overruns and delays 
we sell most of our services on a fixed price  fixed time basis 
in contracts with our customers  we typically agree to pay late completion fines of up to of the total contract value 
in large scale telecommunications infrastructure projects  there are many factors beyond our control which could cause delays or cost overruns 
in this event  we would be exposed to cost overruns and liable for late completion fines 
we may become less competitive if we are unable to develop or acquire new products  or enhancements to our existing products  that are marketable on a timely and cost effective basis 
our future operating results will depend  to a significant extent  upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to introduce new products and services to meet the requirements of our customers in a rapidly developing and evolving market 
for example  we continually develop new services and software products for our customers in the telecommunications market 
if we do not enhance our existing products and services or introduce new successful products and services in a timely manner  our products and services may become obsolete  and our revenues and operating results may suffer 
moreover  unexpected technical  operational  distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of any products or services that we may plan to introduce in the future 
we cannot be sure that any of these products and services will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenues 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of poor enforcement of intellectual property rights in china 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our intellectual property rights  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality arrangements and copyright and trademark registrations 
we have registered some marks and filed trademark applications for other marks with the united states patent and trademark office  the trademark bureau of the state administration of industry and commerce in china and the trade marks registry in hong kong 
we have also registered copyrights with the state copyright bureau in china with respect to certain of our software products  although we have not applied for copyright protection elsewhere including the united states 
despite these precautions  the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in china is weak 
moreover  bonson  which we acquired in february   had never registered copyrights for its software products prior to the acquisition 
because the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited 
we do not own any patents and have not filed any patent applications  as we do not believe that the benefits of patent protection outweigh the costs of filing and updating patents for our software products 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees and consultants  and control access to  and distribution of  our documentation and other licensed information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our licensed services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our licensed technology is difficult and there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
a portion of our business involves the development and customization of software applications for customers 
we generally retain significant ownership or rights to use and market such software for other customer projects  where possible 
however  our customers sometimes retain co ownership and rights to use the applications  processes  and intellectual property so developed 
in some cases  we may have no right or only limited rights to reuse or provide these developments in projects involving other customers 
to the extent that we are unable to negotiate contracts which permit us to reuse source codes and methodologies  or to the extent that we have conflicts with our customers regarding our ability to do so  we may be unable to provide similar solutions to our other customers 
we are exposed to certain business and litigation risks with respect to technology rights held by third parties 
we currently license technology from third parties and intend to do so increasingly in the future as we introduce services that require new technology 
there can be no assurance that these technology licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay or compromise our ability to introduce new services 
in addition  we may or may allegedly breach the technology rights of others and incur legal expenses and damages  which could be substantial 
investors may not be able to enforce judgments by united states courts against certain of our officers and directors 
we are incorporated in the state of delaware 
however  a majority of our directors and executive officers  and certain of our principal shareholders  live outside of the united states  principally in beijing and hong kong 
as a result  you may not be able to 
effect service of process upon those persons within the united states  or 
enforce against those persons judgments obtained in united states courts  including judgments relating to the federal securities laws of the united states 
we do not intend to pay and may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain future earnings to fund our growth 
furthermore  if we decide to pay dividends  foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
the fact that our business is conducted in both us dollars and renminbi may subject us to currency exchange rate risk due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between those two currencies 
substantially all of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in either us dollars or renminbi 
as a result  we are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between those currencies 
because of the unitary exchange rate system introduced in china on january   the official bank exchange rate for conversion of renminbi to us dollars experienced a devaluation of approximately 
we report our financial results in us dollars  therefore  any future devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar may have an adverse effect on our reported net income 
substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to the software and services component of our business are denominated in renminbi 
the value of our shares may be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or other business expansion 
the markets in which we sell our services and products are competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
our main domestic competitors in china are digital china  linkage  neusoft  and wholewise 
our international competitors include multinational companies such as ibm global services  hp services  oracle  sibel  convergys and sap  who are establishing more active presences in the it services market for china s telecommunications industry 
in addition  top international consulting companies such as pricewaterhousecoopers  deloitte touche tohmatsu  ernst young  accenture  and kpmg  have also entered china s it services market 
in the human resources management and business intelligence software sector  our competitors include large international information technology companies such as sap  oracle  ibm and peoplesoft  as well as domestic players such as ufsoft 
our competitors  some of whom have greater financial  technical and human resources than we have  may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of new products or services 
it is possible that competition in the form of new competitors or alliances  joint ventures or consolidation among existing competitors may decrease our market share 
increased competition could result in lower personnel utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our profits and overall financial condition 
political and economic policies of the chinese government could affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
since the establishment of the people s republic of china in  the communist party has been the governing political party in china 
the highest bodies of leadership are the politburo of the communist party  the central committee and the national people s congress 
the state council  which is the highest institution of government administration  reports to the national people s congress and has under its supervision various commissions  agencies and ministries  including the ministry of information industry  the telecommunications regulatory body of the chinese government 
since the late s  the chinese government has been reforming the chinese economic system 
although we believe that economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the chinese government have had and will continue to have a positive effect on economic development in china  there can be no assurance that the economic reform strategy will not from time to time be modified or revised 
such modifications or revisions  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and investment in the internet and the telecommunications industry in china 
such developments could reduce  perhaps significantly  the demand for our products and services 
furthermore  changes in political  economic and social conditions in china  adjustments in policies of the chinese government or changes in laws and regulations could adversely affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
high technology and emerging market shares have historically experienced extreme volatility and may subject you to losses 
the trading price of our shares may be subject to significant market volatility due to investor perceptions of investments relating to china and asia  as well as developments in the telecommunications industry 
in addition  the high technology sector of the stock market frequently experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become subject to securities litigation  which is expensive and could result in a diversion of resources 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past  and we are currently involved in this type of litigation as a result of allegedly improper allocation procedures relating to the sale of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering in march of for more information on that litigation  please see the discussion under the heading item legal proceedings in part i of this report 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
future sales of shares by existing shareholders could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
a small number of shareholders controls us 
a small number of shareholders  including warburg pincus ventures  and their affiliates  as well as edward tian  one of our directors  james ding  our chairman  and several of our other directors and officers control approximately of our voting stock 
as a result  these shareholders collectively are able to control all matters requiring shareholder approval  including election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a sale of our assets and the terms of future equity financings 
the combined voting power of our large shareholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could prevent a change of control and prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium on their common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock 
without any further vote or action on the part of our stockholders  the board of directors has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if it is ever issued  may have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of our common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  such an issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have authorized the size of our board of directors to be not less than three nor more than nine directors 
the terms of the office of the nine member board of directors have been divided into three classes class i  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held in  class ii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in  and class iii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in this classification of the board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date when the person became an interested stockholder unless  subject to exceptions  the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner 
generally  a business combination includes a merger  asset or stock sale  or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder  and an interested stockholder includes any person that is the owner of or more of our outstanding voting stock or is an affiliate or associate of ours 
our change of control severance agreements with executive officers may discourage a change of control recently we have entered into change of control severance agreements with several of our executive officers 
these agreements provide  among other things  that the executive officers would be entitled to various benefits upon the occurrence of either a covered termination as defined therein or a change of control as defined therein  including payment of one year of base salary and bonus  immediate vesting of of any outstanding unvested stock options held by the executive officer and provisions of medical benefits and housing allowance 
the potential obligations to pay the executive officers the above amounts may discourage a potential acquiror from effecting a change of control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily associated with our cash  short term investments and short term bank loans 
to date  we have not entered into any types of derivatives to hedge against interest rate changes 
we are exposed to exchange rate risk in connection with the relative value of the us dollar and the renminbi 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the service and software components of our business are denominated in renminbi 
we maintain a significant portion of our cash deposits in us dollars to avoid currency risk related to renminbi 
a portion of these us dollar deposits are used to collateralize renminbi denominated loans from chinese banks 
the value of our shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or business expansion 
we actively monitor our exposure to these risks and adjust our cash position in the renminbi and the us dollar when we believe such adjustments will reduce our risk 
for example  in february we exchanged approximately million cash in us dollar into renminbi 
there have been no significant changes in our exposure to changes in either interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december  our exposure to interest rates is limited as we do not have variable rate and long term borrowings 
we are subject to variable interest rates on our bank deposits that are short term investments 
as there are no significant market price movements  such investments are held at cost 
as of december   a hypothetical immediate increase or decrease in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately or decrease our annual interest income by approximately  respectively
