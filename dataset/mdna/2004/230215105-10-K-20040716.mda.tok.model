offshore upholstery fabric sourcing the company has undertaken several initiatives to source and market upholstery fabrics produced internationally  primarily in asia 
these measures are part of the company s continuing efforts to meet consumer preferences for certain types of fabrics  as well as to serve the growing segment of the company s customer base that is establishing or expanding furniture production in international areas 
in fiscal  the company sourced of its upholstery fabrics offshore  a figure that nearly tripled from for fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  of the company s upholstery fabrics were sourced outside the united states 
the growth in offshore sourcing is a trend that is expected to continue 
a major component of the company s offshore sourcing effort is its china operation  which was announced in march and began operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal this initiative involves a strategy to link the company s existing customer relationships  design expertise and production technology with low cost fabric manufacturing in china  while continuing to maintain high quality standards 
the company has leased and upfitted a  square foot facility in the shanghai region of china  where fabrics sourced in asia will be inspected and tested to assure compliance with the company s quality standards before shipment to customers 
in most cases  additional value added finishing steps are applied to the fabrics in china before shipment 
incoming fabric inspection  testing and finishing operations began during the fourth quarter 
as expected  the company has experienced moderate operating losses in its china operations in fiscal  and some level of operating loss may continue until some time in fiscal other corporate expenses selling  general and administrative expenses

fiscal cdf restructuring 
the restructuring and related charges for cdf reflect the restructuring initiative announced in august the objectives of this initiative were to lower manufacturing costs  simplify the dobby fabric upholstery line  increase asset utilization and enhance the division s manufacturing competitive position 
this restructuring plan principally involved consolidation of the division s weaving  finishing  yarn making and distribution operations by closing the facility located in chattanooga  tennessee and integrating these functions into cdf s pageland  south carolina  graham  north carolina and burlington  north carolina plants  a significant reduction in the number of stock keeping units skus offered in the dobby product line  representing about of the finished goods skus but only of sales  and a net reduction in workforce of approximately positions 
exit of wet printed flock product line 
during march  the company announced that it was evaluating strategic alternatives for the capital invested in its wet printed flock upholstery fabrics product line 
management took this action because of the significant decline in sales and profitability of wet printed flocks in recent years  a decline related principally to the strength of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies as well as a shift in consumer preferences to other styles of upholstery fabrics 
in april  management approved a plan to exit the wet printed flock upholstery fabric business and has been actively seeking to sell the assets related to this product line 
the exit plan involved closing a printing facility and flocking operation within the culp velvets prints division  a reduction in related selling and administrative expenses  and termination of employees

during fiscal and continuing into fiscal  the company undertook a restructuring plan in its upholstery fabric segment intended to lower operating expenses  increase manufacturing utilization  raise productivity and position the company to operate profitably on a lower level of sales 
the plan involved the consolidation of certain fabric manufacturing capacity within the culp decorative fabrics cdf division  closing one of the company s four yarn manufacturing plants within culp yarn  an extensive reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses including the termination of employees and a comprehensive stock keeping unit sku reduction initiative related to finished goods and raw materials in cdf 
additionally  the plan included consolidation of the cdf design operation into the company s design center and the implementation of a common set of raw material components for cdf 
the company also recognized certain inventory write downs related to the closed facilities as part of this initiative 
the total charge from the restructuring  cost reduction and inventory write down initiatives was million  about million of which represented non cash items 
in fiscal the company recognized million of restructuring and related charges recorded as million in the line item restructuring expense and million in cost of sales

mattress fabrics segment net sales 
mattress ticking sales for fiscal decreased to million 
sales to us bedding manufacturers fell to million  while sales to international customers increased by to million 
the overall sales decrease was principally due to the weakness in consumer demand for mattresses 
additional factors that could have affected ticking demand for the company s products from bedding manufacturers are the gradual shift by many customers to one sided mattresses  which generally require one third less mattress ticking and a growing consumer preference at the higher end of the bedding market for knitted tickings which the company does not manufacture rather than woven or printed tickings although the company has begun to source knitted tickings from an outside supplier 
gross profit 
for fiscal  the mattress fabric segment reported gross profit dollars and margins of million and  respectively  compared with million and for fiscal the principal reasons for the decline were lower sales volume and reduced production schedules  which resulted in less absorption of fixed costs  pricing pressures related to the overall competitive situation in the bedding industry  and the high cost of a european sourcing agreement 
culp home fashions entered into an agreement with a european supplier in october as part of the termination of a long term supply relationship 
the agreement required  among other things  that the company maintain a certain level of weekly purchases through the end of the second quarter of fiscal consequently  during the first and second quarters of fiscal  the company was required to source products from this supplier that were significantly more expensive than products manufactured at the company s us and canadian plants in order to meet the agreement s minimum purchase levels 
this supply agreement was concluded on october  upholstery fabrics segment net sales 
upholstery fabric sales for fiscal decreased to million 
domestic upholstery fabric sales decreased million  or  to million  due primarily to overall weakness in consumer demand for upholstered furniture  and other factors discussed below 
international sales decreased to million  due primarily to the exiting of the wet printed flock fabric business in april in addition to the overall softness in demand during fiscal  the sales decrease in upholstery fabrics was attributable to the company s strategy to focus on improving the profitability of its sales mix by reducing or eliminating products generating little or no profit 
in the culp velvets prints division  the company discontinued its unprofitable wet printed flock business at the end of fiscal this product line produced annual sales in fiscal of approximately million with approximately million in operating losses 
the company believes upholstery fabric sales were also impacted in fiscal by an increasing market share of leather furniture being sold in the us  and an increase in imported fabrics  both in piece goods and cut and sewn kits 
gross profit 
in spite of weak furniture demand and the operational disruption in connection with the fiscal cdf restructuring  the upholstery fabric segment improved its gross profit dollars and margins in fiscal gross profit for fiscal was million  or  versus million  or  for fiscal restructuring related charges of million and million were included in gross profit for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the key factors behind this improvement were a more profitable sales mix  the elimination of losses related to the wet printed flock business  the increasing productivity benefits from the cdf restructuring  and the fixed cost reduction benefits from the closing of the chattanooga plant as part of the fiscal cdf restructuring 
other corporate expenses selling  general and administrative expenses

interest expense for fiscal declined to million from million for fiscal due to significantly lower borrowings outstanding  offset somewhat by a  increase in interest expense associated with the company s million term loan  as a result of an amendment in february interest income 
interest income for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due to significantly higher average invested cash for the year as compared with the average for fiscal other expense 
other expense for the fiscal totaled  compared with million for fiscal the decrease was principally due to lower legal and debt issue expenses 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal the higher rate on the pretax loss in each period reflects the benefit from a reduction in estimated accruals as well as a lower proportion of earnings in fiscal from the company s canadian subsidiary that is taxed at a lower effective rate 
handling costs the company records warehousing costs in selling  general administrative expenses 
these costs were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
warehousing costs include the operating expenses of the company s various finished goods distribution centers  such as personnel costs  utilities  building rent and material handling equipment lease expense

financing arrangements strengthening the consolidated balance sheet was an important focus for the company in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the company made a million prepayment on its million of outstanding senior notes 
as part of the transaction  the company negotiated a five percent  or million  premium to be paid to the current note holders for the prepayment of this principal amount 
this premium amount  along with other related transaction costs  resulted in a charge of million  or per share  in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of this prepayment  the company will realize annualized savings of approximately million  or per share  in net interest expense in each of the next two years  and a declining amount over the reminder of the notes term until in addition  the company s long term debt to capital ratio improved to at may  compared with at the end of fiscal during the past four years  the company has generated sufficient cash flow from operations to reduce long term debt by million 
the company s remaining million in long term debt is unsecured and is comprised of million in outstanding senior notes from several insurance companies  with a fixed interest rate of  and a million  non interest bearing term loan with the canadian government 
additionally  the company has a million revolving credit line with a bank  including letters of credit up to million

depreciation expense for fiscal was million 
for fiscal  the company s capital expenditure budget is million  of which million is related to the company s purchase and renovation of a new corporate headquarters building 
depreciation expense for fiscal is estimated to be comparable with fiscal inflation the cost of certain of the company s raw materials  principally fibers from petroleum derivatives  and utility energy costs  have increased during the past few months due to rising oil prices  but overall operating expenses are remaining generally stable 
factors that reasonably can be expected to influence margins in the future include changes in raw material prices  trends in other operating costs and overall competitive conditions 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of may   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million and from bedding manufacturers approximately million 
approximately million of the company s total accounts receivable was due from international customers 
additionally  as of may   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
the company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventory valuation 
the company operates as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to write downs of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory write downs is the age of the inventory 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation write downs based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine and twelve month categories 
while management believes that adequate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
long lived assets 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective april  sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and also resolves implementation issues related to sfas adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
management reviews long lived assets  which consists of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
the company s assessment at may  indicated that the net undiscounted future operating cash flows of the company s businesses were sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived assets under sfas no 
the determination of future operating cash flows involves considerable estimation and judgment about future market conditions and future sales and profitability 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
goodwill 
as of april   culp adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for the initial application of sfas no 
 an independent business valuation specialist was engaged to assist the company in the determination of the fair market value of culp decorative fabrics  one of the company s two divisions within the upholstery fabric segment  because of the significance of the goodwill associated with the division and due to its operating performance 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non operating  non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million net of taxes of million  or per share diluted  related to the goodwill associated with the culp decorative fabrics division 
after the goodwill impairment charge  the company s remaining goodwill relates to the following divisions culp decorative fabrics million and culp home fashions million 
the company updated its goodwill impairment test as of may  this impairment test  which was prepared by the company with assistance from an independent business valuation specialist  did not indicate any further impairment of goodwill 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimation and judgment 
in particular  determining the fair value of a business unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
as a result of a continuing difficult business environment  there is a potential for further impairment of the goodwill of culp decorative fabrics 
restructuring charges 
the upholstery fabric industry continues to be under significant pressure from a variety of external forces  such as an increase in the market share of leather furniture  an increase in customers buying fabric and cut and sew fabric kits from china  increasing pricing demands  global competition and the overall weakness of the economy 
in an effort to reduce operating expenses and increase manufacturing utilization  the company has undertaken four restructuring initiatives  three within culp decorative fabrics  and one related to the exit of the wet printed flock product line  which was part of the culp velvets prints division within the upholstery fabric segment  which have resulted in restructuring charges related to the remaining lease costs of the closed facilities  the write down of property  plant and equipment and workforce reduction 
severance and related charges and facility exit costs  including those related to leases  were accounted for under eitf  the then currently effective accounting literature 
asset impairment charges related to the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities are based on an estimate of expected sales prices for the real estate and equipment 
the company reassesses the individual accrual requirements at the end of each reporting period 
if circumstances change  causing current estimates to differ from original estimates  adjustments are recorded in the period of change 
restructuring charges  and adjustments of those charges  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management continues to monitor and assess sales trends in the culp decorative fabrics division 
if sales declines continue  management may need to take further actions to adjust cost structures and capacity  in addition to those taken in recent years 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for certain qualifying employee termination benefits 
this statement became effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
no valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the company s deferred tax assets 
management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
considerable judgment is involved in this process as ultimate realization of benefits is dependent on the generation of future taxable income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company s exposure to floating debt interest rate risk was eliminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal after the remaining industrial revenue bonds were paid 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is due primarily to a foreign subsidiary domiciled in canada and firmly committed and anticipated purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials in foreign currencies 
the company s canadian subsidiary uses the united states dollar as its functional currency 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with the canadian subsidiary 
however  the company generally enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a hedge against its exposure to currency fluctuations on firmly committed and anticipated purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials 
the amount of canadian denominated sales and manufacturing costs is not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  a change in the exchange rate at may  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
due to the start up of operations in china  the company does have exposure to fluctuations in currency rates if china allows their currency to float since it has been essentially fixed in relation to the us dollar 
currently  the risk cannot be hedged 
the amount of sales and manufacturing costs denominated in chinese currency is not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  a change in the exchange rate at may  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
