item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with forward looking information and factors affecting future performance beginning on page compared to overview american science and engineering  inc develops and manufactures state of the art x ray inspection systems for homeland security and other critical defense applications 
as e continues to innovate  create and develop new products by investing in new ideas through research and development  and evolving its technology to meet the needs of an ever changing world 
the company s primary technologies are as follows z backscatter technology which is used to detect plastic explosives  illegal drugs  and other contraband even when artfully concealed in complex backgrounds by terrorists and smugglers  shaped energy x ray inspection systems which combine the material discrimination features of z backscatter with the penetration capability of high energy x rays for dense cargos  and the manufacture of linear accelerators for a variety of applications including medical  scientific  security  electron beam curing and non destructive testing 
in recent years  the company has focused on right sizing its organization in response to the changes in the global economy and the demands of the security markets that have changed dramatically since september  in addition to adjusting its production capacities  the company has also focused on the recruitment of a senior management team that could continue to enhance the company s operating results  as well as its position in the market place

in fiscal year  the company had sales to one major customer  which accounted for of total sales 
cost of sales and contracts of  in fiscal increased by  or from the previous year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the revenue increase noted above  the recognition of a  loss on contract programs  offset by the lower cost of goods sold related to the nine mobilesearch units and improved service margins as the company entered into several large service contracts in the current fiscal year as warranties expired and the replacement of certain unprofitable service contracts and time and material service arrangements 
included in cost of sales and contracts in fiscal is a  provision for inventory obsolescence 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  were  less than the previous year and represented of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this reduction from the prior year relates to lower consulting costs and reduced expanded demonstration expenditures 
in fiscal  the company had an expanded demonstration tour with a mobilesearch system that was not repeated in the current year 
these decreases were offset somewhat by the addition of sales and marketing personnel in the current year as well as the severance and other costs incurred related to the termination of the company s chief executive officer 
company funded research and development spending decreased to  in fiscal  a decrease compared to the  spent in fiscal research and development spending was of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal in fiscal  the company continued to work to control its research and development spending while continuing to focus on specific initiatives such as the shaped energy gantry system  which was completed in fiscal  the z backscatter van  of which the first four units were shipped in the current year and radiation threat detection technology 
other income expense was  in expense in fiscal as compared to  in income in fiscal in may of  the company closed on a private placement offering of common stock and warrants 
a total of  shares were sold to accredited investors at a price of each 
proceeds from this offering were used in part to pay off the company s line of credit resulting in a decrease in interest expense of  in fiscal in addition  warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a price of were issued

in fiscal  the company recognized  of tax benefit related to a tax refund from prior years 
the company reported net income of  in fiscal as compared to a net loss of  in fiscal compared to overview results of operations net sales and contract revenues decreased by  or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal the decrease in revenues was due primarily to a decrease of approximately  to  in sales of cargosearch systems and upgrades  as numerous projects ongoing in fiscal were completed in the current year and new engagements experienced significant delays as government agencies both us and foreign worked to determine the best solution for security in the post september th environment 
in addition  a significant project to install a cargosearch system in the middle east was halted during the iraqi conflict resulting in lower than anticipated fourth quarter revenues 
in contrast  parcelsearch sales increased by  to  due to an immediate increase in demand following september th that resulted in higher parcelsearch system sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal the third and fourth quarters of fiscal showed slightly lower parcelsearch revenues but still remain higher than the average pre september th levels 
the sale of aftermarket parts remained relatively consistent year over year at approximately million 
aftermarket field services revenues increased by to  as compared to  in fiscal as a result of new post warranty service contracts on installed machines 
service revenues had previously been less than of total revenues and were not separately disclosed  however  due to the increase in the current year are now reflected separately on the company s statement of operations 
the company earned  in contract research and engineering revenues in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the company s hes division increased revenues to external customers by  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal there was a shift in the geographical mix of revenues in fiscal as domestic revenues increased from of total revenues in fiscal to of total revenues in fiscal this increase is due primarily to the domestic focus on homeland defense and security in the wake of the terrorist events of september th 
one customer  an agency of the us government  accounted for of revenues during fiscal cost of sales and contracts of  in fiscal increased by  or from the previous year 
cost of sales and contracts represented of revenues during fiscal  compared to in fiscal this percentage increase in the cost of sales was due primarily to  in provisions for inventory obsolescence recorded in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  excess manufacturing capacity as a result of the sharp decline in cargosearch sales 
the company  in response to the events of september th and the anticipated increase in demand for security systems  had committed to significant volume purchases of raw materials in late fiscal and increased production of cargosearch and parcelsearch systems 
the result was a significant increase in inventory levels at the end of fiscal the events of september th raised considerable interest in the company s products and in the first quarter of fiscal the company signed a three year million blanket purchase agreement with the us department of defense 
this level of interest continued into the second quarter of fiscal as the first orders for three mobilesearch trucks under the blanket purchase agreement were received as well as contracts for two shaped energy cargosearch systems 
despite these facts  however  the level and product mix of orders the company was projecting in late fiscal did not materialize to the levels anticipated 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company experienced a sharp decline in order levels that continued through the fourth quarter and significantly impacted the fourth quarter revenues 
the company continued to complete a certain number of systems  which were in progress despite the lack of related orders  resulting in an increase in finished goods inventory at the end of fiscal as a result of these continued order delays and in conjunction with its budgetary process in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reassessed its expected inventory usage and required reserve levels 
based upon this analysis  the company provided a provision for inventory valued above the lower of its cost or market value or not expected to be utilized within a reasonable period of time 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  were  lower than the previous year and represented of revenues  which was consistent with the prior year 
in fiscal  the company increased its investment in marketing and sales by approximately  by adding personnel and increasing its demo  trade show and road show activities and incurred increases in insurance and consulting costs of approximately  offsetting these costs was a million decrease in legal fees as the result of the settlement of a patent litigation matter that had significant legal costs during fiscal company funded research and development spending decreased to  in fiscal  a decrease compared to the  in spending in fiscal research and development spending in fiscal and fiscal was and of revenues  respectively 
the company had invested significantly in research and development spending in fiscal in the development of new products and product enhancements  most notably its shaped energy technology  as well as product upgrades to improve manufacturability and to address vendor obsolescence issues 
in fiscal  the company worked to control its research and development spending focusing on specific initiatives such as the shaped energy gantry system  the z backscatter van and radiation threat detection technology 
other income expenses was  in income in fiscal as compared to  in expense in fiscal in may of  the company closed on a private placement offering of common stock and warrants 
a total of  shares were sold to accredited investors at a price of each 
proceeds from this offering were used in part to pay off the company s line of credit resulting in a decrease in interest expense of  during the year 
in addition  warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a price of were issued 
these warrants included certain conversion features that require mark to market adjustment that resulted in a credit to other income in the year of million 
the company experienced pre tax operating losses in the current year as a result of the decreased revenue  excess capacity and inventory reserves 
the company has reviewed its deferred tax assets as a whole to determine what would be realized over the next three to five years in light of the historical losses incurred and has recorded a valuation reserve of  against its remaining deferred tax asset at march  the company recorded a net loss of  for fiscal year as compared to a loss of  in the previous year 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at year end increased by  to  at march   compared to  at march  cash flow provided by operations of  was impacted by the following reported net income of  adjusted for non cash items of depreciation and amortization of  provisions for inventory  accounts receivable and warranty reserves of  and a change in the value of warrants issued of a decrease in inventories of  primarily attributable to the shipment of mobilesearch inspection units offset somewhat by increases related to the new zbv product 
an increase in accounts receivable of  from the prior year due to increased revenues reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the milestone billings related to certain fixed price contracts 
net cash of million was provided from investing activities in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures totaled 
million versus million for fiscal investments in fixed assets were comprised primarily of information technology  and furniture and fixtures 
the company invested million in short term investments during the year  and had maturities of million on short term investments 
at year end the company had 
million of restricted cash and investments compared to million in the prior year 
net cash provided by financing activities was million

on august   the company entered into two new credit agreements with silicon valley bank east replacing its hsbc bank usa credit agreements that expired on july  the first agreement is a million domestic loan and security agreement to support the company s routine working capital needs 
maximum borrowings for this line are set at the lower of a the sum of of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus of finished goods inventory up to  or  b million 
the second is a million export loan and security agreement  guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states to support the company s overseas contract  trade finance and working capital needs 
the credit facilities bear an interest rate of the greater of or the silicon valley bank prime rate at march  and have an expiration date of november  the credit agreements are collateralized by certain assets of the company and contain certain restrictions  including limitations on the amount of distributions that can be made to stockholders  the disposition or encumbrances of assets  and require the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
as of march   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
the company has begun the process of renewing these credit facilities with silicon valley bank  but there can be no assurance that silicon valley bank will renew the credit agreements or that alternative financing can be obtained 
management believes the company s working capital requirements through march  can be met without the line of credit 
at march   there were no borrowings outstanding against these credit facilities 
the company had outstanding  in stand by letters of credit guaranteeing performance on certain international projects  which have been collateralized by cash 
no amounts have been drawn on these stand by letters of credit 
on may   the company closed on a private placement offering of common stock and warrants 
a total of  shares were sold to accredited investors at a price of each 
net proceeds to the company approximated million and were used in part to repay million outstanding on the line of credit 
in addition  warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a price of were issued 
these warrants have a five year life  expiring in may the company leases various office and manufacturing facilities under noncancelable operating leases 
future minimum rental payments under the company s operating leases  excluding real estate taxes  insurance and operating costs paid by the company required over the initial terms of the leases are as follows year ending march  in thousands historically  the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures with cash generated by operations  including deposits from customers on long term projects  or from lines of credit available to the company 
the company currently has no debt outstanding and believes that its cash flows from operations and cash on hand are sufficient to meet the current and foreseeable operating requirements of the company s business 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operation 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into purchase orders with its vendors for the purchase of materials or services to meet its production needs 
at march   the company had  of open purchase orders which are expected to be fulfilled within the next twelve to eighteen months 
certain single source vendors or vendors producing custom material require significant lead times from order to delivery of their material 
should the demand for the company s products decline significantly  or should there be a significant shift in the mix of products being demanded  the company may incur cancellation charges  related to these commitments  that could be material to the company s results of operations 
to date  the company has not experienced any material losses related to cancellation penalties 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventories and the related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  warrant liability  and income taxes to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition the company derives a portion of its revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  and scope of each contract 
the fixed site cargosearch systems are sold under fixed price arrangements 
revenue is recognized using percentage of completion accounting  generally using a total cost method to measure the percent complete with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the costs to be incurred under the contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations 
the company recognizes certain cargosearch system sales and other product revenue  primarily parcelsearch systems and spare parts  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  modified by emerging issues task force eitf no 
and sab no 
which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
in those instances where the company enters into agreements involving multiple revenue elements  the agreement is divided into separate elements of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to these elements based on fair value  and revenue recognition is considered separately for each individual element 
the company recognizes field service revenues as services are performed and generally recognizes revenues under maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the contract period 
revenues received in advance of services being rendered are deferred until such services have been provided 
the company s products are generally covered by a warranty for a one year period 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories consist of material  labor and manufacturing overhead and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
excessive manufacturing overhead costs attributable to idle facilities or abnormal production volumes are excluded from inventory and recorded as an expense in the period incurred 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand over the next twelve to eighteen months 
as demonstrated during and  demand for products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in inventory balances while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if inventory were determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
warrant liability in fiscal  the company issued  warrants in connection with a private placement offering of common stock 
these warrants can be exchanged for cash under certain circumstances including a merger  sale or tender offer of the company and as such the company recorded the fair value of these warrants as a long term liability on the balance sheet 
the fair value of these warrants is adjusted each period with the resulting gain or loss recorded as other income expense in the statement of operations 
the black scholes method is used to value the warrants and the calculation requires the use of estimates for stock price volatility and interest rates 
the black scholes value of these warrants can fluctuate significantly based on the current fair market value of the company s common stock  changes in interest rates or changes in the volatility of the company s stock price 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  the company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return 
the company records a valuation allowance against any net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies that either do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
throughout  the fasb released numerous proposed and final fsps regarding fin  which both clarified and modified fin s provisions 
on december   the fasb issued revised interpretation no 
fin r which will replace fin upon its effective date 
the application of fin to vies created after february   did not result in any entities requiring consolidation that would not already have required consolidation under the voting equity interest model 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an effect on the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking information and factors affecting future performance some of the statements contained in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference are forward looking statements  within the meaning of the federal securities laws  about our business and prospects 
our future results may differ materially from our past results and from those projected in the forward looking statements due to various uncertainties and risks including but not limited to those set forth below  on time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements contained herein after the date of this annual report 
the company s reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues could harm its business and prospects 
the company s business is heavily dependent on sales to a small number of customers  which include agencies of the united states government 
during fiscal  four customers accounted for of the company s total revenues 
during fiscal  four customers accounted for of the company s total revenues and during fiscal  five customers accounted for of the company s total revenues 
during fiscal and  the company s largest customer  an agency of the us government  accounted for approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
in general  the company s government contracts may be terminated at the government s discretion 
the termination of the company s relationship with one or more of its significant customers or the reduction or delay of orders of its systems by these customers would substantially reduce the company s revenues and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company conducts its business worldwide  which exposes it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
the company s international business  including sales to foreign governments  accounted for approximately  and of its net revenues for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   respectively 
although fiscal revenues reflect a domestic focus  the company anticipates that international sales will account for a significant percentage of its revenues in the future 
as a result of the company s worldwide business operations  it is subject to various risks  including international regulatory requirements and policy changes  lengthy sales cycles  longer payment cycles of foreign customers  difficulties in inventory management  accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  geopolitical instability  political and economic changes and disruptions  favoritism towards local suppliers  governmental currency controls  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and tariff regulations 
although the company s international sales have been denominated primarily in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the us dollar may make it more difficult for the company to compete with foreign manufacturers on price or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its sales and operating results 
the homeland security focus has increased financial expectations that may not materialize 
following the september  terrorist attacks  the united states government made it a national priority with the creation of the department of homeland security and other initiatives to increase security in airports  high threat federal facilities  us military bases  and seaports and borders 
the efforts of the united states government to revamp security in the united states have resulted in increased interest in the company s x ray inspection products 
however  the company has not at all times experienced an increased level of demand for its products to the extent such demand might have been anticipated 
this phenomenon occurred during and and may continue to occur again in the future 
the company is uncertain what solutions ultimately will be adopted and implemented by the united states government and other international entities to combat terrorism and whether the company s products will be a part of the solution 
even if the company s products are considered as part of the security solution  it is unclear what level the company will be involved and how quickly funding to purchase its products may be made available 
the company may incur non recoverable expenditures in anticipation of future demand for its products that may not materialize 
all of these factors may adversely impact the company s operations and create unpredictability in its revenues and operating results 
the company s lengthy sales cycle requires it to incur significant expenses with no assurance that it will generate revenue or recover such expenses 
a substantial portion of the company s sales depends upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand security at border crossing inspection sites  existing airports  seaports and other facilities 
accordingly  a portion of the company s product sales is subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  the company expends significant financial and managerial resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if the company fails to receive an order after expending these resources  it may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs incurred and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company s business is dependent upon governmental policies and appropriations 
the company s largest customers are government agencies and demand for its products is dependent upon national priorities and governmental initiatives 
these priorities and initiatives are subject to change from time to time in response to the economic and political environment 
the company is also exposed to the united states budget approval and appropriation cycle  which may be subject to significant and unpredictable delays 
if demand for the company s products is reduced because of a change in economic or political conditions or if there are delays in receiving governmental approvals and appropriations  sales of the company s products may be adversely affected and its business and prospects may be harmed 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for the company s products or increase its expenses 
the company competes in markets in which the company or its customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as health and safety regulations 
the company develops  configures and markets its products to meet its customers needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the company s products or increase its costs to comply with new regulations  both of which may adversely affect its operating results 
the company s reliance on only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products could harm its business and prospects 
the company relies on only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products 
the company s reliance on limited supply sources reduces its control over timely delivery  price increases  reliability  and quality of critical components 
obtaining alternative sources of supply of these key components could involve significant delays and other costs  and may not be available to the company on reasonable terms  if at all 
if the company changes any of its suppliers  the potential new supplier would be required to go through a qualification process  creating potential delays or reductions in product shipments 
the failure of any supplier to provide quality and timely components at an acceptable price  or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could result in lost or deferred sales  which would harm the company s business and prospects 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to fluctuate 
given the nature of the markets in which the company participates  it cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
a high proportion of the company s costs are fixed  due in part to its significant sales  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
as a result of its fixed costs  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the company s operating results and stock price in a quarter 
factors that may affect the company s quarterly operating results and the market price of its common stock include demand for and market acceptance of its x ray inspection systems  lengthy sales cycles and the effect of large orders  changes in political agendas or national priorities  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which the company does business  political unrest in the regions where the company transacts business  adverse changes in industries on which the company is particularly dependent  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices for its products  changes in the portions of its revenue represented by its various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the company s competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  variations in the company s product mix  the timing and amount of the company s expenditures in anticipation of future sales  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
the company could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims and adverse publicity if its x ray inspection systems fail to detect bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety 
if the company s x ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety  the company could be subject to product liability claims and negative publicity  which could result in increased costs  reduced sales  and a decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
there are many factors beyond the company s control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety 
examples of these factors include operator error or misuse of or malfunction of its equipment 
the failure of the company s systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury  loss of life  and extensive property damage and resulting claims against the company 
the company s insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
the company s product liability and umbrella liability insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
moreover  there is a risk that product liability insurance will not continue to be available to the company at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if liability claims exceed the company s current or available insurance coverage  its business and prospects may be harmed 
regardless of the adequacy of the company s product liability insurance protection  any significant claim may have an adverse affect on its industry and market reputation  leading to a substantial decrease in demand for its products and reduced revenues 
the company may not be able to fund its research and development activities 
the company generates funds for its research and development activities from operations  private sources and the government 
the company may be unable to generate the funds necessary to support its research and development activities if it does not generate sufficient funds from operations  other potential private sources  or the government 
the company may not successfully compete with other companies and research institutions for government funding and funding from other private sources 
additionally  government funding priorities are subject to frequent changes 
for example  in fiscal and  the company recorded  and  respectively  for government sponsored research and development 
there is no guarantee that the company will receive funds for government sponsored research in the future 
if the company is unable to fund its research and development activities through its operations or from outside sources  the company may be unable to continue to innovate or bring its innovations to market on a timely or cost effective basis  or its innovations may be surpassed by other competitors or new technologies 
the company s success depends on new product development 
the company s continuing research and development program is designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve its current products 
the company plans to expend significant resources on the development of its new products 
the successful development of its products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget over runs  technical problems  and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of new products and product enhancements  including  for example  changes requested or required by governmental and regulatory agencies 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction of x ray inspection systems  the company cannot assure that its product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
the company s failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget would harm its business and prospects 
the company s success depends upon its ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the market for the company s products has been characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements 
the company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its existing products  successfully develop new products that meet changing customer and regulatory requirements and gain market acceptance 
if the company fails to do so  its products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology  in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer 
in developing any new product  the company may be required to make a substantial investment before it can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if the company fails to accurately foresee its customers needs and future activities  it may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue 
the company may not be able to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed products that compete with the company s x ray inspection products 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than it does 
some of its competitors have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than the company does  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
the company s failure to compete successfully could decrease demand for its products or make its products obsolete 
in the inspection systems market  competition is based primarily on the following factors product performance  functionality and quality  price  the overall costs of the system  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  certification by government authorities  local market presence  and breadth of sales and service organization 
to remain competitive  the company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner 
the company anticipates that it may have to adjust the prices of some of its products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
the company s business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property 
the company relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyrights  trademarks  licensing arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect its technology 
despite its precautions  the steps the company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  patent  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
the company s patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
the laws of some foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect its products or intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states

the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its intellectual property rights  or to establish the validity of its property rights 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any such action
