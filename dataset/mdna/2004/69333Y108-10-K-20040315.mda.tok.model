this quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented

historically  pf chang s has experienced variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to preopening expenses 
we typically incur the most significant portion of preopening expenses associated with a given restaurant within the two months immediately preceding and the month of the opening of the restaurant 
additionally  there may be variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to partner investment expense as a result of the timing of opening new restaurants and the timing of purchasing partner interests 
partner investment expense represents the difference between the imputed fair value of our partners ownership interest and our partners cash capital contribution for that interest  as well as the excess  if any  of the purchase price at the time we repurchase a partner s interest over the imputed fair value of that interest 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new restaurant openings has had and is expected to continue to have a meaningful impact on preopening expenses  labor  operating and partner investment costs until such time as a larger base of restaurants in operation mitigates such impact

financing activities in fiscal years and consisted primarily of repayments on long term debt  distributions to our partners and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in december of  pf chang s entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a commercial lending institution 
the credit facility allows for borrowings up to million at an interest rate ranging from to basis points over the applicable london interbank offered rate libor 
at any time  but only one time  we have the right to increase the credit facility up to the maximum aggregate principal amount of million provided that we are in compliance with the terms of the facility 
the revolving credit facility expires on december  and contains certain restrictions and conditions which require us to maintain a certain minimum tangible net worth  an adjusted leverage ratio at a maximum of  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio no less than shares of our subsidiary  pei wei asian diner  inc serve as collateral for the credit facility 
pf chang s had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december   although million is committed for the issuance of a letter of credit which is required by insurance companies for our workers compensation and general liability insurance claims 
our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our current cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our projected capital requirements through in the event that additional capital is required  we will first access our existing credit facility 
in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we can not assure you that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
as of december   there were partners within the pf chang s china bistro  inc system 
during  we had the opportunity to purchase eleven partners interests  which had reached their five year threshold period during the year  as well as one additional partner s interest 
of these opportunities  we purchased two interests in their entirety  three partial interests and have passed on the remaining opportunities 
these purchases totaled approximately million 
of the total purchase price   was paid in cash while the majority of the remaining balance has been recorded as amounts due to related parties on the balance sheet at december  in  we will have the opportunity to purchase additional partnership interests 
if the entirety of these interests are purchased  the total purchase price will approximate million to million based upon the estimated fair value of the respective interests at december  
table of contents these amounts are subject to change based upon changes in the estimated fair value of the respective interests from december  through the date of purchase 
if all of these interests are purchased by the company in  the estimated financial impact would be an increase to earnings per share of based upon the elimination of the related minority interest charge in our income statement  partially offset by the anticipated intangible amortization expense relating to the purchase  both net of related income taxes 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
partnership structure pf chang s utilizes a partnership structure to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of its restaurants 
each partner who wishes to participate in the partnership structure is required to make a cash capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the partnership 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and seven percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees 
we perform an assessment of what the imputed fair value of these interests might be for a passive equity investor ie not someone actually working in the restaurant utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
this methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
any excess of the imputed fair value of these interests  determined by using the discounted cash flow model  over the cash contribution paid by our partners is recognized as expense over the initial five year term of the partnership agreement 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  pf chang s has the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority partner s interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair value 
the estimated fair value for such purchases and sales is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows of the subject restaurant s or region s financial results 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash or common stock of pf chang s over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments are required 
if and when we repurchase our partners interests  the excess  if any  of the purchase price over the imputed fair value of these interests has been recognized as expense in the month the repurchase occurs for all fiscal years prior to and including subsequent to the date of the modifications to our agreements as discussed in risk factors  which we anticipate to be in the first quarter of  the excess  if any  will be recorded in intangibles and amortized over years  after the modification has been in effect for six months 
there is also the possibility of additional charges relating to the modification if  within the initial five year period of the respective interest  the company repurchases said interest at a value larger than required by the agreements before modification 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of minority interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant  or partnership level for indicators of permanent impairment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

table of contents self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
in estimating our self insurance reserves  we utilize estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our own estimates based on pf chang s actual historical trends
