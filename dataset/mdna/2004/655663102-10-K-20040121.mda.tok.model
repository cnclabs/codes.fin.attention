the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to the company s results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
on a regular basis  the company reviews critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition most of the company s revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements  such as those including both installation and services  are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
revenues deferred in were not material 
a limited number of the company s large engineered systems sales contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
the amount of revenue recognized in any accounting period is based on the ratio of actual costs incurred through the end of the period to total estimated costs at completion 
cost estimates are updated on a quarterly basis 
during and  the company recognized approximately million and million  respectively  of revenue under the percentage of completion method 
the remaining revenues are recognized upon delivery 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
at november   goodwill represented approximately percent of the company s total assets 
the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of efd  inc in in  the company adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
in accordance with no 
 the company completed a transitional goodwill impairment test that resulted in no impairment loss being recognized 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if indications of impairment exist 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined by applying appropriate discount rates to estimated future cash flows and terminal value amounts for the reporting units 
the results of the company s analyses indicated that no reduction of goodwill is required 
in  goodwill amortization was   on an after tax basis  or 
per share 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined using the last in  first out method for percent of the company s consolidated inventories at november   with the first in  first out method used for the remaining inventory

the company has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
in the face of difficult economic conditions that accelerated the technical obsolescence of certain inventory and impacted the demand outlook for other inventory  the company recognized an inventory write down of million in the fourth quarter of million on an after tax basis  or 
per share 
the addition of million to the inventory obsolescence reserve brought the reserve balance to million

million  the balance in the inventory obsolescence reserve was million at november  
table of contents pension plans and other postretirement medical plan the measurement of liabilities related to the company s pension plans and postretirement medical plan is based on management s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
the weighted average discount rate based on aa quality fixed income investments used to determine the present value of the company s aggregate pension plan obligation was percent at november   compared to percent at november  the average expected rate of return long term investment rate on pension assets was decreased to percent in from percent in the assumed rate of compensation increases was reduced from percent in to percent in to reflect an inflationary outlook consistent with the discount and long term investment yield assumptions 
annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year 
differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses which are amortized into expense over a period of years 
with respect to the postretirement medical plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was percent at november   a decrease from at november  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care trend rate is assumed to be percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported 
for example  a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects point increase point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on postretirement obligation as of november  employees hired after january  are not eligible to participate in the postretirement medical plan
