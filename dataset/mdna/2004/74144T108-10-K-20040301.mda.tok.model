item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general 
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios 
investors outside the united states have grown over the last three years and now account for of our assets under management at december  we manage a broad range of us and international stock  bond  and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors 
investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management 
accordingly  fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 
total assets under our management were up more than billion during and ended the year at an all time record of billion  including billion in equity securities and billion in bond and money market holdings 
these investment assets include billion in the t 
rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and billion in other investment portfolios consisting of separately managed accounts  sub advised funds  and other sponsored investment portfolios offered to investors outside the united states and through variable annuity life insurance plans 
improving financial market valuations and income added more than billion to our assets under management during while net investor inflows added more than billion 
the previous period end record for assets under management was billion at march   the month that equity market valuations peaked and the three year market downturn began 
in  financial markets generally bottomed out in the first quarter and then began an upward movement that continued through the rest of the year before accelerating in the fourth quarter 
a us market environment with income tax cuts and low interest rates provided the underlying foundation for the market recovery 
after three down years  the dow jones industrials ended up and the nasdaq composite  led primarily by larger cap technology companies  was up 
the broader market also captured significant gains  as the s p returned nearly 
while the early indications are that improving corporate profits and low interest rates will be the basis for continued market gains in  we do expect that the financial market growth rate in the coming year will be lower than that of page this positive financial market backdrop was diminished over the last four months of by news of trading abuses at several investment management firms  including revelations that certain fund companies permitted excessive trading or illegal after hours trading 
in addition  certain intermediaries that process fund transactions allegedly assisted some investors in executing improper mutual fund trades 
we have conducted a thorough review of our policies  procedures  and practices with respect to inappropriate trading activities and we have found them to be sound 
as a result of the disclosures at other investment management firms  the industry and mutual funds in particular have come under greater regulatory scrutiny 
new legislation and regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry are expected in the coming months 
net cash inflows during were also a strong driver of increased assets under management 
defined contribution retirement plans  which generally provide individual investors a regular opportunity to have recurring cash investments made directly from each paycheck into personal retirement accounts  were the source of steady cash inflows through the market downturn 
as progressed  the individual investor began returning to the financial markets after an almost three year absence and our cash inflows increased 
we reach individual investors directly and through third party distribution efforts 
institutional investors both in the united states and in foreign countries also added net cash inflows during the year 
in total  investors added nearly billion to the t 
rowe price mutual funds in the us and billion to the other portfolios that we manage 
reflecting the very significant improvement in the financial markets  the fourth quarter of produced the largest net inflows  accounting for billion or nearly of the net inflows for the year 
for the year  the mutual fund inflows were third only to our peak inflows of billion and billion experienced in and  respectively 
in this improving market environment  we expect to increase our expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients 
these efforts may involve significant costs that would precede the recognition of any future revenues that we might realize from increases to our assets under management 
results of operations 
versus total revenues increased million to million and net revenues increased million to million 
net income increased million  or  to million 
diluted earnings per share increased from to 
investment advisory revenues earned from the t 
rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased million on higher average assets under management which increased billion from billion in to billion in market appreciation and income  net of dividends paid and not reinvested  added billion to mutual fund assets during and net investor inflows added another billion 
as a result  fund assets under management increased from billion at the beginning of to billion at december  stock funds had net investor subscriptions of billion while bond and money market page funds added net inflows of billion 
investors in the mid cap growth  equity income  and growth stock funds accounted for billion of the net inflows during the year 
bond fund investors seeking higher yields added 
billion to the high yield fund 
investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased million to million in average assets for the year were billion  billion higher than in year end assets in these portfolios increased billion to billion at december  net inflows to these portfolios were billion in third party distribution efforts and additions from new institutional investors  both in the us and overseas  were responsible for the new investment dollars 
fees from our managed disposition service for equity securities distributed from venture capital investment pools accounted for million of the advisory revenue increase 
though recurring  these fees will vary significantly over time and through different phases of the market cycle 
administrative revenues and other income increased million to million in this increase is primarily attributable to increased b distribution fees received based on greater assets under management in the advisor class shares of our sponsored mutual funds and to the transfer agency and participant recordkeeping services that we provide for defined contribution retirement plans 
these revenue changes are generally offset by similar changes in the expenses that we incur to distribute the advisor shares through third parties and provide the services to the retirement plans 
our discount brokerage operation added million of the increased revenues from commissions earned on greater trading volume 
operating expenses in were million higher than in our largest expense  compensation and related costs  including bonuses  increased to million 
at december   we employed  associates  up over the year 
advertising and promotion expenditures were flat versus the year as we lowered spending during the first nine months of due to financial market conditions 
the final quarter of saw an increase in our advertising and promotional spending to million  or of s total expense 
we vary our promotional spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as the extent of our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 
we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first quarter of to be similar to the fourth quarter of  with succeeding quarters being higher than that of the comparable periods 
market conditions will dictate the exact level of our spending 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million 
new capital additions in were less than depreciation expense and the depreciable book value of our property and equipment is lower than in the prior year 
other operating expenses increased million due primarily to the million increase in distribution costs to third parties which offset the corresponding revenues recognized from the b fees discussed above 
overall  net operating income for increased nearly million  or  from our net non operating results  which include the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest and credit facility expenses  improved from a loss of million in to a gain of 
million in during  we recognized net investment losses of million on our page mutual fund investments  private equity investments  and our investments in sponsored collateralized bond obligations 
interest and related costs were down 
million from as we repaid all of our outstanding debt obligations during the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is slightly higher than that of due primarily to credits in the year arising from lower than previously estimated state income tax liabilities 
versus net income decreased about million  or  to million 
diluted earnings per share was unchanged at as lower weighted average shares and share equivalents outstanding  due to our repurchase of million common shares in and our common stock s generally lower per share market value  offset the decline in net income 
with the adoption of the new accounting standard for goodwill on january   we ceased amortizing the goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
after excluding the amortization of goodwill in the amount of million  adjusted net income for was million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 
total revenues declined million  or  to million and net revenues declined a similar or million to million 
investment advisory revenues earned from the t 
rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states decreased million as average fund assets under management were billion during  billion less than in weakness in financial market valuations that began in early continued for three years 
during the second half of  us equity market valuations fell to levels last seen in the first half of mutual fund assets ended at almost billion  down billion from december  and nearly billion from the average 
the price funds had billion of net cash inflows during  the highest net annual inflows since  however  market depreciation  net of income and dividends paid but not reinvested  more than offset the inflows and reduced fund assets billion in money market and bond funds had net investor subscriptions of billion and stock funds added an additional billion of net inflows 
bond fund investors seeking higher yields added million to the high yield fund in net inflows of billion to us domestic stock funds in were led primarily by value oriented investors in the equity income  mid cap value  and small cap value funds while international stock fund investors had net redemptions of billion during the year 
investment advisory revenues earned from the other investment portfolios that we manage were down million in on lower assets under management that also resulted from lower market valuations 
the value of the assets in these portfolios decreased billion during to billion at year end as net cash inflows of billion were more than offset by billion of market value losses 
additionally  advisory fees from our managed disposition service were down million from to million in these fees declined during and as market conditions were unfavorable and investment portfolios changed 
administrative revenues and other income decreased million from to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to transfer agency and participant recordkeeping services that we provide for defined contribution retirement plans and was partially offset by a million increase in b distribution fees received from our advisor class of mutual fund shares 
page total revenues also increased million on greater investment income from the larger investment portfolio of our savings bank subsidiary 
our savings bank depositor base increased from million at december  to million at the end of interest expense on the higher deposits increased million 
we manage the assets of our savings bank as a portfolio in a manner similar to that of our other investment advisory clients 
the net of our investment portfolio income and depositor interest expense results in a net revenue amount that is similar to the investment advisory fees earned on the investment portfolios that we manage 
operating expenses in were million less than in the elimination of the amortization of goodwill accounts for million or about of the decrease 
our largest expense  compensation and related costs  decreased or million from our average staff size  use of temporary personnel in the technology operations group  and total levels of compensation were all lower in attrition and a late staff reduction lowered our average number of associates in by from the average level 
at december   we employed  associates  up from the average 
advertising and promotion expenditures were down million in as we again curtailed these expenditures due to weak financial market conditions that made investors more cautious and less active 
occupancy and facility costs and other operating expenses in decreased million and million  respectively  versus these reductions primarily reflect the first half completions of several technology initiatives as well as the international facilities and infrastructure transition that resulted from the august purchase of robert fleming holdings interest in our consolidated subsidiary  t 
rowe price international 
through the first half of  we incurred substantial costs to establish and transition this entity to new operating facilities with appropriate infrastructure support for their international investment operations 
robert fleming affiliates previously provided the space and infrastructure support for these offices 
overall  net operating income was up million from to including the goodwill amortization of million in that did not recur in non operating income and expenses include the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest expense incurred on our indebtedness 
while we recognized million of net investment income in  we experienced a net investment loss of million in as interest and dividend income of million was more than offset by losses across all of our investment portfolios 
during  we recognized million of losses on dispositions and other than temporary impairments of our mutual fund holdings  million of losses on our holdings of collateralized bond obligations  million of losses from exchange rate fluctuations on our yen debt  and million of valuation decreases in our private equity holdings 
our mutual fund investment holdings at december  include an aggregate net gain  before income taxes  of million that is included in stockholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this net gain has not been recognized in our statements of income and comprises aggregate gains of million and aggregate losses of million that have arisen since june  and are considered temporary 
interest expense on our debt is down more than million due to lower page principal balances and interest rates in overall  we recognized a net non operating loss of million in versus net non operating income of million in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is lower than that of due primarily to eliminating the amortization of nondeductible goodwill in capital resources and liquidity 
during  stockholders equity increased from billion to more than billion 
available net liquid assets  including our mutual fund investments in which there are no unrealized losses  total more than million at the beginning of unused committed credit facilities that are available to the company include million expiring in june and million expiring in june during  we retired our remaining million of outstanding debt 
operating activities provided cash flows of million in  up million from  including million of increased net income offset by lower depreciation expense of million 
cash from our operating activities were used to fund million of net investing activities and million of net financing activities in net cash expended in investing activities decreased million versus primarily due to the investment of the more than million of greater net depositor inflows made at our savings bank subsidiary in net cash used in financing activities decreased more than million versus we repurchased fewer common shares in and funded them entirely from the proceeds of stock option exercises 
in  we expended a net of more than million on greater share repurchase activity while also receiving the larger million net inflow of new savings bank deposits 
we again increased dividends paid to our stockholders in and raised our quarterly rate to 
per share in december 
comparatively for  operating activities provided cash flows of million on lower net income that included a million non cash charge for amortization of goodwill 
operating activities that year funded nearly all of the net investing activities of million and net financing activities of million 
mutual fund proceeds in of million were used to fund million of investments and million of capital expenditures 
we repaid million of our bank borrowings and used million to repurchase our common shares in financing activities 
increased savings bank deposits during the year were used to fund the net investments made by our savings bank subsidiary 
the following table presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees 
because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature  we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations 
the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in and future years 
page total later noncancelable operating leases other purchase commitments we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional investments totaling million at december  property and equipment expenditures in  including those for business continuity facilities and support  are anticipated to be about million and are expected to be funded from operating cash flows 
critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives 
further  significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet  the revenues and expenses in our statement of income  and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the financial statements 
making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time 
accordingly  actual amounts or future results could differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our financial statements and notes thereto 
we have historically presented those significant accounting policies that we use in the preparation of our financial statements as an integral part of those statements and have done so again in this annual report 
in the following discussion  we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies often requires significant judgments and estimates 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities 
we classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held in the investment portfolio of our savings bank subsidiary as available for sale 
at the end of each quarter  we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss to determine if that loss is other than temporary 
a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary loss and an impairment is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence  such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end  to overcome that presumption 
we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near term recovery is possible 
a debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered impaired and an other than temporary loss is recognized whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the issuer s financial condition and our intent to hold that security 
goodwill 
as a result of the adoption of a new financial accounting page standard on january   we ceased recording recurring charges to amortize the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet 
the standard instead requires that we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis using a fair value approach 
we make that evaluation in the third quarter of each year 
goodwill is considered impaired whenever the carrying amount of the related reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that unit 
we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit  our investment advisory business 
because our testing in and demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeded our carrying amount basically  our stockholders equity  we concluded that no impairment exists 
should we reach a different conclusion when we conduct our evaluation in subsequent years  additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non cash charge needed to recognize the impairment 
we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred 
the maximum possible future impairment charge that we could incur is the total goodwill recognized in our balance sheet  million 
provision for income taxes 
after compensation and related costs  our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our second largest annual expense 
we operate in several states and several other countries through our various subsidiaries  and must allocate our income  expenses  and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions 
accordingly  our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations 
annually  we file tax returns which represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities 
each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations 
from time to time  we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to  or in the process of  being audited by various tax authorities 
because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates  it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements 
in such cases  it is possible that additional expense for prior reporting periods may be recorded in subsequent periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 
stock options 
the summary of significant accounting policies includes certain pro forma disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants 
fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter term  market traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations  including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date  the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period  and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time 
additionally  the recognition of expense fluctuates based on the forfeiture rate for unvested options when employees leave our company 
our estimates for the variables used in the valuation model are made for the purpose of theoretically determining an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted 
unlike almost all other page expenses  the resulting theoretical charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non cash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 
forward looking information 
from time to time  information or statements provided by or on behalf of t 
rowe price  including those within this annual report  may contain certain forward looking information  including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income  changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management  our expense levels  and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions 
readers are cautioned that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of t 
rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors  including but not limited to those discussed below 
further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our future revenues and results will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management 
such changes result from many factors including  among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t 
rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios  fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management  our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios  and changes in retirement savings trends favoring participant directed investments and defined contribution plans 
the ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence  the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indices  the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management  and broader financial services sectors  and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business 
our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds determined to terminate or significantly alter the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements 
our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses  which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states  variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  any goodwill impairment that may arise  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations  expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  depreciation  amortization  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure  unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our page clients  and disruptions of services  including those provided by third parties  such as facilities  communications  power  and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 
our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation  and changes in legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results  including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general  or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management 
accordingly  declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income 
we invest in our sponsored mutual funds  which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading  we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments 
mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk  that is  the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares 
each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices  credit ratings  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares 
this potential future loss of value  before any income tax benefits  reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund s lowest fair value per share during the past year 
in considering this presentation  it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day  it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persist  and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 
fair value at potential december  of lower of portfolio value portfolio potential loss stock funds bond funds the comparable potential loss of value shown in last year s annual report was million on sponsored mutual fund investments of million at the end of during  we actually experienced net unrealized gains of million as positive market conditions significantly improved the value of our fund investments 
investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds  by their nature  are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments 
t 
rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many page domestic and international funds 
in addition  investment holdings may be altered from time to time  in response to changes in market risks and other factors  as deemed appropriate by management 
the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk 
if interest rates change  the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 
we also make other investments that we include in our balance sheet in other assets 
we are at risk for losses on these investments should market conditions deteriorate 
at december   we hold a million investment in a sponsored high yield collateralized bond obligation and investments totaling million in private equity and other entities 
our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the million recognized in our balance sheet 
additionally  we have recognized our interest in daiwa sb investments japan at million using the cost basis of accounting 
our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen because the functional currency of daiwa sb investments is the yen 
the us dollar weakened versus the currencies of several foreign countries in which we operate  most prominent among which is great britain 
we incur operating expenses and have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations  though our revenue stream is predominately realized in us dollar receipts 
we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially impact our results of operations
