executive overview we are a global provider of software that helps our customers achieve their goals of securely managing their wide range of identities across different platforms  architectures and devices 
our customer value is achieved when we serve as a trusted advisor to our customer and our products are successfully deployed 
entrust s goal is to be more than a software vendor to our customers by assuming the important role of partner and trusted advisor for their identity and access management needs 
the identity and access management market  commonly called the i am market  is the overall segment of the information technology market place that we participate in 
this recently named space includes what was formerly the a market authentication  authorization and administration  as well as identity management  
table of contents provisioning  access management and directories 
all of these areas play a pivotal role in the management of digital identities and information 
entrust differentiates itself in this market as a leader in providing the necessary products and services for securing digital identities and information across a wide range of architectures and devices 
our products and services provide customers with i am solutions  which meet their specific needs for secure messaging  secure identity management and secure data 
our broad set of capabilities in these three areas gives entrust a strong portfolio in the i am market 
customer s benefit from their ability to purchase one set of capabilities from entrust to meet their i am needs and have  at the same time  the option to extend their investment in our products and services across the requirements of their business 
we believe this is a competitive advantage for us 
our approach of blending best in class products and services  whether developed by entrust or one of its partners  to deliver a comprehensive suite to the market space also goes along well with the trusted advisor role that we have taken with our customers 
we have the capabilities to assist our customers across their wide range of needs for i am  where many of our competitors can only assist them with respect to a narrow range of needs 
we look to continue to grow our market share in the i am space 
we sell our products and services in both the enterprise and government market space 
in  of our software sales were in our extended government vertical market  which includes healthcare 
this was down from in a combination of increased enterprise sales in and lower government spending drove the year over year change 
we are well positioned in both markets  and we see growth opportunities in each area 
in the extended government vertical market  we have a strong penetration in the us federal government market space  the government of canada  singapore  denmark  united kingdom and across continental europe 
as governments continue to increase spending on e government initiatives and security projects  we are well positioned to help them in their i am needs 
in the enterprise market  the need for a deeper integration with partners  suppliers and customers  coupled with the need for security and lower costs  continues to be key drivers for our customers to purchase our offerings 
budgets  timing  and allocation of budget dollars continue to keep us guarded on our growth expectations in the coming year  however  we feel the spending environment is better than it has been in the last two years 
we rely significantly on large deals in each quarter 
our software revenue from our top five customers in a given quarter is on average approximately 
in the past we have had quarters where this was a much lower percentage  which has sometimes dramatically reduced both our total revenue and our earnings and earnings per share 
also impacting software revenue has been the process that our customers are going through to complete a proof of concept  which sometimes has proven to produce a longer sales cycle 
we are also impacted by our customers recent buying behavior  which is to buy only for immediate need as opposed to making a larger purchase in order to get a better discount 
all of these factors can come into play in impacting our revenue on a quarterly basis 
in order to support our market opportunities  we have a marketing organization focused on creating brand awareness and new business opportunities for the company 
key branding initiatives include web advertising  search engine optimization for key word searches  public relations initiatives and sponsorships of key security and government events and forums 
one of these key initiatives that has carried over from to is our focus on positioning ourselves as a thought leader in information security governance isg 
in we co chaired a task force for the business software alliance to focus on this issue 
the task force launched an in depth framework for enterprise isg 
also in  we were selected to co chair the department of homeland securities task force on cybersecurity 
this task force is also looking at the isg issue  but from a homeland security standpoint 
we are hopeful that our work on isg will position us to be a key component of the quality process that companies adopt to secure their most critical digital resources 
assisting us in our growth strategy in this market will be our ability to serve as the trusted advisor to our clients 
in this capacity we will continue to expand our offerings by building new products and solutions  partnering with technology providers and bringing it all together for the customer with our services offerings

we have invested heavily in this area and  with our support and maintenance revenues at a record level in q   we feel the investment is paying off 
we remain positive on our outlook for services in however  budgets  adoption of our software and our leveraging of our services partners are all factors that could impact our ability to create services revenue

business overview during  we continued our strategy of focusing on core vertical and geographic markets 
we also announced a restructuring plan in may that resulted in us recording million of charges in the second and third quarters of in connection with this restructuring plan

table of contents in addition  impairments were recorded for a strategic investment made three years ago in brazil of million and for purchased product rights of million 
the purchased product rights impairment was the result of a re assessment of the cash flows from the related developed technology as a result of the restructuring plan 
software license revenues decreased from driven by our lower software transactions closure rate and lower average purchase value in services and maintenance revenues declined in  due to lower professional services revenues  and despite the fact that deployment initiatives through our professional services organization increased and we experienced record customer support revenues

in  our most complex accounting judgments were made in the areas of software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  restructuring charges and related adjustments  impairment of long term strategic and equity investments and purchased product rights  the provision for income taxes  stock based compensation and accrued compensation expenses 
the restructuring and related charges are not anticipated to be recurring in nature 
however  the financial reporting of restructuring and related charges will continue to require judgments until such time as the corresponding accruals are fully paid out and or no longer required 
software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term strategic investments  provision for income taxes  stock based compensation and accrued compensation expenses are expected to continue to be ongoing elements of our critical accounting processes and judgments 
software revenue recognition with respect to software revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and related accounting guidance and pronouncements 
due to the complexity of some software license agreements  we routinely apply judgments to the application of software revenue recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
we analyze various factors  including a review of the specifics of each transaction  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenues and cost recognized 
different judgments and or different contract structures could lead to different accounting conclusions  which could have a material effect on our reported earnings 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized when we have received an executed license agreement or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  the software has been shipped if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is probable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
this policy is applicable to all sales transactions  including sales to resellers and end user customers 
license revenues are generated both through direct sales to end users as well as through various partners  including system integrators  value added resellers and distributors 
license revenue is recognized when the sale has occurred for an identified end user  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we are notified of a sale by a reseller to the end user customer in the same period that the actual sale took place 
we do not offer a right of return on sales of our software products 
for all sales  we use a binding contract  purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
sales to our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we consider delivery to occur when we ship the product  so long as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the documented agreement 
if we determine the fee is not fixed or determinable at the onset  we recognize revenue when the fee becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess if collection is probable based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we do not record revenue until such time as collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 

table of contents we do not generally include acceptance provisions in arrangements with customers 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the company is sometimes subject to fiscal funding clauses in its software licensing transactions with the united states government and its agencies 
such clauses generally provide that the license is cancellable if the legislature or funding authority does not appropriate the funds necessary for the governmental unit to fulfill its obligations under the licensing arrangement 
in these circumstances  software licensing arrangements with governmental organizations containing a fiscal funding clause are evaluated to determine whether the uncertainty of a possible license arrangement cancellation is a remote contingency 
if the likelihood of cancellation is assessed as remote  then the software licensing arrangement is considered non cancellable and the related software licensing revenue is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method  based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the various elements 
these elements may include one or more of the following software licenses  maintenance and support  consulting services and training 
we first allocate the arrangement fee  in a multiple element transaction  to the undelivered elements based on the total fair value of those undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence 
this portion of the arrangement fee is deferred 
then the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we attribute the discount offered in a multiple element arrangement entirely to the delivered elements of the transaction  which are typically software licenses 
fair values for the future maintenance and support services are based upon separate sales of renewals of maintenance and support contracts 
fair value of future services  training or consulting services is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
in some instances  a group of contracts or agreements with the same customer may be so closely related that they are  in effect  part of a single multiple element arrangement  and therefore  we would undertake to allocate the corresponding revenues amongst the various components  as described above 
our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services 
when the customization is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the software license and consulting services revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which requires revenue to be recognized based upon the percentage of work effort completed on the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain doubtful accounts allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the revenue transaction is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we also assess whether collection is reasonably assured 
if any portion of a fee is due after days from the invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including previous transactions with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 

table of contents we base our ongoing estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts primarily on the aging of the balances in the accounts receivable  our historical collection patterns and changes in the creditworthiness of our customers 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on the best information available to us and is re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we exhaust all avenues and methods of collection  including the use of third party collection agencies  before writing off a customer balance as uncollectible 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
each circumstance in which we conclude that a provision for non payment by a customer may be required must be carefully considered in order to determine the true factors leading to that potential non payment to ensure that it is proper for it to be categorized as an allowance for bad debts 
our accounts receivable include material balances from a limited number of customers  with five customers accounting for of gross accounts receivable at december   compared to of gross accounts receivable at december  for more information on our customer concentration  see our related discussion in certain factors that may affect our business 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying this assessment or changes in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  and the timing of information related to the change in financial condition could result in a different assessment of the existing credit risk of our accounts receivable and thus  a different required allowance  which could have a material impact on our reported earnings 
as of december   accounts receivable totaled million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
restructuring charges and adjustments june restructuring plan on june   we announced that our board of directors had approved a restructuring plan to refocus on the most significant market opportunities and to reduce operating costs due to the macroeconomic factors that were negatively affecting technology investment in the market 
the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
as a result of the restructuring plan and the impact of macroeconomic conditions on us and our global base of customers  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the second quarter of  with a subsequent reduction of million in the first half of in the second quarter of  we made a further adjustment to increase the restructuring charges that we had previously recorded related to the june restructuring plan by million to reflect a change in our projected sublet lease recoveries for our santa clara  california facility 
we concluded that this was required as a result of our realization that the market for leased facilities in that region will not recover in the timeframe that we had estimated  as evidenced by significantly lower projected sublease rates for our facility as supplied to us by our external real estate advisors 
we also recorded a million reduction to our june restructuring accrual in the third quarter of  as a result of the july settlement of an existing contractual obligation under a marketing and distribution agreement  at a value significantly less than the full accrued obligation 
we conducted our assessment of the accounting effects of the june restructuring plan in accordance with eitf no

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  apb opinion no

 restructuring and impairment charges 
our assessment required assumptions in estimating the original accrued restructuring charges of million at june   including estimating future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  liabilities from employee severances  and costs to exit business activities 
changes in these assessments with 
table of contents respect to the accrued restructuring charges for the june restructuring program  particularly the estimation of sub lease income for restructured facilities  of million at december   could have a material effect on our reported results  as actual results could vary from these assumptions and estimates 
as at december   we estimated a total of million of sublease recoveries in our restructuring accrual 
of this amount  million is related to the santa clara facility 
in addition  million of the million is recoverable under existing sublease agreements  and the remaining million of rent recoveries is based on estimates which may be subject to adjustment based upon changes in the real estate sublet markets 
the restructuring plan announced on june  was completed by june no further charges are anticipated 
however  actual results could vary from the currently recorded estimates 
may restructuring plan on may   we announced a restructuring plan aimed at lowering costs and better aligning our resources to customer needs 
the plan allows us to have tighter integration between the groups in our organization that interact with customers  which better positions us to take advantage of the market opportunities for our new products 
the restructuring plan included the elimination of employee positions to lower operating costs  closing of under utilized office space  and re assessing the value of related excess long lived assets 
the workforce portion of the restructuring plan included severance and related costs of million for positions from all functional areas of the company and had been completed by december  the consolidation of under utilized facilities included costs relating to lease obligations through the first quarter of primarily from excess space in the company s santa clara  california and addison  texas facilities and accelerated amortization on related leaseholds and equipment 
the facilities plan was executed by september  and  as a result  the company recorded million of charges during related to these facilities  including million for accelerated amortization on leaseholds and equipment whose estimated useful lives had been impacted by the plan to cease using the related excess space in the company s facilities 
the total amount of the workforce and facilities charges was million 
of this amount  million had been incurred by june  and charged to the restructuring charges line in the consolidated statement of operations for the second quarter of  while the remaining million was recorded in the third quarter of we conducted our assessment of the accounting effects of the may restructuring plan in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  and the relevant provisions of the sec s sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
our assessment required assumptions in estimating the restructuring charges of million  including estimating liabilities related to employee severance  future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  and other costs to exit activities 
changes in these assessments with respect to the accrued restructuring charges for the may restructuring plan of million at december   could have a material effect on our reported results 
in addition  actual results could vary from these assumptions and estimates  in particular with regard to the sublet of excess facilities  resulting in an adjustment that could have a material effect on our future financial results 
our accrual related to the may restructuring at december   includes a total of million of estimated sublease recoveries  which may be subject to adjustment based upon changes in the real estate sublet markets 
the restructuring plan announced on may  was completed by december  no further changes are anticipated 
however  actual results could vary from the currently recorded estimates 
impairment of long term strategic and equity investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of strategic investments on an on going basis  but at least annually 
factors that we consider important in determining whether an assessment is warranted and could 
table of contents trigger impairment include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that the company in which we invested would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the company s operating performance or business model and changes in overall market conditions 
these investments are in private companies of which we typically own less than of the outstanding stock 
we account for these investments under the cost method 
because there is not a liquid market for these securities  we often must make estimates of the value of our investments 
we recorded charges related to other than temporary declines in the value of certain strategic investments of million in we also recorded a gain on the disposition of a long term strategic investment of million in during  we recorded additional impairments of million 
these impairments were related to our investments in several different companies  which were fully impaired due to insolvency after having been partially impaired in one investment was impaired due to an other than temporary decline in value which was triggered by a significant impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the company 
in the second quarter of  due to a decline in market conditions and a restructuring of the investee by its management  we concluded that our investment in modulo security solutions had suffered an other than temporary decline in fair value as determined by third party market transactions  and as such  we recorded an impairment in the second quarter of in the amount of million 
to date  we have recorded a total of million of impairments with respect to our long term strategic investments 
we have no other strategic investments recorded as of december  in april  we began accounting for our investment in entrust japan under the equity method in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock and arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  on the step by step acquisition method  during the second quarter of  we recorded a retroactive adjustment to consolidated accumulated deficit to record our share of the post acquisition losses of entrust japan for prior years in the amount of thousand  as required by this accounting guidance 
this retroactive adjustment is attributable to our pro rata share of losses recorded by entrust japan during the period in which we owned less than of its voting stock  to the extent of our previous investment and affected the results of periods prior to those shown here 
in addition  we recorded our share of post acquisition losses of entrust japan  in the amount of thousand in our consolidated losses for and thousand for these losses are attributable to our pro rata share of entrust japan s losses while we have had an equity ownership of approximately of its voting stock 
during  entrust japan exceeded the performance targets established at the date of our increased investment 
however  during  the actual growth of entrust japan was less than the original projections 
it is possible that future growth will also fall short of projections  and due to entrust japan s history of operating losses  it is possible that all or substantially all of the remaining million equity investment in entrust japan at december  may be expensed through our operating results in future quarters as a result of our recognition of our equity share of losses in entrust japan 
as of december   we believe that there has not been an impairment of our investment in entrust japan 
impairment of purchased product rights purchased product rights are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in such reviews  the related undiscounted cash flows expected are compared with their carrying values to determine if a write down to fair value is required 
as a result of actions undertaken pursuant to the restructuring plan in the second quarter of  coupled with the commercial release of a next generation software product  we reviewed the estimated future cash flows from the developed technology acquired from encommerce 
based on these events  the net present value of the 
table of contents estimated future cash flows from the purchased product rights was negative 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded an impairment charge in the second quarter of relating to this asset in the amount of the remaining carrying value of million  as we determined the asset had minimal fair value 
provision for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states 
in addition  we have based the calculation of our income taxes in each jurisdiction upon inter company agreements  which could be challenged by tax authorities in these jurisdictions 
the income tax accounting process involves our estimating our actual current exposure in each jurisdiction together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   which offsets deferred income tax assets relating to united states and foreign net operating loss nol and tax credit carry forwards in the amount of million and million of deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences 
this valuation allowance represents the full value of our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets as a result of our recent history of financial losses 
therefore  our balance sheet includes no net deferred tax benefits related to these nol s and tax credit carry forwards 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to contribute to our success by attracting  retaining and motivating talented employees and to align employee interests with the interests of our existing stockholders 
stock options are typically granted to employees when they first join us but can also be granted when there is a significant change in an employee s responsibilities and  occasionally  to achieve equity within a peer group 
the compensation committee of the board of directors may  however  grant additional options to executive officers and key employees for other reasons 
under the stock option plans  the participants may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock and substantially all of our employees and directors participate in at least one of our plans 
options issued under these plans generally are granted at fair market value at the date of grant  become exercisable at varying rates  generally over three or four years and generally expire ten years from the date of grant 
we recognize that stock options dilute existing shareholders and have attempted to control the number of options granted while remaining competitive with our compensation packages 
at december   a large percentage approximately of our outstanding employee stock options carried exercise prices in excess of the closing market price of our common stock on that day 
the compensation committee of the board of directors overseas the granting of all stock based incentive awards 
we account for our stock option plans under the recognition and intrinsic value measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related accounting guidance 
accordingly  no stock based compensation expense is reflected in net earnings for grants to employees under these plans  when the exercise price for options granted under these plans is equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
all of the options granted to employees in the periods after had exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant and therefore  no stock based compensation costs are reflected in earnings for these options in these periods 
compensation expense was recognized for our stock based compensation plans in because the exercise price of some options granted in 
table of contents that period were determined  for accounting purposes  to be below the fair value of the underlying stock as of the grant date for such stock options 
if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based compensation  the effect would have been to increase our net loss in  and to million  million and million  respectively  and consequently  increase our net loss per share to  and for  and  respectively 
however  entrust believes  that due to the volatility of our stock and the inherent limitations of option valuation models  the expenses that would be recorded under sfas no 
are not as meaningful as a careful consideration of the outstanding option data  which is disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements  included in this report 
accrued compensation expenses during the third quarter of  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an incentive compensation plan 
under the terms of the plan  essentially all of our non sales employees will qualify for incentive compensation if certain business performance targets are attained by the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of such targets were met in the fourth quarter of we accrued approximately million under terms of the plan during if the business objectives are not achieved under the plan in the first quarter of  it is possible that the amounts accrued will be reversed in future periods

we also generate revenues from consulting  training and post contract support  or maintenance  performed for customers who license our products 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the sop no 
 software revenue recognition  sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and related accounting guidance and pronouncements 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized as revenue upon receipt of an executed license agreement  or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  and shipment of the software  
table of contents if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is probable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
this policy is applicable to all sales transactions  including sales to resellers and end user customers 
we do not offer a right of return on sales of our software products 
for arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method  based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the various elements 
these elements may include one or more of the following software licenses  maintenance and support  consulting services and training 
we first allocate the arrangement fee  in a multiple element transaction  to the undelivered elements based on the total fair value of those undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence 
this portion of the arrangement fee is deferred 
then the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we attribute the discount offered in a multiple element arrangement entirely to the delivered elements of the transaction  which are typically software licenses 
fair values for the future maintenance and support services are based upon separate sales of renewals of maintenance and support contracts 
fair value of future services  training or consulting services is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
in some instances  a group of contracts or agreements with the same customer may be so closely related that they are  in effect  part of a single multiple element arrangement  and therefore  we would allocate the corresponding revenues among the various components  as described above 
revenues from maintenance services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
if maintenance services are included free of charge or discounted in a license agreement  such amounts are unbundled from the license fee at their fair market value based upon the value established by independent sales of such maintenance services to other customers 
revenues from the sale of web server certificates are also recognized ratably over the term of the certificate  which is typically one to two years 
consulting and training revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
consulting services are typically performed under separate service agreements and are usually performed on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation and deployment of our products and do not include significant customization or development of the underlying software code 
we use the percentage of completion method to account for fixed price custom development contracts 
under this method  we recognize revenue and profit as the work on the contract progresses 
revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of the total cost incurred to date divided by the total estimated contract cost to the total contract value  and any projected loss is recognized immediately 
the project cost estimates are reviewed on a regular basis 
total revenues 
total revenues in were million  which represented a decrease of from the million of total revenues in  which in turn  represented a decrease from the million of total revenues in total revenues derived from north america of million in represented a decrease of from the million in  which in turn  represented a decrease from the million in total revenues derived from outside of north america of million in represented a decrease of from the million in  which in turn  represented a decrease from the million in the overall decline in total revenues from to was driven by a reduced closure rate for software deals  particularly in the united states 
in  the effect was felt most strongly in north america  due to the continued soft economic climate  which resulted in a decrease in extended government revenues in the united states from million in  to million in  or a decrease 
the decline was also felt in canada  where included million of revenues from software deliveries 
table of contents accounted for on a subscription basis relating to the government of canada secure channel project  the revenues from which were not fully replaced in the majority of the overall decline in total revenues in from was experienced in canada  europe  asia and other international locales  which was mainly due to the continued softening of the economic climate internationally and to our restructuring plan from the second quarter of  which resulted in fewer sales resources being applied in all regions  particularly in asia pacific and latin america 
in addition  we generated million of revenues from the government of canada secure channel project in  from software deliveries  accounted for on a subscription basis  and the first phase of the professional services work related to this project  compared to the million in the level of non north american revenues has fluctuated from period to period  and this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the decline in the level of north american revenues  in  and  reflected the prolonged economic downturn experienced in this region and throughout the industry  with customers buying for their immediate needs  as opposed to buying total project or enterprise wide  in the tough economic market 
however  the lower percentage year over year decrease in revenues derived from north america  from to  when compared to the same percentage change from to  is due to increased activity in in the extended government vertical in the united states  resulting from a higher customer demand for our digital certificate solutions in that market sector 
extended government revenues  which include healthcare  generated in the united states increased from million in to million in  or 
in and  no individual customer accounted for or more of revenues 
in  a single customer accounted for of revenues  while no other customers accounted for or more of revenues 
the united states and canadian governments represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively  when including revenues sold through resellers to the government end users 
however  direct sales to the united states and canadian governments represented only  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
license revenues 
license revenues of million in represented a decrease of from the million in  which in turn  represented a decrease of from the million in these revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in license revenues in absolute dollars in primarily reflected the changed buying patterns that we experienced during the twelve month period  with customers delaying purchases as a result of the soft economic climate internationally and concerns over the war in iraq 
in addition  new project purchases remained subject to governmental budgetary constraints  particularly in the united states 
in addition  the global downturn has had a significant impact on information technology projects from through and the commitments that customers have made to expenditures in this area  with customers buying for their immediate needs  as opposed to buying total project or enterprise wide 
highlighting this trend  we had license revenue transactions a license revenue transaction is defined as a license sale in excess of thousand in  down from in  or a decrease  which in turn was down from license revenue transactions in  or a decrease of 
the impact on revenue from to was partially offset by the fact that the average license revenue transaction size increased from thousand in to thousand in  or an increase of 
however  the average license revenue transaction size decreased to thousand in  or a decrease of from in general  the top five average quarterly license revenue transactions as a percentage of total revenues declined from and in and  respectively to in this decline reflects a lower volume of software license transactions representing greater than million in license revenue in compared to and in addition  experienced a significant decrease in license revenues in canada  compared to and  which included million and million  respectively  of revenues from software deliveries accounted for on a subscription basis relating to the government of canada secure channel project 
these revenues have not been fully replaced 
license revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased in compared to due to a stronger demand for services  primarily maintenance and support services  relative to the demand for software  reflecting the shift from new project software spending to service driven deployment and maintenance 
license revenues as a percentage of total revenues remained flat from to  due to decreased services and maintenance revenues in the first half of  largely as a result of the timing delay in contracting additional services revenues from the government of canada secure channel project  coupled with continued demand for the entrust secure web portal solutions and enterprise desktop suite  offset 
table of contents by decreased license revenues caused by the greatly reduced government of canada secure channel software revenues in services and maintenance revenues 
services and maintenance revenues of million in represented a decrease of from the million in  which in turn  represented a decrease of from the million in these revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in services and maintenance revenues from to was due primarily to continued pressure on information technology services spending 
however  support revenues  which is a component of services and maintenance revenues  and related support contract renewals in continued to be at the highest levels in our history  representing a million increase over this helped to offset the effect of the decline in spending of million by customers on professional services in  as compared to we believe this support revenue performance reflects the value of our products provided to our customers globally  the increasing customer deployment of our solutions  and the level of service quality that our support and maintenance team delivers 
the decrease in services and maintenance revenues from to was due to slowed demand for consulting services  resulting from the diminished growth of the license revenue base of customers experienced during and and the timing of corresponding support contract renewals on this license revenue base 
consulting services revenues declined from million in to million in and million in in addition  to a greater degree  we have been fulfilling our customers deployment needs in and in conjunction with partners  as our solutions are now easier to deploy and consequently  the demand for our consulting services relating to customer deployment and integration requirements has declined accordingly in these years 
this was particularly true in europe  where several large system integration contracts in europe underpinned the services revenues in the first half of that year 
however  these revenues were not replaced in and the increase in services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in compared to reflected the shift in the mix of revenues from license to services and maintenance revenues discussed in the previous section 
this shift was largely due to the strength of demand for our services and maintenance business relative to the demand for software  with license revenues declining year over year while services and maintenance revenues declined only 
services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues for compared to remained flat  mainly due to the continued improvements achieved in the utilization of our global professional services organization  offset with a shift in the mix of revenues from services and maintenance to license revenues during the first half of this shift was largely due to an increase in demand for our enhanced security solutions  particularly the entrust secure web portal solutions  combined with the decrease in services and maintenance business in as a result of the timing of customer demand 
total expenses total expenses consist of costs of revenues and operating expenses associated with sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  impairment of purchased products rights and restructuring charges 
total expenses of million in represented an increase of from million in as a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars  our expense base increased by million in  when compared to  due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states and canadian dollars 
in addition  we incurred million of restructuring and impairment charges in  which represented an increase of million from the reduction of restructuring charges of million recorded in however  tighter spending discipline and the restructuring announced in may resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of million 
as of december   we had full time employees globally  compared to full time employees at december  no employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements 
cost of revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of costs associated with product media  documentation  packaging and royalties to third party software vendors 
cost of license revenues was 
table of contents million in  million in and million in  representing of total revenues for each of the respective years 
while the cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent from to  the minimal change in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars was the net result of lower software license revenues in  compared to  offset by an increase in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars in from incremental third party royalties 
the million increase in third party royalties was primarily due to the first sales of our new secure identity management solution in the second half of  which incorporates third party technology 
this more than offset the million decrease in third party royalties associated with the lower level of license revenues in the decrease in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars from to was primarily a result of lower license revenues in which lowered the corresponding royalty expenses by million compared to the prior year and savings of million realized as a result of renegotiated royalty agreements with some third party software vendors 
the cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent when comparing to due to the overall lower total revenues in the mix of third party products and the relative gross margins achieved with respect to these products may vary from period to period and from transaction to transaction and  consequently  our gross margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
cost of services and maintenance revenues 
cost of services and maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel costs associated with customer support  training and consulting services  as well as amounts paid to third party consulting firms for those services 
cost of services and maintenance revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues for the respective years 
the decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars from to primarily reflected the decreased costs resulting from our may restructuring  which was intended to reduce our cost structure to reflect the lower levels of services and maintenance revenues experienced during these costs decreased million in when compared to as a result of the lower level of services revenues  in addition to the savings of million in resulting from actions taken in our restructuring 
these decreases were offset by increased investment in our support and maintenance team of million in the decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in primarily reflected decreased costs of million associated with lower levels of services and maintenance revenues experienced during and the elimination of certain unprofitable services business lines as part of our restructuring in june  which resulted in savings of million in the increase in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in reflected the lower than expected software revenue performance in  particularly as a result of the reduced closure rate for software transactions  and the shift in the mix of revenues from license to services and maintenance revenues during the year when compared to  whereby services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in as the services and maintenance revenues represented the larger proportion of total revenues and declined less than total revenues  the cost of generating those services and maintenance revenues represented a much larger percentage when compared against total revenues 
services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues was in  in and in the increase in services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues in  compared to  was primarily due to improved support revenues and support contract renewals  which continue to be at the highest levels in our history  and resulted in higher margin attainment by the support and maintenance team 
these increases in support and maintenance revenues accounted for a five percentage point increase in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues in when compared to however  professional services margins declined  which resulted in an offsetting two percentage point decrease in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues in  compared to the increase in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues from to reflected the lower costs associated with professional services and operating efficiencies achieved in the form of higher productivity and utilization of available services resources compared to the previous year  combined with a shift in the services revenues mix from lower margin professional services revenues to higher margin support 
table of contents and maintenance revenues 
each of these factors resulted in a one percentage point improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues 
we also eliminated certain unprofitable services business lines as part of our restructuring plan in june  which resulted in a four percentage point improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues 
we plan to continue to optimize the utilization of existing professional services resources  while addressing significant incremental customer opportunities that may arise in the near future with the help of partners and other sub contractors  until the investment in additional full time resources is justifiable 
this may have an adverse impact on the gross profit for services and maintenance  as the gross profit realized by using partners and sub contractors is generally lower 
the mix of services and maintenance revenues may vary from period to period and from transaction to transaction and  consequently  our gross margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
operating expenses operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in absolute dollars from to was due mainly to continued management discipline with respect to spending  which resulted in savings of million in  in addition to expense reductions as a result of our may restructuring plan of million 
we also experienced lower expenses related to sales commissions of million due to the lower revenue achievement in compared to this was partially offset by a million bad debt charge recorded in the second quarter of the decrease in absolute dollars in from was primarily the result of the cost reduction strategies implemented through our june restructuring plan  as well as the non recurring nature of the million of charges incurred in connection with implementation of our restructuring plan in since the june restructuring  our sales and marketing expenses have better matched our revenue generation 
however  until that time in  we had continued to make significant investments in sales and marketing to support the launch of new products  markets  services and marketing programs 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for  compared to  was the net effect of the savings realized through our may restructuring and through reduced spending  which decreased sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues by nine percentage points  offset by a six percentage point increase as a result of lower revenue achievement during compared to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues in  compared to  reflected the cost savings from the june restructuring plan  and the lower than expected revenue achievement in the first half of compared to in addition  we had continued to implement significant efficiencies into our sales processes and continue greater discipline in expense management as we streamlined the sales and marketing organizations 
the cost savings from the restructuring accounted for approximately percentage points of the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues  while the lower revenue achievement in resulted in a five percentage point increase 
the efficiencies and discipline implemented in our sales processes accounted for a four percentage point decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
we intend to continue to focus on improving the productivity of these organizations with a view to gaining efficiencies in the related processes in light of current economic conditions 
however  we believe it is necessary for us to continue to make significant investments in sales and marketing to support the launch of new products  services and marketing programs by maintaining our strategy of a investing in hiring and training our direct and partner sales organizations in anticipation of future market growth  and b investing in marketing efforts in support of new product launches 
we feel it is necessary to invest in marketing programs that will improve the awareness and understanding of information security governance  and will work with and support the business software alliance information security governance task force toward that goal 
failure to make such investments could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
while we are focused on marketing programs and revenue generating opportunities to increase software revenues  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will be successful 
during  the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million to million  with the increase being recorded as a bad debt expense in the second quarter of the increase related to one 
table of contents particular customer receivable balance  and is not indicative of an overall decline in the quality of our accounts receivable 
generally  we experienced effective cash collections throughout during  the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by million as a result of better cash collections during the period and  consequently  an additional bad debt expense was not required in due to the changes in the economic environment and the impact of the june restructuring program  particularly the curtailment of certain products and presence in certain geographies  we recorded bad debt write offs and additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts totaling million in operating expenses research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
research and development expenses in absolute dollars for declined only slightly from this was the net result of increased costs of million in from costs associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations between canada  where the majority of these costs are incurred  and the united states  offset by the effects of the implementation of our may restructuring  which resulted in million of savings in in addition  we incurred increased compensation costs of million in the second half of  compared to the same period of  related to the existing research and development staff 
the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in from to was due mainly to the cost reduction strategies implemented through our june restructuring plan 
in addition  employees were hired during the first half of  primarily in connection with the continuing expansion and enhancement of our product offerings and our commitment to quality assurance and testing  and globalization of these product offerings 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for increased compared to  mainly due to the lower than expected license revenues during the year  while these costs were largely fixed at spending levels based upon higher budgeted revenues  which represented a four percentage point increase 
this was offset by a two percentage point decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues from reduced spending as a result of the may restructuring 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for decreased compared to due mainly to the lower research and development spending resulting from a reprioritization of resources to our principal products  coupled with continued management discipline in operating expenses in we believe that we must continue to maintain our investment in research and development in order to protect our technological leadership position  software quality and security assurance leadership 
we therefore expect that research and development expenses may have to increase in absolute dollars in the future if additional experienced security experts and software engineers are required 
operating expenses general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and decreased from million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars decreased from to  due mainly to continued management discipline in these areas  which meant savings of million  and the implementation of our restructuring plan in the second quarter of  which resulted in reduced spending of million in  compared to general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars decreased from to  primarily as a result of the million of special non recurring charges recorded as part of our june restructuring program 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues have remained relatively flat from to  despite the reduction of spending in this area  due to the lower revenue achievement during  and the fact that these expenses include a high degree of fixed costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased in  compared to  due primarily to the million of non recurring charges incurred in related to our june restructuring program  which represented a five percentage point decrease  while lower revenue attainment in accounted for a two percentage point increase 
we continue to look for ways to gain additional efficiencies in our administrative processes and to contain expenses in these functional areas 

table of contents amortization of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles and impairment of purchased product rights amortization of purchased product rights of thousand was recorded in no amortization expense was recorded with respect to the purchase product rights after the second quarter of  as this asset had been fully amortized or impaired by the end of that quarter 
amortization of purchased product rights of million was recorded in no amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles assets was recorded as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in january the amortization of purchased product rights is recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
as a result of actions undertaken in the restructuring in the second quarter of coupled with the commercial release of a next generation software product  we reviewed the estimated future cash flows from the developed technology acquired from encommerce 
based on these events  the net present value of the estimated future cash flows from the purchased product rights was negative 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge related to this asset in the amount of the remaining carrying value of million in the second quarter of  as we determined the asset had minimal fair value 
restructuring and other special non recurring charges may restructuring plan following the first quarter of  when our revenue attainment fell short of our expectations and guidance  we began a re assessment of our operations to ensure that our expenses were optimally aligned to our customers and markets  and structured such that we could achieve our financial break even target for the fourth quarter of on may   we announced a restructuring plan aimed at lowering costs and better aligning our resources to customer needs 
the plan allows us to have tighter integration between the groups in our organization that interact with customers  which better positions us to take advantage of the market opportunities for our new products 
the restructuring plan included the elimination of employee positions through layoffs and attrition to lower operating costs  the closing of under utilized office space and reassessing the useful life of related excess long lived assets  and review of the realizability of developed technology impacted by the restructuring 
the workforce portion included severance and related costs of million for positions from all functional areas and had been completed by december  the consolidation of under utilized facilities included costs relating to lease obligations through the first quarter of primarily from excess space in our santa clara  california and addison  texas facilities  and accelerated amortization of related leaseholds and equipment 
the facilities plan was executed by september  and  as a result  we recorded million of charges during relating to these facilities  including million for accelerated amortization on leaseholds and equipment whose estimated useful lives had been impacted by the plan to cease using the related excess space in our facilities 
the total amount of the workforce and facilities charges was million 
of this amount  million had been incurred by june  and charged to the restructuring charges line in the consolidated statement of operations for the second quarter of  while the remaining million was recorded in the third quarter of the restructuring resulted in a reduction of all expense lines including total cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses

the restructuring program included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
the restructuring resulted in the elimination of over positions  or approximately of our total work force

as of june  we had initiated all actions required by the restructuring plan 
in addition  we recorded a million adjustment in the second quarter of to reflect a reduction in the accruals for special non recurring charges  related to the discontinuance of non core products and programs due to savings realized in completing contractual obligations offset by increased legal and other costs incurred to realize these savings 
no further adjustments were required in the restructuring plan announced on june  was completed by june no further charges are anticipated 
however  actual results could vary from the currently recorded estimates 
the following paragraphs provide information relating to the june restructuring plan that resulted in the total special charges listed above 
workforce reduction and other personnel costs the restructuring program resulted in the reduction of approximately of our regular full time employees  or of the total workforce 
the reduction was across all major geographic locations  all business programs and all functions within the organization 
the reductions were more heavily weighted in sales and marketing  non core business programs such as entrust 
net and entrust yourservice and non core geographies such as asia pacific and latin america 
the majority of the affected employees were notified of their termination in the second quarter of  and the workforce portion of the restructuring was largely completed by the end of the fourth quarter of we recorded a cumulative workforce reduction charge of million primarily related to severance costs  fringe benefits due to severed employees and outplacement services 

table of contents other special non recurring charges included employee relocation expenses  hiring fees and signing bonuses totaling million on a cumulative basis  which were recorded primarily in general and administrative expenses 
consolidation of excess facilities we recorded cumulative restructuring costs of million relating to the consolidation of excess facilities 
the consolidation of excess facilities included a total of eight offices in seven cities throughout the world 
the costs for consolidation of excess facilities were related primarily to non cancelable lease costs offset by estimated sublet recoveries 
the majority approximately of the costs were related to a  square foot facility in santa clara  california 
the santa clara facility costs are payable contractually over the remaining term of the lease  which runs through we will continue to evaluate ongoing possibilities to settle this obligation in the most economic manner 
in addition to the cumulative million of restructuring costs related to excess facilities  an additional million of facilities related costs were recorded  on a cumulative basis  as a special non recurring charge as a result of impairment of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment that was disposed of or removed from operations as a result of the consolidation of excess facilities  and were included in the write down of leaseholds and other long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
these assets were identified as assets to be disposed of that would have no future benefit to us 
therefore  these assets were reported at the lower of carrying amount and fair value  less costs of disposition 
the majority of these costs are non cash charges 
discontinuance of non core products and programs in support of the restructuring objective to reduce costs and focus on our core technologies  we discontinued several non core products and programs 
the discontinued products and programs  totaling million on a cumulative basis  were primarily related to our services business initiatives and to certain desktop applications that did not achieve the growth and profitability targets in line with our core products and financial objectives 
the restructuring charge also included costs related to the exit of certain marketing events and programs that had been committed to prior to the restructuring  but which were being cancelled due to the change in corporate focus 
the cash outflow related to the majority of these items was substantially incurred by the end of the second quarter of fiscal accrued estimated marketing and distribution agreement obligations of million which were due through  relating to certain discontinued products  were settled in the discontinuance of products and programs  and expenses related to rebranding of our identity and our products  resulted in million of cumulative special non recurring charges  which was primarily recorded in sales and marketing expenses

table of contents december  total charges accrued at beginning of year cash payments adjustments accrued restructuring charges at end of year in millions workforce reduction and other personnel costs consolidation of excess facilities discontinuance of non core products and programs total in july  we signed a settlement and general release agreement with zix corporation  that resulted in the remaining contractual obligation under the company s marketing and distribution agreement with zix corporation being settled at a value significantly less than the accrued million obligation at june  under the settlement agreement  we paid zix corporation thousand in july to fulfill all remaining obligations 
this settlement resulted in the reversal of an accrual of million  which was recorded through the restructuring charges line in our consolidated statement of operations  in in connection with the may restructuring plan  which included a further reduction in space utilized at our santa clara  california facility  we reviewed market sublease rates in that region 
based on information supplied to us by our external real estate advisors  we concluded that the sublease market would not recover in the timeframe that we had originally estimated due to the continued softening of sublease rates in that market  requiring an adjustment to increase the facility related accrual recorded in june  by million 
this adjustment was charged to the restructuring charges line in the consolidated statement of operations in impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other intangible purchased assets due to the decline in our market capitalization  the decline in current overall business conditions within our target market segments and the restructuring program  we completed an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill on our balance sheet as of june  in accordance with apb opinion no 
and the relevant guidance in sfas no 
this impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of the goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangible assets of the encommerce and r acquisitions would not be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
we then completed an analysis of the discounted future cash flows from the encommerce acquisition and the r acquisition 
the result of this analysis was a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangible assets 
goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles from the encommerce acquisition accounted for million of the impairment 
this acquisition failed to meet the financial planning forecasts made at the time of the acquisition due largely to the change in the economic conditions since the time of the acquisition and in part due to additional product development and maintenance costs related to the getaccess product that were estimated to be required in the future and were not known at the time of the acquisition 
the remaining million of goodwill impairment in was the result of the r acquisition  which was impacted primarily by the workforce restructuring 
we recorded an additional impairment charge in related to the purchased product rights  obtained in the encommerce acquisition  in the amount of the remaining carrying value of million  as we determined the asset had minimal fair value 
this was the result of actions undertaken in the may restructuring coupled with the commercial release of a next generation software product 
we reviewed the estimated future cash flows from the developed technology acquired from encommerce and based on these events  the net present value of the estimated future cash flows from the purchased product rights was negative 

table of contents write down of long term strategic investments we recorded charges related to other than temporary declines in the value of certain strategic investments of million in during  we recorded additional impairments of million 
these impairments were related to our investments in several different companies  which were fully impaired due to insolvency after having been partially impaired in one investment was impaired due to an other than temporary decline in value which was triggered by a significant impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the company 
as of december   we had recorded a total of million of impairments with respect to our long term strategic investments 
we recorded a non cash charge in related to the impairment of a long term strategic investment made in brazil in fiscal due to a decline in market conditions and a restructuring of the investee by its management  we concluded that the investment had suffered an other than temporary decline in fair value as determined by third party market transactions  and as such  we recorded an impairment in the second quarter of of million 
as a result  we have no remaining balance of long term strategic investments as of december  interest income interest income decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in investment income from through  reflected the reduced balance of funds invested  as these amounts have been drawn down to fund cash flow from operations and stock repurchases and to acquire long lived assets 
the funds invested decreased to million at december  from million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  the decrease was due to the lower interest rates that have been available in and  compared to the preceding years 
in and  the rate of return on our marketable investments dropped to less than compared to our historical rate of return of just under on an annualized basis 
loss from equity investment we recorded thousand of losses related to our investment in entrust japan for  compared to thousand for this investment is accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  since we have the potential to significantly influence the operations and management of entrust japan 
the losses recorded in represent our share of the operating losses of entrust japan for this period on an equity accounting basis  based on an approximate ownership interest in the voting capital of entrust japan 
the losses recorded in represent our share of the operating losses of entrust japan for  based on an approximate and ownership interest in the voting capital of entrust japan in the first and remaining quarters of  respectively 
we included our share of post acquisition losses of entrust japan on the step by step acquisition method in our consolidated losses for  and accordingly  included our share of entrust japan s first quarter operating losses  in addition to our share of their second  third and fourth quarter losses  in our operating results 
in addition  we made a retroactive adjustment to consolidated accumulated deficit to record our share of the post acquisition losses of entrust japan of prior years  attributable to the less than ownership prior to the increased investment  to the extent of our previous investment of thousand 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in  compared to million in and million in these provisions represent primarily the taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the effective income tax rates differed from statutory rates primarily due to the non deductibility of amortization and impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangible assets and long term strategic investments  as well as an adjustment of the valuation allowance that has offset the tax benefits from the significant net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available 

table of contents quarterly results of operations our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
in particular  our period to period operating results are significantly dependent upon the completion date of large license agreements 
in this regard  the purchase of our products often requires a significant capital investment  which customers may view as a discretionary cost and  therefore  a purchase that can be deferred or canceled due to budgetary or other business reasons 
estimating future revenues is also difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  therefore  we do not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues are heavily dependent upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we have generally recorded a significant portion of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we expect these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  quarterly license revenues are dependent on the timing of revenue recognition  which can be affected by many factors  including the timing of customer installations and acceptance 
in these regards  we have from time to time experienced delays in recognizing revenues with respect to certain orders 
in any period a significant portion of our revenue may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers 
despite the uncertainties in our revenue patterns  our operating expenses are based upon anticipated revenue levels and such expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis throughout the quarter 
as a result  if expected revenues are delayed or otherwise not realized in a quarter for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected in a significant way 
under our restructuring program in may  as discussed earlier  the levels of operating expenses decreased and the net loss decreased in the third and fourth quarters of the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters in the two year period ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
these data have been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report

our average days sales outstanding at december  was days  which represents a decrease from the days that we reported at december  the overall decrease in days sales outstanding from december  was mainly due to better collections in coupled with the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts from the previous year and a slightly better linearity of revenues during the last quarter of any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and days sales outstanding will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as the timing of when sales are invoiced and length of 
table of contents customer s payment cycle 
generally  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers  so that an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our days sales outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
due to the current economic climate  we may observe an increase in the length of our customers payment cycle  which may result in higher accounts receivable balances  and could expose us to greater general credit risks with our customers and increased bad debt expense 
for purposes of calculating average days sales outstanding  we divide ending accounts receivable by the current quarter s revenues and multiply this amount by days 
the level of accounts receivable at each quarter end will be affected by the concentration of revenues in the final weeks of each quarter and may be negatively affected by expanded international revenues in relation to total revenues as licenses to international customers often have longer payment terms 
during  we generated million of cash in investing activities  primarily due to cash provided by reductions in our marketable investments in the amount of million net of million of marketable investment purchases 
this was partially offset by million invested in property and equipment primarily for computer hardware upgrades throughout our organization and million invested in other long term assets related to capitalized software development costs 
we used cash of million for financing activities in  primarily for the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of million  offset by cash provided by the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments in the amount of million provided our principal sources of liquidity 
overall  we used million from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments in although we continue to target operating breakeven  based on sustaining current revenue and operating expense structures  we estimate that we will continue to use cash in fiscal to satisfy the obligations accrued for under our restructuring program 
however  if operating losses do occur  then cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be negatively affected 
in addition  we announced in the third quarter of that we intend to repurchase up to an aggregate of million shares of our common stock over the month period ending july   or an earlier date determined by our board of directors  in open market  negotiated or block transactions 
in july  we announced that our board of directors had agreed to extend the expiry date of the stock repurchase program to september  and to permit the new purchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock in addition to the  shares already purchased 
the timing and amount of shares repurchased under this program will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market and business conditions  and will be funded using available working capital 
since the announcement of the program  we have repurchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
while there can be no assurance as to the extent of usage of liquid resources in future periods  we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
in terms of long term liquidity requirements  we will need to fund the million of accrued restructuring charges at december  through fiscal  as detailed below 
this amount is net of estimated sublet recoveries on restructured facilities of million 
the lease obligations included in these accrued restructuring charges are disclosed in the table of contractual commitments below 
in addition  they are classified as short term in nature on the financial statements because the company is continuing to evaluate possibilities to settle this obligation in the most economic manner 
in addition  we forecast a requirement to spend approximately million per year into the foreseeable future on capital expenditures  primarily for computer equipment needed to replace existing equipment that is coming to the end of its useful life 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  as well as future operating cash flows  will be sufficient capital resources to fund these long term requirements 

table of contents we have commitments that will expire at various times through we lease administrative and sales offices and certain property and equipment under non cancelable operating leases that will expire in with certain renewal options 
otherwise  we had no other significant contractual obligations or commitments that were not recorded in our financial statements 
a summary of our contractual commitments at december  is as follows as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations currently utilized facilities operating lease obligations restructured facilities other contractual obligations total in addition to the lease commitments included above  we have provided letters of credit totaling million as security deposits in connection with certain office leases 
on september   we entered into an agreement with ohana wireless  incorporated  a california corporation ohana  whereby we advanced ohana million in the form of a zero interest convertible loan 
ohana was formed in july to design  assemble and install high frequency wireless communication systems 
we believe that out security solutions can be integrated with ohana s products and we anticipate that an investment in ohana will assist us in furthering the development of our distribution capability in asia through technology and distribution partnerships 
ohana intends to close on a series a preferred stock financing by july  upon the closing of that financing  the loan will automatically convert to series a preferred stock 
if the closing does not occur on or before july   the convertible loan will be payable to us on july  however  this agreement also includes an obligation to enter into good faith negotiations to invest up to an additional million in ohana if  as a result of negotiations with china aerospace international holdings  inc  we enter into a resale or distribution arrangement in china 
we enter into standard indemnification agreements with our business partners or customers in our ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  we agree to modify  repair or replace the product  pay royalties for a right to use  defend and reimburse the indemnified party for actual damages awarded by a court against the indemnified party for an intellectual property infringement claim by a third party with respect to our products and services 
the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we enter into standard indemnification agreements with our customers  whereby we indemnify them for certain damages  such as personal property damage  which may be caused in connection with consulting services performed at a customer site by our employees or our subcontractors 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  we have general and umbrella insurance policies that enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we generally warrant for ninety days from delivery to a customer that our software products will perform free from material errors which prevent performance in accordance with user documentation 
additionally  we 
table of contents warrant that our consulting services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards 
we have never incurred significant expense under our product or service warranties 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of our obligations under these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we have entered into employment and executive retention agreements with certain employees and executive officers  which  among other things  include certain severance and change of control provisions 
we have also entered into agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
certain factors that may affect our business our quarterly revenues and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and such fluctuations may lead to a reduced market price for our stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  but securities analysts and investors often rely upon these comparisons as indicators of future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  or the guidance that we provide  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
factors that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past and which are likely to affect us in the future include the following reduced capital expenditures for software  length of sales cycles associated with our product offerings  the timing  size and nature of our licensing transactions  the increased dependency on partners for end user fulfillment  market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us  market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by our competitors  the relative proportions of revenues derived from licenses and services and maintenance  the timing of new personnel hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  changes in pricing policies by our competitors  changes in our operating expenses  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and reduced spending by critical vertical markets 
estimating future revenues is difficult  and our failure to do so accurately may lead to a reduced market price for our stock and reduced profitability 
estimating future revenues is difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  as such  we do not have a significant order backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues depend heavily upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we historically have recorded to of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of revenues in the second half of that month 
we expect that this concentration of revenues  which is attributable in part to the tendency of some customers to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter and to sales patterns within the software industry  will continue 

table of contents our expense levels are based  in significant part  upon our expectations as to future revenues and are largely fixed in the short term 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations could have an immediate and significant effect on our profitability for that quarter and may lead to a reduced market price for our stock 
because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle associated with our large software transactions  we may not succeed in closing transactions on a timely basis or at all  which would adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
transactions for our solutions often involve large expenditures  and the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable 
factors affecting the sales cycle include customers budgetary constraints  particularly in a soft economic environment where technology spending is often deferred  the timing of customers budget cycles  and customers internal approval processes 
we may not succeed in closing such large transactions on a timely basis or at all  which could cause significant variability in our revenues and results of operations for any particular period 
if our results of operations and cash flows fall below the expectations of securities analysts  or below the targeted guidance range that we have provided  our stock price may decline 
a limited number of customers has accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues  which may decline if we cannot maintain or replace these customer relationships 
historically  a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
in  and  our three largest customers accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of large customers 
in addition  we anticipate that such customers will continue to vary over time  so that the achievement of our long term goals will require us to obtain additional significant customers on an ongoing basis 
our failure to enter into a sufficient number of large licensing agreements during a particular period could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
the us and canadian federal governments account for a significant percentage of our revenues  which may decline or be subject to delays  which would adversely affect our operating results 
the extended government vertical governments  including healthcare accounted for of our software revenue in and of software revenue in the us and canadian governments represented and of total revenues  respectively  in  which includes revenues sold through resellers to these government end users 
sustaining and growing revenues in the government market will depend  in large part  on the following the adoption rate of our products within government departments and agencies  the timing and amount of budget appropriations for information technology and specifically information security  the timing of adoption of information security policies and regulations  including  but not limited to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  the gramm leach bliley act and the california breach disclosure law sb  and 
table of contents our ability to develop and maintain the appropriate business relationships with partners with whom the government contracts for information security projects 
a decline  or delay in the growth of this market could reduce demand for our products  adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  failure to properly monitor pricing on government contracts could result in liability for penalties to the government for non compliance 
we sometimes enter into complex contracts  which require ongoing monitoring and administration 
failure to monitor and administer these contracts properly could result in liability or damages 
we sometimes enter into complex contracts with our government customers that contain clauses that provide that if a customer who falls within a specific category known as a relevant customer is offered better terms on the company s software products and related services that had been offered to the government customer  then the government customer will be able to buy additional quantities of those software products and services for the same length of time  from the same effective date and on the better terms that were offered to the relevant customer 
the company monitors compliance with these contracts on a continuous basis 
the company also conducts periodic self assessments to ensure that the contracts are being properly administered and that there are no accruing liabilities for non compliance 
if these contracts are not properly monitored and administered  they may be breached and could result in damages payable by us which  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the outbreak of war  significant threat of war  or a terrorist act could adversely affect our business 
historically  the outbreak of war has had an adverse affect upon the economy 
in the event of war or significant terrorist act  any of the following may occur government spending could be reprioritized to wartime activities  global enterprise spending budgets could be cut or delayed resulting in lower demand for our products  or widespread and unprecedented acts of cyber terrorism could cause disruption of communications and technology infrastructures  which could impact our customers of products and could have unforeseen economic impacts 
a decline or delay in economic spending due to the outbreak of war  significant threat of war or a terrorist act could reduce demand for our products  materially adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations 
if the enterprise information technology budgets and the digital identity security market do not continue to grow  demand for our products and services will be adversely affected 
the market for digital identity and information security solutions is at an early stage of development 
continued growth of the digital identity security market will depend  in large part  on the following the continued expansion of internet usage and the number of organizations adopting or expanding intranets and extranets  the rate of adoption of internet based business applications such as web services  the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the public recognition of the potential threat posed by computer hackers and other unauthorized users  and 
table of contents the continued development of new and improved services for implementation across the internet  intranets and extranets 
a decline in the growth of this market could reduce demand for our products  adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations 
a breach of security at one of our customers  whether or not due to our products  could harm our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
the processes used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks and intranets are rapidly evolving 
a well publicized actual or perceived breach of network or computer security at one of our customers  regardless of whether such breach is attributable to our products  third party technology used within our products or any significant advance in techniques for decoding or cracking encrypted information  could adversely affect the market s perception of us and our products  and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products 
in addition  the security level of our products is dependent upon the processes and procedures used to install and operate our products 
failure on the part of our customers to properly install and operate our products  could cause a security breach  which could adversely affect the market s perception of us and our products  and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products 
as our products contain errors or bugs  sales of our products would likely decline if some of these bugs or the number of bugs were significant 
like virtually all software systems  our products contain errors  failures or bugs that our existing testing procedures have not detected 
the errors may become evident at any time during the life of our products 
the discovery of any errors  failures or bugs in any products  including third party technology incorporated into our products  may result in adverse publicity  product returns  the loss or delay of market acceptance of our products  and third party claims against us 
accordingly  the discovery of any errors  failures or bugs would have a significant adverse effect on the sales of our products and our results of operations 
we have invested in technology companies in the start up or development stage whose products and technology may not succeed with the result that we lose all or substantially all of our investments 
we have invested in several privately held companies  most of which are technology companies in the start up or development stage  or are companies with technologies and products that are targeted at geographically distant markets 
if the demand for the technologies and products offered by these privately held companies materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in relevant markets  we could lose all or substantially all of our investments in these companies 
our revenues may decline if we cannot compete successfully in an intensely competitive market 
we target our products at the rapidly evolving market for digital identity and information security solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than we do 
as a 
table of contents result  they may be able to react more quickly to emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  certain of our current competitors in particular segments of the security marketplace may in the future broaden or enhance their offerings to provide a more comprehensive solution competing more fully with our functionality 
increased competition and increased market volatility in our industry could result in lower prices  reduced margins or the failure of our products and services to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could have a serious adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business will not be successful if we do not keep up with the rapid changes in our industry 
the emerging market for digital identity and information security products and related services is characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
to be competitive  we have to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings  and be first to market with new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services 
our failure to develop and introduce new products and services successfully on a timely basis and to achieve market acceptance for such products and services could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have difficulty managing our operations  which could adversely affect our ability to successfully grow our business 
our ability to manage future growth  if any  will depend upon our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis  and expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our operations 
the geographic dispersal of our operations  including the separation of our headquarters in addison  texas  from our research and development facilities in ottawa  canada  and santa clara  california and from our european headquarters in reading  united kingdom  may make it more difficult to manage our growth 
if we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
our future success depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the field of cryptography  and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key scientific  technical  sales and managerial employees or that we can attract  motivate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
these challenges are made more severe by our history of operating losses  the employment reductions from our restructurings  and the fact that the exercise price of the substantial majority of outstanding stock options is below the current market price of our stock 
if we cannot retain or are unable to hire such key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights  which could make us less competitive and cause us to lose market share 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect these rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  nondisclosure agreements  shrink wrap licenses and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products  
table of contents obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  or infringe upon our patents 
policing piracy and other unauthorized use of our products is difficult  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
in addition  third parties might successfully design around our patents or obtain patents that we would need to license or design around 
finally  the protections we have obtained may not be sufficient because some courts have held that shrink wrap licenses  because they are not signed by the licensee  are not enforceable  our trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and patents may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information  and we may not seek additional patents on our technology or products and such patents  even if obtained  may not be broad enough to protect our technology or products 
our inability or failure to protect our proprietary rights could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  while actions taken to enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially increase our quarterly expenses 
we have been subject to  and may in the future become subject to  intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention 
as the number of security products in the industry and the functionality of these products further overlaps  software developers and publishers may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others 
from time to time  we have received notices from third parties either soliciting our interest in obtaining a license under one or more patents owned or licensed by these third parties or suggesting that our products may be infringing one or more patents owned or licensed by these third parties 
from time to time  we have received notices from various customers stating that we may be responsible for indemnifying such customers pursuant to indemnification obligations in product license agreements with such customers for alleged infringement of patents assigned to third parties 
to date  we are not aware that any customer has filed an action against us for indemnification 
in addition  third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future 
defending or enforcing our intellectual property could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a successful claim against us could also have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which damages are paid 
additionally  as a result of a successful claim  we could potentially be enjoined from using technology that is required for our products to remain competitive which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations for subsequent periods 
we may lose access to technology that we license from outside vendors  which loss could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we rely on outside licensors for patent and or software license rights in technology that is incorporated into and is necessary for the operation of our products 
for example  our ability to provide web server certificates in the future is dependent upon a licensing agreement we have with baltimore technologies  one of our primary competitors 
our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to such technologies that are or may become important to the functionality of our products 
any inability to continue to procure or use such technology could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to sell some of our products 

table of contents we rely on partners to integrate our products with their products and to resell our products 
changes in these relationships could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we rely on partners to integrate our products with their products or to maintain adherence to industry standards so that our products will be able to work with them to provide enhanced security attributes 
for example  our ability to provide digital signatures on adobe forms is dependent upon adobe continuing to allow entrust to have access to their private application programming interfaces in future releases 
in addition  we have resale relationships with companies such as critical path and waveset 
inability to maintain these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
future acquisitions or investments could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
it is possible  as part of our future growth strategy  that we will from time to time acquire or make investments in companies  technologies  product solutions or professional services offerings 
with respect to these acquisitions  we would face the difficulties of assimilating personnel and operations from the acquired businesses and the problems of retaining and motivating key personnel from such businesses 
in addition  these acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day business  increase our expenses and adversely impact our results of operations 
any future acquisitions would involve certain other risks  including the assumption of additional liabilities  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and incurrence of debt 
in addition  these types of transactions often result in charges to earnings for such items as amortization of goodwill or in process research and development expenses 
as a result of our june and may restructuring plans  we have made certain assumptions in estimating the accrued restructuring charges 
if these assumptions change  they could have a material effect on our reported results 
in recent periods  we announced two major restructuring plans in june and in may as a result of the slowdown in the global electronics industry and the worldwide economy 
the restructuring plans included a workforce reduction  the consolidation of excess facilities  the reassessment of the value of related excess long lived assets and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
as a result of the june restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring and other special non recurring charges  excluding goodwill impairment  of million in the second quarter of our assessment of the accounting effects of the june restructuring plan required assumptions in estimating the original accrued restructuring charges  including estimating future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  liabilities from employee severances  and costs to exit business activities 
changes in these assumptions  with respect to the accrued restructuring charges for the june restructuring plan of million at december   could have a material effect on our reported results 
as a result of the may restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring charges  excluding impairments  of million 
our assessment of the accounting effect of the may restructuring plan required assumptions in estimating the original incurred and expected restructuring charges of million  including estimating liabilities from employee severances  future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  and other costs to exit activities 
changes in these assumptions  with respect to the accrued restructuring charges for the may restructuring plan of million at december   could have a material effect on our reported results 
if our business does not improve or declines  we may further restructure our operations  which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we may need to take additional restructuring charges in the future if our business does not improve or declines or if the expected benefits of the restructuring plans do not materialize 
these benefits may not 
table of contents materialize if we incur unanticipated costs in closing facilities or transitioning operations from closed facilities to other facilities or if customers cancel orders as a result of facility closures 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our restructuring plans  we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs  which may adversely affect our operating results 
we face risks associated with our international operations  which  if not managed properly  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the future  we may establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and establish relationships with additional partners internationally 
this expansion would require significant management attention and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although our international sales currently are primarily denominated in us dollars  we may increasingly denominate sales in foreign currencies in the future 
in addition  our international business may be subject to the following risks difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  difficulties in obtaining us export licenses  especially for products containing encryption technology  potentially longer payment cycles for customer payments  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  difficulties managing personnel  partners and operations in remote locations  and increased complexity in global corporate tax structure 
any one of these could significantly and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face additional risks in the asia pacific market due to our reliance on joint ventures and other factors 
in japan  we have an exclusive distribution arrangement with secom and others called entrust japan co  ltd 
this entity is a joint venture of which we own  secom  a japanese security company  owns  and a group of other investors own the remaining 
joint ventures have additional risks as a result of potentially conflicting objectives between the owners including  but not limited to  agreement on business plans  budgets  and key staffing decisions 
also  another outbreak of sars in the region could have an impact on our ability to travel to  and work with  customers in the region 
these restrictions could affect our ability to transact business in the region 
if the laws regarding exports of our products further limit or otherwise restrict our business  we could be prohibited from shipping our products to restricted countries  which would result in a loss of revenues 
some of our products are subject to export controls under laws of the us  canada and other countries 
the list of products and countries for which exports are restricted  and the relevant regulatory policies  are likely to be revised from time to time 
if we cannot obtain required government approvals under these regulations  we may not be able to sell products abroad or make products available for sale internationally via computer networks such as the internet 
furthermore  us governmental controls on the exportation of encryption products and technology may in the future restrict our ability to freely export some of our products with the most powerful information security encryption technology 

table of contents our stock price is volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is expected to continue to be  highly volatile and may be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products introduced by  or new contracts entered into by  us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents  copyrights or propriety rights  conditions and trends in the security industry  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and general market conditions and other factors 
provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that are in your best interests 
our charter and bylaws contain provisions  including a staggered board of directors that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or may discourage bids to do so 
we think these measures enable us to review offers for our shares of common stock to determine if they are in the best interests of our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk associated with interest rates our investment policy states that we will invest our cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  in investments that are designed to preserve principal  maintain liquidity and maximize return 
we actively manage our investments in accordance with these objectives 
some of these investments are subject to interest rate risk  whereby a change in market interest rates will cause the principal amount of the underlying investment to fluctuate 
therefore  depreciation in principal value of an investment is possible in situations where the investment is made at a fixed interest rate and the market interest rate then subsequently increases 
we try to manage this risk by maintaining our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments with high quality financial institutions and investment managers 
as a result  we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rates is minimal 

table of contents the following table presents the cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments that we held at december  and  that would have been subject to interest rate risk  and the related ranges of maturities as of those dates december  december  maturity maturity within months months months months within months months months months in thousands investments classified as cash and cash equivalents investments classified as held to maturity marketable investments total amortized cost fair value risk associated with exchange rates we are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates  specifically between the united states and canada  the united kingdom  and the european union 
this exposure is not considered to be material with respect to the united kingdom and european operations due to the fact that these operations are not significant 
however  because a disproportionate amount of our expenses are denominated in canadian dollars  through the company s canadian operations  while our canadian denominated revenue streams are cyclical  we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the canadian dollar  and in particular  fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar 
therefore  a favorable change in the exchange rate for the canadian subsidiary would result in higher revenues when translated into us dollars  but the expenses would be higher in a corresponding fashion and to a greater degree 
historically  we have not engaged in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses is minimized 
however  as a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars  our expense base increased by million in  when compared to  due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states and canadian dollars 
during the fourth quarter of  we engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars  covering exposures on approximately million of our canadian subsidiary s expenses denominated in canadian dollars  in an attempt to reduce earnings volatility that might result from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollar 
none of the related foreign exchange contracts extended past december  similarly  the company has engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars covering exposures on approximately million of expenses denominated in canadian dollars in the first quarter of risk associated with equity investments we have invested in several privately held companies  most of which are technology companies in the start up or development stage  or are companies with technologies and products that are targeted at geographically distant markets 
if the demand for the technologies and products offered by these privately held companies materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant markets  we could lose all or substantially all of our investments in these companies 
from through the end of  we recorded losses of million from impairments and a realized gain of million from dispositions in connection with these investments 
we recorded million of these impairments in during  we recorded an additional impairment of million related to these strategic equity investments 
there is no net book value remaining for these strategic equity investments as of december  
table of contents we also have a long term investment in entrust japan  which is accounted for in accordance with the equity method 
we recorded our share of post acquisition losses of entrust japan  in the amount of thousand and thousand in our consolidated losses for and  respectively  resulting in cumulative losses recorded to date of million 
these losses are attributable to our pro rata share of entrust japan s losses in and  while we had an equity ownership of approximately of their voting stock 
during  entrust japan exceeded the performance targets established at the date of increased investment 
however  in  the actual growth of entrust japan was less than the original projections 
it is possible that future growth will also fall short of projections  and due to entrust japan s history of operating losses  it is possible that all or substantially all of the remaining million equity investment in entrust japan at december  may be expensed through our operating earnings in future quarters as a result of our recognition of our equity share of losses in entrust japan 
as of december   we believe that there had not been an impairment of our investment in entrust japan 
however  there are risks associated with joint venture investments  including failure to agree on budgets  market plans  staffing decisions and changes in strategic direction by one of the partners 
if any one of these were to occur  the value of our investment in entrust japan could be further adversely affected
