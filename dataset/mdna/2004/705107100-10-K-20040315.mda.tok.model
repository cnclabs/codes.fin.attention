in  our revenues were adversely affected by the late passage and signing of both the and federal civilian budgets 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees for consulting services 
we generate these fees from contracts with various payment arrangements  including time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts and cost reimbursable contracts 
during  revenues from these contract types were approximately  and  respectively  of total revenues 
we expect this approximate mix of business to continue in we typically issue invoices monthly to manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we recognize revenues on time and materials contracts as the services are provided 
we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method as services are performed over the life of the contract  based on the costs we incur in relation to the total estimated costs 
we recognize and make provisions for any anticipated contract losses 
however  if the contract has a service element  revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
in certain arrangements  we enter into contracts that include the delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design  development or modification of systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and systems provided to the client 
such contracts are divided into separate units of accounting and the total arrangement fee is allocated to each unit based on its relative fair value 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
fixed price contracts are attractive to clients  and while subject to increased risks  provide opportunities for increased margins 
we recognize revenue on cost reimbursable contracts as services are provided 
these revenues are equal to the costs incurred in providing these services plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
while our margins are lower on cost reimbursable contracts we have historically recovered all of our costs on these contracts  which means we have lower risk 
our historical revenue growth is attributable to various factors  including an increase in the size and number of projects for existing and new clients 
existing clients from the previous fiscal year generated approximately of our revenues in  approximately of our revenues in and approximately of our revenues in we manage our client development efforts through each of our strategic service groups  each having specific client responsibility and focus 
as of december   we had  personnel and on february  we had xx personnel 
in  we derived approximately of our revenue through relationships with prime contractors  which contract directly with the end client and subcontract with us 
with the exception of the eds nmci subcontract  in most of these engagements  we retain full responsibility for the end client relationship and direct and manage the activities of our contract staff 
during  we had one customer that accounted for more than of our total revenue 
the drug enforcement agency dea special projects division accounted for of the revenue 
our most significant expense is direct costs  which consist primarily of project personnel salaries and benefits  and direct expenses incurred to complete projects 
our direct costs as a percentage of revenues are also related to the utilization rate of our consulting employees 
we manage utilization by frequently monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consulting employees assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our executive management  finance and administrative groups  human resources  unassigned consulting employees  employee training  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization  travel and all other branch and corporate costs 
sales and marketing expenses include the costs of sales and marketing personnel and costs associated with marketing and bidding on future projects 
other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and income from our investment in our corporate headquarters building 
acquisitions on august   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of viking for million cash plus the assumption of debt in a business combination accounted for as a purchase 
viking was a provider of integrated software and advanced technology solutions to state and local law enforcement  fire  and emergency medical service agencies 
the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets was approximately million 
at the time of the acquisition  viking had personnel 
on november   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of troy for million of cash and common stock valued at million in a business combination accounted for as a purchase

vector was a provider of technology development and engineering services to the federal government 
the excess of purchase price over fair value of the net assets was approximately million

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting the assets and liabilities including contingent assets and liabilities reported at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported for the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  current data  information related to performance and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those measurements that are most affected by management s estimates of future events are revenue recognition 
our revenue is derived primarily from contracts with the federal government 
in  and    of our contracts were fixed priced contracts 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage of costs incurred in the applicable reporting period compared to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss is recorded in the period 
however  if the contract has a service element  revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
in certain arrangements  we enter into contracts that include the delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design  development or modification of systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and systems provided to the client 
such contracts are divided into separate units of accounting and the total arrangement fee is allocated to each unit based on its relative fair value 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
depreciation and amortization periods for long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine the recoverability of long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future estimated undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
if the future estimated undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets  then such assets are written down to their fair value 
we have not identified any events or circumstances that indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be fully recoverable 
realization values of various assets such as receivables and goodwill 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management s best estimate of probable losses based on historical experience  known troubled accounts and other currently available information 
allowances are established for specific receivables when deemed appropriate 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying value 
we completed our annual impairment test and concluded goodwill was not impaired 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  or if an event occurs  or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying value  we may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges

it also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in an arrangement 
eitf does not apply to deliverables in arrangements to the extent the accounting for such deliverables are within the scope of other existing higher level authoritative accounting literature

on december   the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements

as we had already adopted eitf  the change has no effect on our financial position

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 fin was issued

investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of risk 
fixed securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our company s future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates could have approximately a  impact on our interest income 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the board of directors 
under this policy no investment securities can have maturities exceeding two years and the average duration of the portfolio cannot exceed months
