overview firstwave is a leading provider of crm solutions to mid size and large scale enterprises worldwide 
firstwave s corporate and product mission reflects our customer first commitment to develop and integrate the best software solutions to manage customer interactions and information 
as a provider of sports and high tech crm  firstwave offers a suite of industry focused solutions 
firstwave crm is adaptive  scalable and easily integrates with existing systems 
headquartered in atlanta  georgia  with an office in surrey  england  firstwave supports several product lines firstwave crm includes ecrm and v 
products  firstwave sports  firstwave technology connect care and takecontrol 
on march   firstwave acquired connect care  inc a provider of crm software solutions for software companies 
in exchange for all outstanding shares of connect care stock  firstwave issued  shares of firstwave common stock  with a market value of  to the shareholders of connect care and granted such shareholders certain registration rights 
the results of connect care s operations have been included in the company s financial statements since march  the company has recently announced agreements with three sports organizations  sports coach uk  championsworld llc  and all england lawn tennis croquet club aeltc for wimbledon championships 
sports coach uk is the uk s leading coaching authority and has selected firstwave to provide its crm and coaching management solution 
championsworld is a major us based sports promoter and chose firstwave to provide a fan management solution and support to its event management needs 
the agreement with championsworld has a recurring revenue component under which firstwave expects to receive revenue from tickets and fan memberships annually over the next four years 
aeltc intends to use firstwave for its overall event administration 
the sports coach uk and championsworld agreements were signed in december  and the agreement with aeltc was signed in while we are unable to give any assurance that we will recognize substantial revenues in the future  we believe that the combination of these three agreements has the potential to allow us to generate significant revenue cumulatively over the next four years 
because we are not yet able to anticipate with any certainty the revenues that we may generate under these agreements  this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion section  does not include any projected revenues from these agreements 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected financial data and the percentages of our net revenues represented by each line item presented 
it also sets forth the percentage change in each line item presented from to certain percentage columns do not add to due to rounding 
year ended december  year ended december  change in thousands of revenue of revenue to revenues software services maintenance other net revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues software services maintenance other sales and marketing product development general administrative total operating cost and exp operating income loss interest income  net income loss before income taxes in general  competition in the software industry has increasingly been characterized by shortening product cycles 
no assurance can be given that we will be immune to this trend 
if the product cycle for our systems proves to be shorter than management anticipates  our pricing structure and revenues could be impaired 
in addition  in order to remain competitive  we may be required to expend a greater percentage of our revenues on product innovation and development than has historically been the case 
in either case  our gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see certain factors affecting forward looking statements in part i  item of this annual report 
compared to revenue total revenues  which includes software license fees  services  and maintenance  decreased from  in to  in primarily due to a decrease in services revenues partially offset by increases in software revenues and maintenance revenues 
license fees  hourly rates for services and maintenance fees were not increased in the increases in software revenues and maintenance revenues are attributable to increases in the volume of software licenses sold and maintenance performed 
none of the increases in software revenues and maintenance revenues was attributed to increases in price 
software revenues increased from  in to  in as a result of increased sales of the firstwave crm products  including firstwave sports  our new sports and entertainment solution  and firstwave technology  the software offering available as a result of the connect care acquisition 
our software revenues are significantly dependent upon the timing of closing of license agreements  and current quarterly results may not be indicative of future performance 
total revenues from international sources decreased from of total revenues in to in due to decreased services revenue from our uk subsidiary and increased total revenues from us operations 
revenues from international software licenses increased from  in to  in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in due to increased software sales by our uk subsidiary and total lower revenues for the company in revenues from firstwave uk contributed all international revenues 
no revenue was derived from international distributors during  as compared to  in the decrease in revenue derived from international distributors is related to the decreased use of our takecontrol product by international customers which  due to the age and life cycle of the product  was expected 
revenues and associated costs from international distributors were immaterial to the company s overall financial statements as they represented none of the gross margin in and only of the gross margin in although we have begun renewing our relationships with distributors in europe and australia and look forward to activity from these distributors  there has been limited activity thus far 
during  we expect revenue derived from us sources to continue to increase and we expect a decrease in uk total revenues relative to levels due to the successful completion of the multi year services project with electronic data systems  ltd 
services revenues decreased from  in to  in the decrease in services revenues is primarily due to decreases in two large services engagements 
these two engagements represented of our total services revenues for while one of these projects continued into  the scale of services decreased compared to representing of total services revenues for the company has successfully completed a multi year services project  and the company s services revenues will significantly decrease if not replaced with other customer projects or if we do not successfully diversify the sources of our revenues pursuant to our business strategies 
our services revenues are subject to fluctuations based on variations of the length and number of active service engagements in a given quarter 
the strategies for transitioning our revenue stream away from dependence on a few large customers include acquisition of companies with customer bases bringing in recurring maintenance revenues and a potential for upgrade licenses and services revenues 
the connect care acquisition of march  was the first such acquisition to help diversify our revenue stream 
we are also focusing on vertical markets to increase the prospects in our pipeline with targeted companies for our solutions 
our vertical markets include high tech companies and sports associations 
during the fourth quarter of  the first full quarter after its release  champions world llc and sportscoach uk were two organizations that licensed first sports 
another strategy we are pursuing to diversify our revenues is the recruitment of strategic alliances and resellers for leads and channel distribution of our software 
maintenance revenues increased from  in to  in the increase is due to the addition of maintenance revenue from the connect care acquisition and additional maintenance revenues associated with additional software revenues from the crm product line 
maintenance revenues are the result of renewal agreements from previous software license agreements as well as new license agreements 
during  we expect maintenance revenues to increase slightly as we increase license revenues with our crm products 
the results of operations of firstwave technologies uk ltd are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the subsidiary are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
during  the average foreign currency exchange rate increased compared to exchange rates during this rate increase accounted for approximately  in total revenue during the average foreign currency exchange rate during increased compared to exchange rates during this rate increase accounted for an increase of revenue of approximately  during the average foreign currency exchange rate during decreased compared to exchange rates during this rate decrease accounted for a decrease of revenue of approximately  in cost of revenue costs of software revenues increased from  in to  in and as a percentage of software revenue decreased from in to in the decrease of costs of software as a percentage of software revenue is primarily the result of the relatively consistent amounts of capitalized software amortization costs of  during and  in  with increased software revenues for  resulting in an increase in the software revenue margin 
costs of software revenues include costs of third party software  amortization of capitalized software  and costs of packaging  media and documentation 
amortization of capitalized software represented of total cost of software revenues during  compared to in for  we anticipate amortization expense to remain the significant majority of cost of software 
costs of revenues for services decreased from  in to  in the decrease is a result of decreases in outside consultants and bundled travel associated with the decrease in services revenue 
costs of revenues for services as a percentage of services revenues increased from in to in primarily due to certain fixed personnel costs  which at lower revenue levels result in a decrease in the services revenue margin 
costs of revenues for maintenance increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily due to increased payroll costs related to additional personnel from the connect care acquisition 
this increase in costs is consistent with increased maintenance revenue 
costs of revenues for maintenance as a percentage of maintenance revenues decreased from in to in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses increased from  in to  in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in the increase in expense is attributed to increases in payroll costs and telemarketing services 
during  we anticipate continued increases in sales and marketing expenses as we continue to implement marketing programs focused on creating awareness  generating qualified leads  and development of new marketing channels 
if the resulting projected revenues do not increase as quickly as expected  or at the rate we expect  we may experience an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
product development expense the company s product innovation and development expenditures which consist principally of salaries  contract services  and certain other expenses related to development and modifications of software products  including amounts capitalized  increased from  in to  in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in software development costs capitalized increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily related to increased payroll costs related to an increase in development personnel and fees associated with outside contractors related to the development of our latest version of the crm product including the new sports and entertainment offering  firstwave sports

in the fall of  firstwave contracted with extreme logic for services to assist our development efforts 
such partnership continued through june of central to this effort is the firstwave ide 
the firstwave ide is an application code generation tool that can be used to generate microsoft 
net applications using a non programming paradigm 
this product will continue to be enhanced and extended as part of the development effort 
as part of the effort related to the crm product line  the latest generation  firstwave crm was released in june of firstwave sports was launched in october of this product provides crm functionality to the sports and entertainment marketplace

based on an original equipment manufacturer oem agreement between firstwave and business objects  firstwave analytics will provide both crm and sports and entertainment customers a reporting and analytic environment 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to the connect care acquisition and increases in employee benefits  insurance  and professional fees  offset by a favorable change in the foreign currency translation rate during the year 
net interest income net interest income decreased from  in to  in while the company had no interest expense in  the interest expense for is related to the company s  line of credit with rbc centura 
the company had borrowings of  against the line of credit at december   and year to date interest related to the line of credit totaled approximately  income tax expense income tax expense was  in related to withholding tax on an international cash receipt compared to no income tax expense in in  income tax expense generated from net income was completely offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards as opposed to the current year s net loss

our software revenues are significantly dependent upon the timing of closing of license agreements 
revenues from international software licenses increased from  in to  in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in due to increased software sales by our uk subsidiary 
total revenues from international sources  which includes maintenance  software license fees and customizations  increased from of total revenues in to in due to increased software and services revenue from our uk subsidiary 
revenues from firstwave uk contributed the majority of international revenues with only a nominal amount of revenue derived from international distributors 
the decrease in revenue derived from international distributors is related to the decreased use of our takecontrol product by international customers 
services revenues increased from  in to  in the increase in services revenue was primarily due to two large services engagements 
both of these engagements  handled by our uk subsidiary  represented of our total services revenues for the increases in license and services revenues from to were attributable to increases in the volume of software licenses sold and services performed 
during  we did not increase our price per licensed software user  or our hourly rate for professional services 
these volume increases in software and services revenues were primarily due to revenues generated through our uk subsidiary and our partnership with a leading global services company 
maintenance revenues decreased from  in to  in primarily as the result of cancellations of maintenance agreements of customers who were using the takecontrol and firstwave for unix product lines 
maintenance revenues are the result of renewal agreements from previous software license sales as well as new license agreements 
during  we experienced increased maintenance revenues related to the crm product  which related to new software license sales  and as expected  decreased maintenance revenue from the takecontrol and unix product lines 
the results of operations of our wholly owned subsidiary located in surrey  england are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the subsidiary are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations

the cost of software revenue decreased while software revenue increased  which resulted in the cost being a lower percentage of revenue 
costs of software revenues included costs of third party software  amortization of capitalized software  and costs of packaging  media and documentation 
amortization of capitalized software represented of total cost of software revenues during  compared to in costs of revenues for services increased from  in to  in the increases were a result of increases in payroll  outside consultants  and bundled travel consistent with the increase in services revenue 
costs of revenues for services as a percentage of services revenues decreased from in to in due to higher utilization rates of service personnel 
costs of revenues for maintenance decreased from  in to  in the decrease in maintenance cost was related to decreased royalty costs consistent with decreased maintenance revenues generated by international distributors 
costs of revenues for maintenance as a percentage of maintenance revenues decreased from in to in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses increased from  in to  in  but decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in the increase in expense was attributed to increases in payroll costs due to the expansion of the sales team as well as increases in telemarketing services and public relations 
product development expense the company s product innovation and development expenditures  which included amounts capitalized  increased from  in to  in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in software development costs capitalized increased from  in to  in the increase was primarily related to increased payroll costs related to an increase in development personnel and increased used of outside consultants related to enhancements to the crm product line

net version of our crm product in the fall of in partnership with extreme logic 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in primarily due to a favorable change in the foreign currency translation rate during the year 
net interest income expense net interest income increased from  in net interest expense in to  in net interest income in balance sheet net accounts receivable decreased from  at december  to  at december  consistent with lower total revenues during fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter the allowance for doubtful accounts increased from  at december  to  at december  primarily due to increased reserves related to sales to connect care customers subsequent to the acquisition and increased reserve related to customers of firstwave uk 
other assets increased from  at december  to  at december  due to the prepayment of third party license royalties and prepaid marketing expenses 
property and equipment decreased from  at december  to  at december  due to fixed asset purchases offset by year to date depreciation and disposals 
capitalized software increased from  at december  to  at december  due to additional capitalization of  in development costs net of  in amortization 
during we anticipate a decrease in this asset  as we are expecting the amortization to exceed expected amounts of additional capitalization in intangible assets of  at december  relate to the  acquisition of connect care technology and customer relationship intangibles  net of  in amortization expense 
goodwill increased from  at december  to  at december  due to the connect care acquisition 
accounts payable decreased from  at december  to  at december  at december   accounts payable included a large balance with extreme logic  an outside consultant agency working on a development project that was completed in therefore  there was no similar balance at december  sales tax payable decreased from  at december  to  at december  primarily due to a decrease of accrued vat payable in the uk consistent with decreased revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of deferred revenue increased from  at december  to  at december  due to increased annual maintenance billings related to the crm product line and maintenance and professional services billings revenues associated with the additional customer base acquired in the connect care acquisition 
the annual maintenance fees will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  and the professional services fees will be recognized as services revenues when the work is performed 
accrued employee compensation and benefits decreased from  at december  to  at december  due to decreased accruals related to incentives and commissions consistent with decreased software revenues for fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter and the company s lower financial performance which is a component in incentive calculations 
borrowings at december  were  due to the initial draw on the company s line of credit with rbc centura 
the company had no debt at december  other accrued liabilities increased from  at december  to  at december  primarily due to the timing of payments related to payroll withholdings 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  a decrease of over the cash balance of  at december  the decreased cash balance is primarily due to lower total revenues while the company continued to invest in its technology and sales and marketing efforts 
during  of our total revenue was attributed to our relationship with electronic data systems ltd  a leading global services company 
during  this same relationship accounted for of total revenues 
the company has successfully completed the multi year services project with this customer

in addition  the company will be required to maintain a minimum cash balance in principal depository accounts with rbc of at least  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to obtain positive cash flows  market acceptance of our products  and the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing 
our future capital needs will be highly dependent upon our ability to control expenses and generate additional software license revenues  and any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if we are unable to fund expenses from operations or obtain the necessary additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  as well as reduce the size of current staff  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and ability to reduce losses or generate profits 
we capitalized  in software development costs during  as compared to  during these amounts relate to continued development and enhancements to our firstwave crm product including the development of our new sports and entertainment solution  firstwave sports

in the ordinary course of business the company leases certain real properties and equipment as disclosed in note in the notes to financial statements 
contractual obligations at december   our outstanding contractual obligations included in thousands less than one year greater than one year to three years total rbc borrowings lease commitments total critical accounting policies the company believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  and related interpretations 
software revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product when the company has a signed contract  the fees are fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
the company accrues for estimated warranty costs at the time it recognizes revenue 
the company s products are licensed on a per user model  except for hosting services 
in accordance with paragraph of sop  license revenues under the per user model are recognized under the company s revenue recognition polices when revenue recognition criteria are met 
hosting services are priced as a monthly or yearly fixed amount based upon number of users  and are recognized as hosting services revenues ratably by month over the period of service 
hosting services revenues are consolidated into services revenues on the company s financial statements 
services revenue is recognized as services are performed 
our software product is able to function independently in a customer s environment without additional services 
our training  implementation  and customization services are optional services to our customers and are not necessary for the functioning of the software product 
our software is offered as a stand alone product 
it can be implemented with minimal services 
the essential functionality of the software  such as database support and maintenance  preparation of marketing campaigns  and standard workflow  is functional and can be utilized by the customer upon installation as intended by the customer 
at a customer s request  the software can also be implemented with additional services  such as data conversion and workflow modifications  which are not significant to the functionality of the software  but rather tailor features to most effectively function in the customer s environment 
the revenue for the customization or implementation services is recognized as the services are provided and earned 
revenue is allocated to software and services based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair values 
because the software is a stand alone product that can be used for the customer s purpose upon installation  and because any services performed have insignificant effect on the functionality of the software  services revenue is accounted for separately in accordance with paragraph of sop the company has not recorded any unbilled receivables related to implementation and customization service revenues  and the company has accounted for any implementation and customization service revenues that have been billed as the services were performed  in accordance with paragraphs and of sop the company has arrangements with customers that provide for the delivery of multiple elements  including software licenses and services 
the company allocates and recognizes revenue related to each of the multiple elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element and when there are no undelivered elements essential to the functionality of the delivered element 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on standard pricing for each of the elements in our multiple element arrangements 
revenue associated with the various elements of multiple element arrangements is based on such vendor specific objective evidence as the price charged for each element is the same as when the element would be sold separately from any other element 
standard pricing does not vary by customer or by duration  or by requirements of the arrangement 
international revenues are primarily generated by firstwave uk and independent distributors who offer licenses of the company s products in specific geographic areas 
during  under the terms of the company s international distributor agreements  international distributors collected license fees and maintenance revenues on behalf of the company  and remitted to of standard license fees and maintenance revenues they produced 
pursuant to eitf  the company recognizes these distributor sales at the gross license amount because the company retains title to the products  holds the risk and rewards of ownership  such as risk of loss for collection  and responsibility for providing the product to the customer 
the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining the pricing of the product and performs any source code changes to the product 
the independent distributors are considered agents of the company and work on a commission basis 
the commissions paid are reflected as a selling expense in the company s financial statements 
the maintenance fees generated by distributor revenues are reflected as maintenance revenues  with the amount retained by distributors shown as a cost of maintenance revenue 
there were no international distributor revenues in  compared to  in revenues from non monetary exchanges are recorded at the fair value of the products and services provided or received  whichever is more clearly evident 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into an agreement with a customer to exchange a total of  in software licenses  services  and maintenance in exchange for marketing sponsorships at future sporting events 
the revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of on this transaction was  in software revenues and  in deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue will be recognized as services revenues when the services are performed and as maintenance revenues ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
the prepaid marketing expense of  is reflected in other assets on the company s balance sheet and will be shown as marketing expense when the company participates in sponsorships at future sporting events 
this transaction is indicative of a trend that may continue where some of the revenue generated by our sports solution will be non monetary exchanges for future sponsorship marketing expenses 
maintenance revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the maintenance agreements 
advanced billings for services and maintenance contracts are recorded as deferred revenue on the company s balance sheet  with revenue recognized as the services are performed and on a pro rata basis over the term of the maintenance agreements 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s estimate of receivables that will be uncollectible 
the estimate is based on historical charge off activity and current account status 
the company s us accounting management oversees reporting procedures in the uk and monitors their transactions on a timely basis 
the us management reviews transactions and sales contracts as such transactions and sales are occurring to ensure that revenues are recognized under the company s revenue recognition policy and that expenses and other transactions are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
management of the uk subsidiary reports directly to us management  with us management substantially involved in all aspects of uk operations 
as such  us management has established procedures to insure that international revenues are recognized properly and on a timely basis 
software development costs capitalized software development costs consist principally of salaries  contract services  and certain other expenses related to development and modifications of software products capitalized in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
capitalization of such costs begins only upon establishment of technological feasibility as defined in sfas and ends when the resulting product is available for sale 
the company evaluates the establishment of technological feasibility based on the existence of a working model of the software product 
capitalized costs may include costs related to product enhancements resulting in new features and increased functionality as well as writing the code in a new programming language 
since version enhancements are built on an already detailed design under an existing source code  technological feasibility is established early for each version 
all costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of software products are classified as research and development and are expensed as incurred 
the company evaluates the realizability of unamortized capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date 
software development costs which are capitalized are subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
if the unamortized capitalized software cost exceeds the net realizable value of the asset  the amount would be written off accordingly 
the net realizable value of the capitalized software development costs is the estimated future gross revenues of the software product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
amortization of capitalized software costs is provided at the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is not more than three years 
it is possible that those estimates of anticipated product revenues  the remaining estimated economic life of the product  or both could be reduced due to changing technologies 
the amortization of software development costs is presented as a cost of software revenue in the company s financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas no goodwill and other intangible assets  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives must be tested periodically for impairment 
examples of management s judgment regarding the existence of impairment of an intangible asset and the resulting fair value  would include management s assessment of adverse changes in legal factors  market conditions  or loss of key personnel 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is determined to be in excess of the carrying value  the company would record an impairment loss 
sfas no prescribes a two phase approach for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary measures the impairment 
the company completed its annual analysis during the fourth quarter of and found no instance of impairment of its recorded goodwill 
therefore  no further action was required

quarterly financial data unaudited the table below sets forth certain unaudited operating results for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended december  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
our operating results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
quarter ended in thousands  except per share amounts net revenues operating income loss net income loss net income loss applicable to common shareholders basic earnings loss per share diluted earnings loss per share software revenue decreased from  in the fourth quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of primarily due to a large license agreement in the fourth quarter of our software revenues are significantly dependent upon the size and timing of closing of license agreements 
services revenues decreased from  in the fourth quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of primarily due to the completion of a multi year services project 
our services revenues are subject to fluctuations based on length and number of active engagements in a given quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities  including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
currently  the company maintains its cash position primarily in money market funds and other bank accounts 
the company does not currently engage in hedging activities or otherwise use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its financial assets 
although a decrease in interest rates could reduce our interest income  management does not believe a change in interest rates will materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations in the company has a variable interest rate on its current line of credit which bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
due to the amount of the borrowings and the short term nature of the debt  we do not believe we have a significant risk due to potential fluctuations in interest rates for loans at this time 
changes in interest rates could make it more costly to borrow money in the future and may impede our future acquisition and growth strategies if management determines that the costs associated with borrowing funds are too high to implement these strategies 
the results of operations of firstwave technologies  uk ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary located in surrey  england  are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of this subsidiary are translated from the local currency to us dollars upon consolidation 
because of the significance of the operations of this subsidiary to our consolidated operations  as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from our prior performance and our expectations 
in addition  because of the significance of our overseas operations  we could also be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products and further negatively impact the results of our operations in a material and adverse manner 
as a result of these market risks  the price of our stock could decline significantly and rapidly 
the company manages the risk by monitoring on a regular basis the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as they relate to our uk subsidiary  and attempts to take action if the foreign currency exchange rate would result in a material impact to the company s financial statements upon translation from the local currency  the british pound  to the us dollar 
the action taken in these instances by the company is to move the currency from the uk subsidiary to the company s headquarters when doing so would be beneficial to the company 
the foreign currency that the company transfers to the united states comes from the operations of the uk subsidiary in the normal course of business 
since the uk subsidiary has recognized the majority of the revenues generated by the company in  it also  therefore  has collected the majority of the payments for those revenues 
after covering the expenses to operate the subsidiary  the company has had excess currency in the uk 
these transactions are not economic hedges of a net investment in the uk subsidiary and are not intercompany transactions of a long term nature 
the cash payments from the uk subsidiary to the us parent are payments against a short term intercompany account 
the intercompany account represents items owed to the us parent for royalty charges and intercompany charges assessed on the uk subsidiary 
these items are intercompany in nature and are eliminated in the consolidation of the company s financial statements 
cash payments against the intercompany balance are made regularly by the uk subsidiary to the us parent 
the company tries to time the actual payments from the uk subsidiary to the us parent to occur when the currency exchange rate of british pounds to us dollars is strong  thus yielding favorable conversion results 
the intercompany account charges are denominated in uk currency  converted to us dollars  and eliminated in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the exchange risk to the company is if the exchange rate decreases  the carrying value of the intercompany balance decreases and results in a charge against income 
the tax consequences of this intercompany activity is that the us parent recognizes income on the us corporate tax return for the intercompany charges assessed on the uk subsidiary 
the company does not engage in any hedging activities 
as foreign currency exchange rates vary  the fluctuations in revenues and expenses may materially impact the financial statements upon consolidation 
a weaker us dollar would result in an increase to revenues and expenses upon consolidation  and a stronger us dollar would result in a decrease to revenues and expenses upon consolidation
