the company does not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results 
item business overview mgi pharma  inc 
mgi or company is an oncology focused biopharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and commercializes proprietary pharmaceutical products that meet cancer patient needs 
it is our goal to become a leader in oncology through application of our three core competencies of oncology product acquisition  development and commercialization  which we apply toward our portfolio of oncology products and product candidates 
we acquire intellectual property or product rights from others after they have completed the basic research to discover the compounds that will become our product candidates or marketed products 
this allows us to focus our skills on product development and commercialization rather than directly performing drug discovery 
we currently market several cancer related products in the united states using our person oncology focused sales organization 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenues for a breakdown of sales by product over the last three years 
we focus our sales efforts solely within the united states  where we have retained product rights to our currently marketed products and product candidates under development 
we create alliances with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the sales and marketing of our products in other countries 
see note to the financial statements for further information on revenues attributable to us and foreign customers 
we began promotion of aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection in september in the united states for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting cinv 
we market salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride in the united states to oncologists as a treatment for the symptoms of radiation induced dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients and to rheumatologists as a treatment for dry mouth associated with the autoimmune disease sj gren s syndrome 
historically  the cash flow generated from the us sales of salagen tablets has been the primary source of funding for our selling  general and administrative activities 
sales of salagen tablets accounted for approximately percent of our million of product sales in in march we began direct promotion  or face to face sales calls  of hexalen capsules after acquiring the hexalen capsules business in november hexalen capsules are a second line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer patients who are refractory to first line therapies 
we believe we have a complementary portfolio of oncology product candidates 
our current product candidates are at various stages with an emphasis on advanced stages of development and are intended to have diverse roles in treating cancer patients 
our portfolio includes therapeutic and supportive care product candidates 
on november   we and helsinn healthcare sa announced an expansion of our exclusive united states and canada license and distribution agreement to include rights for the post operative nausea and vomiting ponv application of aloxi injection and an oral aloxi formulation 
phase studies of aloxi injection for prevention of ponv indicated that aloxi injection was safe and well tolerated 
we expect phase trials to begin in for use of aloxi injection in the prevention of ponv and the oral aloxi formulation 
irofulven  the lead cancer therapy product candidate from our proprietary family of compounds  called acylfulvenes  is in a series of clinical trials 
based on our analysis of results from our trials of irofulven  we believe that irofulven is adequately tolerated for a chemotherapeutic  with evidence of monotherapy activity against a wide range of cancers including liver  pancreatic  ovarian  and prostate tumors 
these results have been seen in patients with refractory tumors  meaning tumors that are unresponsive to first line chemotherapy 
trials in refractory cancer patients are the usual way to begin development of new chemotherapy agents  followed by trials comparing the activity of currently approved therapies to the investigational chemotherapy agent 
if the investigational chemotherapy agent establishes improved safety and or efficacy compared to the established therapy  regulatory approval may be sought 
we also are conducting a series of phase dose escalation trials of irofulven in combination therapy with currently approved cancer agents 
we believe that an advantage of combination therapy is the potential to achieve better anti cancer benefit with an acceptable side effect profile compared to either agent used as single agents 
in preclinical studies  irofulven has demonstrated synergistic activity with a number of marketed chemotherapies  meaning the extent of tumor cell death was greater than would be predicted by simply adding the activity of each agent individually 
the most promising combination therapy clinical activity has been observed in colorectal  hormone refractory prostate  and thyroid cancers 
we plan to initiate phase combination studies of irofulven in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer during as a potential path toward u 
s food and drug administration fda registration 
throughout phase and monotherapy and combination therapy trials  consistent evidence of clinical activity in hormone refractory prostate cancer hrpc has been reported  including activity in patients previously exposed to chemotherapy 
phase data presented at the th annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology asco in indicated that irofulven in combination with prednisone  a steroid  induced decreases of more than percent in prostate specific antigen psa levels  in percent of evaluable patients and disease stabilization in percent of patients evaluable for objective tumor response 
psa is a blood marker used by clinicians for treatment decisions 
activity has also been shown in prostate cancer patients treated with irofulven plus the marketed chemotherapies  capecitabine or cisplatin  in phase trials 
following comprehensive analysis of our available data  we are preparing to initiate a phase combination program for irofulven in hrpc patients previously treated with docetaxel 
most hrpc patients in the united states who are receiving chemotherapy are treated with docetaxel  and we believe significant unmet need exists among prostate cancer patients who have failed hormone therapy and who have progressed on docetaxel

the key elements of our strategy are to capitalize on early launch progress to continue to successfully commercialize aloxi injection for prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting cinv 
we intend to aggressively market aloxi injection as an enhanced alternative to currently marketed ht receptor antagonists indicated for prevention of cinv 
expand the aloxi franchise by developing aloxi injection for prevention of post operative nausea and vomiting ponv and by developing an oral aloxi formulation for nausea and vomiting 
phase trials of aloxi injection for prevention of ponv and of an oral aloxi formulation are expected to initiate in selectively add to our product portfolio through various means  including product acquisition  in licensing  co promotion or business combinations 
we intend to focus our product acquisition efforts on currently marketed pharmaceutical products or product candidates for which we believe we can effectively add value through our commercial and development capabilities 
advance the irofulven clinical program  including initiation of a phase hrpc program during the second quarter of collaborate with international biopharmaceutical companies outside the united states to develop and commercialize our current products and product candidates when we have international product rights 
cancer overview according to the american cancer society  or acs  there are approximately million new cases of cancer diagnosed in the united states each year 
cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states and is projected to result in approximately  deaths in the united states in cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells 
these abnormal or malignant cells accumulate and form tumors that can compress  invade and destroy normal tissue 
if malignant cells break away from the primary tumor  they can travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system to other areas of the body 
there they may settle and form new tumors 
the spread of a tumor to a new site is called metastasis 
different types of cancer vary in their rates of growth and patterns of spread  and  consequently  typically respond in varying degrees to different types of treatment 
the three most common forms of treatment for cancer in order of their typical use are surgery the physical removal of a patient s tumor mass  radiation therapy the use of high energy particles or waves  such as x rays or gamma rays  to destroy or damage cancer cells  and chemotherapy the use of drugs to inhibit the growth of or kill cancer cells 
systemic chemotherapy uses cancer therapy drugs that are administered intravenously or orally 
these drugs enter the bloodstream and can potentially reach all areas of the body  which make this treatment especially useful for cancer that has metastasized 
a cancer patient often receives a combination of treatments depending upon the type and progression of the disease 
while surgery attempts to remove the cancer from the patient and radiation attempts to kill the cancer cells  there are significant limitations and complications associated with these treatments that result in high rates of treatment failure 
this failure is due primarily to metastasis and dose limiting severe side effects 
chemotherapeutic agents attempt to address the limitations of surgery and radiation  which are local treatments  by interfering with the replication of cancer cells that may have spread to distant sites in the patient 
in addition to treatment of their cancer  cancer patients often need supportive care to prevent or treat the side effects of radiation or chemotherapy 
examples include treatment of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  pain control or stimulation of blood cell growth 
cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell replication  which requires cells to first replicate their dna 
therefore  many chemotherapeutic agents target the cancer cells ability to replicate dna  or following the replication of their dna  the ability of the cancer cells to divide 
different classes of chemotherapeutic agents are distinguished by their mechanism of action or how they specifically interfere with the cancer cells ability to replicate dna or divide 
when a cancer cell s dna is damaged by a chemotherapeutic agent  dna synthesis is inhibited or cell division is inhibited  and a cellular process known as apoptosis  or programmed cell death  may be activated 
apoptosis of tumor cells can lead to reduction in tumor size or to the arrest of tumor growth 
certain chemotherapeutic agents may act to directly promote apoptosis in tumor cells 
because different chemotherapeutic agents may target different cellular processes required for dna replication and cell division or of apoptosis  chemotherapeutic agents are often used in combination to maximize tumor cell death or inhibition of growth  while more effectively managing the side effect profile of the individual agents 
agents that specifically induce apoptosis or interfere with dna replication or cell division in novel ways are therefore excellent candidates to be used in combination with existing chemotherapy agents 
one of the principal causes of chemotherapy treatment failure is the development of drug resistance by cancer cells  where cancer cells become resistant or refractory to the intended cytotoxic action of a variety of conventional chemotherapeutic agents 
in many cases  resistance developed to a specific chemotherapeutic agent results in multi drug resistance where the cancer cell becomes cross resistant to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents 
given the current limitations of chemotherapy  there is a clear need for new therapies that are effective against a broad range of resistant and refractory cancers  as well as chemotherapeutics that act by novel mechanisms that can offer benefits as a combination therapy with existing chemotherapeutic agents 
standard response criteria are used to report the results of oncology clinical trials 
in solid tumor clinical trials  a complete response means that all measurable tumor tissue has disappeared and the patient appears to be disease free 
a partial response means that measurable tumor tissue has shrunk by at least percent 
stable disease means that the size of the measurable tumor tissue has not shrunk sufficiently to be considered a partial response  but it has not grown more than percent from its smallest size during treatment 
progressive disease means that the tumor has grown by more than percent from its smallest size during treatment 
developed products chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting overview depending on the type of cancer and treatment goals determined by physicians  patients may receive chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen 
one of the most feared side effects of most chemotherapy treatments is chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  or cinv 
in recent years supportive care products to treat the side effects of chemotherapy  such as cinv  have emerged to improve patient comfort and compliance with treatment regimens 
while there are many types of supportive care products for cancer patients  this discussion is focused on the prevention of cinv 
efforts to treat tumors such as those found in breast and lung cancer have led physicians to administer more aggressive chemotherapy regimens 
these cytotoxic agents often cause cinv by triggering release of serotonin from certain cells in the gastrointestinal tract 
the released serotonin stimulates nerve receptors that activate the vomiting center via the chemoreceptor trigger zone 
when  and if  serotonin stimulates the vagal afferents through the ht receptors  vomiting emesis ensues 
although cinv has been managed to a greater degree in recent years  it is estimated that up to percent of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy will experience some degree of emesis if not prevented with an antiemetic 
the severity of emesis is dependent upon the type of chemotherapy administered  the dosing schedule of the chemotherapy  how quickly it was administered  and the patient s age and gender  among other predisposing factors 
if emesis is not properly managed  it can cause dehydration and poor quality of life  eventually leading to interruption or discontinuation of chemotherapy 
most chemotherapy regimens are classified as low or moderately emetogenic and  although the majority of patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy are administered a currently available ht antagonist  there remains a need to improve upon the prevention of acute  within hours of chemotherapy  cinv and  especially  delayed  more than hours after chemotherapy  cinv 
aloxi injection for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection is a potent  highly selective serotonin subtype  or ht  receptor antagonist differentiated by its strong receptor binding affinity and extended half life for the prevention of cinv 
we obtained exclusive us and canadian aloxi injection license and distribution rights from helsinn healthcare sa in april on july   approval was received from the fda to market aloxi injection for the prevention of acute and delayed cinv 
we launched aloxi injection in september through our person oncology focused sales organization 
aloxi injection competes in the growing us us receptor antagonist market estimated to be billion in of this amount  the market for prevention of cinv is estimated to be approximately million 
a primary cause of cinv is the release of serotonin in the body in response to chemotherapy 
ht receptor antagonists  like aloxi injection  act by binding to serotonin receptors in the peripheral and possibly central nervous system involved with nausea and vomiting  thereby blocking serotonin stimulation of these nerves and reducing or eliminating cinv 
cinv can be characterized as acute nausea and vomiting occurring zero to hours post chemotherapy  or delayed nausea and vomiting occurring to hours post chemotherapy 
despite the availability of preventative treatments  including first generation ht receptor antagonists  nearly fifty percent of all patients receiving chemotherapy experience nausea and vomiting 
the results of phase clinical trials demonstrate that aloxi injection is more effective than ondansetron zofran  the current ht receptor antagonist market leader by sales  and dolasetron anzemet  the number two product by sales  for treating cinv due to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy 
the most frequently prescribed chemotherapies  including those used to treat the most common cancers such as breast  lung and colon  are considered moderately emetogenic or having a moderate to moderately high potential to cause nausea and vomiting 
based on the phase trials conducted  aloxi injection is shown statistically to have greater efficacy or to be as effective as ondansetron and dolasetron for prevention of acute and delayed cinv 
overall  the incidence  pattern  duration  and intensity of adverse reactions were similar among patients treated with aloxi injection and other ht receptor antagonists 
in patients treated with aloxi injection during phase trials  the most common adverse reactions related to the study drug were headache  and constipation 
the table below provides a summary of the efficacy results from these pivotal phase clinical trials  where complete response rate is defined as the proportion of treated patients which had no vomiting and no rescue medication 
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy highly emetogenic chemotherapy study study study aloxi ondansetron aloxi dolasetron aloxi ondansetron acute cinv hours delayed cinv hours overall hours indicates results that demonstrate statistically greater efficacy than the alternative ht product compared in ht we believe that aloxi injection will be competitive in the us cinv market for ht receptor antagonists given that aloxi injection is highly selective for the ht receptor and has a thirty to seven hundred times stronger binding affinity for this receptor than currently marketed ht receptor antagonists  is more potent than currently marketed ht receptor antagonists  has demonstrated a plasma elimination half life of almost hours  which is four to ten times longer than any currently marketed ht receptor antagonists  has demonstrated in phase trials to have statistically greater efficacy or to be as effective as ondansetron or dolasetron in preventing both acute and delayed cinv  and is the only ht receptor antagonist approved to prevent both acute and delayed cinv 
the potency and extended half life of aloxi injection may enable patients and their healthcare providers to control both acute and delayed cinv for several days following chemotherapy with a single fixed intravenous dose 
we believe this single fixed dose treatment will be more convenient compared to currently marketed ht 

receptor antagonists  which usually demand patients to adhere to an oral follow up therapy regimen for several days 
salagen tablets for the symptoms of xerostomia and sj gren s syndrome mgi conceived  developed and markets salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride in the united states 
salagen tablets clinically proven efficacy and safety allow it to maintain leadership in the market for treatment of chronic dry mouth symptoms associated with head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation and with sj gren s syndrome patients 
salagen tablets were the first prescription drug approved to treat the symptoms of chronic dry mouth in these patient populations 
chronic dry mouth can be a painful and debilitating condition 
salagen tablets stimulate the exocrine glands  including the salivary glands  to increase their moisture producing activity 
saliva is important to oral health and quality of life in general 
people with chronic dry mouth can experience difficulty eating and sleeping  rapid tooth decay  periodontal disease and oral infections 
sales of salagen tablets in the united states were million in underlying demand for salagen tablets in the united states  as measured by prescription growth  grew at an annual rate of approximately one percent in over head and neck cancer although often effective in treating primary tumors of the head and neck  radiation therapy can permanently damage a patient s salivary glands  resulting in xerostomia  a significant  chronic reduction of saliva production 
patients using salagen tablets for radiation induced dry mouth typically take one tablet three times per day during the course of radiation therapy  which will last approximately six to eight weeks and may then take it indefinitely to treat the residual dry mouth symptoms that follow radiation therapy 
salagen tablets have been shown to stimulate the residual functioning tissue in the damaged salivary glands to increase saliva production and provide patients with a longer lasting solution for the symptoms of radiation induced chronic dry mouth 
in two week trials that were the primary basis for the approval of salagen tablets in  patients who had been treated with radiation therapy for head and neck cancer were assessed for the ability of salagen tablets  versus placebo  to relieve the symptoms of dry mouth and to stimulate saliva production 
in both studies  patients who received salagen tablets experienced significant improvement in their overall condition of dry mouth 
those patients also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in salivary flow compared to the patients receiving placebo tablets 
less than one percent of the patients who received salagen tablets withdrew from these studies due to lack of efficacy 
sweating was the most commonly reported side effect  however  less than one percent of patients taking the approved dosing regimen withdrew from the study due to sweating 
sj gren s syndrome sj gren s syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the body s own immune system attacks the moisture producing glands  including the salivary glands  causing them to lose their ability to produce adequate moisture 
symptoms of sj gren s syndrome vary in degree and type  but the common component is chronic dryness 
patients can exhibit dry mouth  swollen glands  dry eyes  vaginal dryness and fatigue 
the syndrome can be manifested alone primary sj gren s or in combination with other autoimmune disorders secondary sj gren s 
we believe that approximately  of the  sj gren s syndrome patients could benefit from salagen tablets 
in patients with sj gren s syndrome related dry mouth  salagen tablets can help to relieve the symptoms of oral dryness 
salagen tablets can stimulate the salivary glands to increase production of saliva  which is essential to maintaining good oral health 
for sj gren s syndrome patients  previously available therapies included tear and saliva substitutes 
these types of products provide transient relief at best and often fail to prevent complications 
in two week trials that were the primary basis for the supplemental approval of salagen tablets for sj gren s syndrome in  a total of primary or secondary sj gren s syndrome patients were assessed for the ability of salagen tablets  versus placebo  to relieve the symptoms of dry mouth and to stimulate saliva production 
patients receiving salagen tablets four times a day reported a significant improvement in their symptoms associated with oral dryness  and they also demonstrated a significant increase in saliva for the full weeks 
similar to the salagen tablet trials in head and neck cancer patients  less than one percent of the patients receiving salagen tablets withdrew from the trial due to lack of efficacy 
the most common side effect was mild to moderate sweating 
less than four percent of patients taking the approved dosing regimen withdrew from the study due to sweating 
the fda granted us orphan drug status for salagen tablets in as a treatment for the symptoms of xerostomia induced by radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients and in for the symptoms of dry mouth associated with sj gren s syndrome 
our orphan drug protection for salagen tablets for the treatment of symptoms of radiation induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients expired in march and our orphan drug protection for sj gren s syndrome will expire in expiration of our orphan drug protection for salagen tablets may result in competition from manufacturers of generic versions of salagen tablets 
hexalen capsules for ovarian cancer in november  we purchased worldwide rights to hexalen altretamine capsules from medimmune oncology  inc hexalen capsules are an orally administered chemotherapy that is approved as a second line treatment of ovarian cancer 
hexalen capsules are approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in countries including the united states 
sales of hexalen capsules in the united states were million in in the two trials that were the primary basis for its approval in the united states  hexalen capsules were administered as a single agent for or days of a day cycle 
in the patients with measurable or evaluable disease  there were seven complete responses and two partial responses for an overall response rate of percent 
the duration of these responses ranged from two months in a patient with a palpable pelvic mass to months in a patient who achieved a complete response 
in some patients  tumor regression was associated with improvement in symptoms and performance status 
side effects of hexalen capsules are comparable to those seen with other approved chemotherapies and include mild to moderate bone marrow suppression  nausea and vomiting  and peripheral sensations of touch 
a more recent trial in ovarian cancer patients  which was published in gynecologic oncology vol 
pages   investigated the ability of six months of treatment with hexalen capsules to extend survival following achievement of a complete response with front line therapy 
at two years  following completion of front line therapy  patients in this trial demonstrated a higher survival rate compared to that seen in earlier trials

patients undergoing abdominal  gynecological  ear  nose and throat  cardiovascular  and eye surgery are at the highest risk for ponv 
if not prevented  ponv can cause hospital re admissions and increase healthcare costs for patients who undergo surgery 
in the united states  more than million surgical procedures are performed annually  and the incidence of ponv is estimated at to 
if approved for the prevention of ponv  aloxi injection would compete in an approximately million ponv market in the united states 
aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection is a potent  highly selective serotonin subtype  or ht  receptor antagonist differentiated by its strong receptor binding affinity and extended half life and has already been approved for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
we are working with helsinn healthcare  the licensor of palonosetron hydrochloride  to design phase programs with a goal to seek fda approval of aloxi injection for the prevention of ponv and to develop an oral aloxi formulation 
phase trials are expected to begin during for each program 
irofulven for chemotherapy treatment irofulven is our lead cancer therapy product candidate under development and is part of our family of proprietary cancer therapy compounds called acylfulvenes 
acylfulvenes  including irofulven  are semi synthetic derivatives of the natural product illudin s obtained from the omphalotus olearius mushroom 
we licensed rights to the entire class of acylfulvene agents  including irofulven  from the regents of the university of california in irofulven is potentially active as an anti cancer agent in treating a broad range of cancers  has a unique mechanism of action that may make it effective in treating refractory cancers  or cancers that are unresponsive to existing cancer therapies and useful in combination with existing cancer therapies  has demonstrated activity against tumors that are known to be resistant to other cancer therapies  and has a side effect profile that is adequately tolerated 
mechanism of action studies have indicated that irofulven is rapidly taken up by sensitive tumor cell types where it reacts with tumor cell dna and protein targets in a novel manner  producing rapid inhibition of dna synthesis and dna lesions that are difficult for the tumor cell to repair 
the initiation of dna damage by irofulven begins tumor selective apoptosis that ultimately causes cell death 
clinical trials will determine whether the differential effect of irofulven on tumor cells compared to healthy cells translates into important clinical benefit 
we further believe that irofulven could be the first of a series of acylfulvene analogs that merit development as cancer therapies 
we believe irofulven has a unique mechanism of action that makes it well suited for study in refractory patient populations and in combination with other cancer therapies 
preclinical data and early clinical data demonstrate irofulven s activity against tumors that are known to be resistant to other therapies 
preclinical studies have also demonstrated the additive or synergistic effect of irofulven with a number of marketed cancer therapies 
to date  irofulven has demonstrated a side effect profile relative to certain marketed cancer therapies  which we believe enhances the prospect of irofulven combining well with these cancer therapies 
therefore  we believe that pursuing multiple development paths in different refractory cancers and in combination with other cancer therapies is warranted 
preclinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs and initial clinical data from the dosing of over  cancer patients with irofulven have demonstrated that irofulven is adequately tolerated as a chemotherapeutic compound and its side effects are reversible 
the primary dose limiting side effect has been bone marrow suppression  usually observed as decreased blood platelet or white cell counts 
other drug related side effects have been nausea  vomiting  visual disturbances and fatigue 
bone marrow suppression has been controlled through dose adjustments or treatment delays to allow recovery of platelet or white cell counts 
nausea and vomiting are prophylactically controlled with standard  currently available treatments 
visual disturbances and fatigue are managed by dose adjustments and are reversible after discontinuation of treatment 
one method of identifying cancer therapy targets for further human trials is to conduct preclinical tests on mice that have been implanted with human  solid tumors 
testing of irofulven in these disease models has demonstrated dose related anti cancer activity  including an increase in survival or tumor regressions in the following types of cancers prostate gastric ovarian breast pancreatic melanoma non small cell lung small cell lung colon head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma neuroblastoma glioma irofulven single agent trials an investigational new drug application for irofulven was submitted to the fda in september and phase human safety testing was initiated in december phase clinical trials are conducted in small patient populations and are generally not designed to measure efficacy 
in october  we initiated a second phase trial to evaluate the effect of longer infusion times 
both initial phase trials completed enrollment in after establishing a maximum tolerated dose level and a recommended dosing regimen for the initial phase trials 
the investigators participating in our initial phase trials observed anti cancer activity 
seven out of a total of patients who received daily treatments at a dose between and mg m in these trials demonstrated stabilization of disease or tumor shrinkage as a response to irofulven 
in late  we initiated a phase dose optimization trial using intermittent or weekly dosing in patients with malignant solid tumors that were refractory to anti cancer treatment or for which no standard treatment exists 
in this challenging patient population  greatly improved tolerance to acute effects of treatment were observed compared to the five consecutive day dosing schedule used to initiate our phase trials program 
in addition  comparable dose intensity was achieved and evidence of anti cancer activity was observed in this trial 
based on these results and consultation with our panel of outside oncology experts  weekly or bi weekly dosing schedules will generally be used in ongoing and future trials 
we have tested irofulven in a variety of phase solid tumor trials 
we chose to investigate pancreas  ovary  prostate and liver because these cancer types have significant mortality and morbidity associated with them  current therapies are inadequate  there was noticeable anti cancer response in our preclinical studies or clinical trials  clinical trials for pancreas and liver cancers tend to be of a relatively short duration  and product candidates for these indications may qualify for expedited regulatory review 
anti cancer activity of irofulven has been observed in each of these trials  including objective tumor shrinkage 
to obtain marketing approval for irofulven in the united states  pivotal registration trials will need to be successfully completed and submitted to the fda 
phase trials typically use survival as the primary endpoint  compared to a randomly determined control group and have a higher number of enrolled patients than in earlier phases 
irofulven for pancreatic cancer our initial pivotal registration trial of irofulven was for the treatment of refractory pancreatic cancer 
pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer related death in the united states  and is an aggressive disease that has few effective treatment options 
in february  we began a pivotal phase trial of irofulven for treating refractory pancreatic cancer patients 
initiation of this trial was based on phase results in pancreatic cancer patients  improved acute tolerance with every other week dosing of irofulven seen in the dose optimization trial  and discussions with the fda and our panel of outside oncology experts 
the phase trial was a randomized  multi center  international trial in advanced stage pancreatic cancer patients whose disease progressed after treatment with gemcitabine  the current standard of care treatment 
the primary endpoint was overall survival times following treatment with irofulven compared to continuous infusion fluorouracil fu 
two patients were randomized into the irofulven treatment arm for every patient enrolled in the fu control arm 
in april  we stopped enrollment in this phase clinical trial of irofulven for gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer patients 
despite evidence of irofulven activity  preliminary analysis of the phase data by an independent data and safety monitoring board  or dsmb  indicated that the comparator agent fu demonstrated a greater than expected survival benefit  making it statistically improbable that the final study results could achieve our planned objectives for the trial 
for this reason  we will no longer pursue this specific indication for irofulven monotherapy in gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer 
following closure of the trial to enrollment  we continued to make irofulven available to the remaining enrolled pancreatic cancer patients in this trial who had experienced clinical benefit 
irofulven combination trials we believe that an advantage of combination therapy is the potential to achieve enhanced anti cancer benefit with an acceptable side effect profile compared to either agent used alone 
because irofulven has a unique mechanism of action  retains activity against tumors that are known to be resistant to other cancer therapies and in preclinical trials demonstrated additive or synergistic effects in combination with a number of marketed chemotherapies  we are conducting drug combination trials with irofulven 
the first clinical step in exploring combination therapy is to conduct phase  dose ranging trials to determine the maximum tolerated dose of both drugs together 
the anti tumor activity in a completed phase trial of irofulven in combination with irinotecan led to the initiation of a phase trial of irofulven with irinotecan in patients with advanced gastrointestinal tumors 
we are currently conducting four dose ranging trials of irofulven in combination with gemcitabine  capecitabine  docetaxel  and oxaliplatin 
data from these trials and possible follow up phase trials in specific tumor types will be evaluated to determine whether further drug combination development with these marketed therapies is warranted 
irofulven for hormone refractory prostate cancer throughout phase and monotherapy and combination therapy trials  consistent evidence of clinical activity in hormone refractory prostate cancer  or hrpc  has been reported  including activity in patients previously exposed to chemotherapy 
phase data presented at the th annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology asco in indicated that irofulven in combination with prednisone  a steroid  induced decreases of more than percent in prostate specific antigen psa levels in percent of evaluable patients and disease stabilization in percent of patients evaluable for objective tumor response 
psa is a blood marker used by clinicians for treatment decisions 
activity has also been shown in prostate cancer patients treated with irofulven plus the marketed chemotherapies  capecitabine or cisplatin  in phase trials 
following comprehensive analysis of our available data  we are preparing to initiate a phase combination program for irofulven in hrpc patients previously treated with docetaxel 
most hrpc patients in the united states who are receiving chemotherapy are treated with docetaxel  and we believe significant unmet need exists among prostate cancer patients who have failed hormone therapy and who have progressed on docetaxel 
nci clinical trials under a clinical trials agreement  the national cancer institute  or nci  is sponsoring and overseeing  at its own expense  a clinical trials program using irofulven in its network of designated cancer centers and other institutions 
we have agreed to provide drug product for these trials and will have access to any resulting data 
we intend to utilize the results from nci sponsored trials to further characterize the safety of irofulven as well as evaluate the potential of irofulven in additional refractory solid tumor types 
the nci has sponsored trials of irofulven in a range of solid tumor cancers and leukemias and two trials are ongoing 
other acylfulvene analogs in addition to irofulven  we have obtained license rights to acylfulvene analogs 
the synthesis and the initial biological testing of over of these analogs has been performed at the university of california  san diego  or ucsd 
at ucsd  both in vitro and in vivo anti tumor activity has been demonstrated for a significant number of the acylfulvene analogs 
further testing by the nci of some of these analogs has confirmed broad spectrum anti tumor activity 
the broad spectrum anti tumor activity of the acylfulvene analogs suggests that this class of compounds has the potential to produce additional clinical development candidates 
we are currently evaluating these analogs for further preclinical development 
mg and small molecule dna methyltransferase inhibitor programs in august  as part of our strategy to expand our portfolio of marketed and development stage anti cancer products  we entered into an exclusive license  research and development agreement with methylgene inc for north america rights to its proprietary anti cancer product candidate mg and its dna methyltransferase small molecule inhibitor program 
included within our license rights is a united states patent on a method for reversing the tumor causing state of a cell by administering an agent that corrects an aberrant methylation pattern in the dna of the cell 
methylgene is a chemistry driven  rational drug design and development company focused on the inhibition of enzyme targets that are associated with disease 
it pursues two approaches to enzyme inhibition rationally designed mrna inhibitors that block the production of enzymes and rationally designed small molecule inhibitors that block the activity of enzymes 
in a december amendment to the license agreement  methylgene acknowledged full satisfaction of our payment obligations and suspended further payment obligations by us pending a planned june data review of the small molecule inhibitor program and following completion by methylgene of a planned clinical trial with mg if we resume development  our financial responsibilities under the license agreement would also resume 
sales and marketing we currently promote our products in the united states directly to medical oncologists  hematologic oncologists  radiation oncologists  rheumatologists  internal medicine physicians  and other physician specialists using our person oncology focused sales organization 
in  we expanded the sales organization in preparation for the commercial launch of aloxi injection 
our sales organization will continue to be used to promote our current and future oncology products in the united states 
in addition  we have an in house marketing  manufacturing and commercial management staff of persons who support our commercial activities 
we use a variety of marketing programs to reach our targeted audiences  including distribution of product specific brochures in face to face meetings and direct mailings  exhibits at select medical meetings and journal advertising 
our sales and marketing organizations are highly trained and experienced 
we use international collaborations to commercialize our products outside the united states 
we currently have agreements with novartis pharma ag formerly ciba vision ag  kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd 
and pfizer inc to develop and commercialize salagen tablets for the european  japanese and canadian markets  respectively 
under these agreements  we receive payments based on development milestones and or product sales in the pertinent territory 
we also have distribution agreements for salagen tablets in israel  korea  singapore  taiwan  hong kong  colombia  thailand  and malaysia 
we receive payments based upon product sales to these distributors 
research and development we maintain active drug development programs for our new drug candidates and commercialized products 
current drug development efforts are primarily focused on aloxi products and irofulven 
licensing development milestone payments for aloxi products are recognized as research and development expense 
we also participate in post marketing studies to support the continued commercialization of aloxi injection  salagen tablets and hexalen capsules 
we seek product candidate acquisitions in order to expand our development pipeline 
we have incurred significant research and development costs in the past and believe that substantial capital resources will be required to support current and future development programs 
we spent approximately million in  million in  and million in on research and development 
in recent years  to percent of our research and development expense was attributable to contracts with third parties 
approximately percent of our research and development expense in was attributable to third party services  license fees or fda user fees 
funding for research and development is expected to come from internally generated funds  joint ventures  strategic alliances or other sources of capital  including equity or debt offerings 
successful drug development requires a broad spectrum of scientific  clinical and product development expertise 
as part of our strategy  we do not directly conduct basic research or traditional drug discovery activities because we primarily intend to acquire rights to product candidates that are in the human clinical stage of development 
this approach substantially reduces our research risk due to product failure and eliminates the need for direct investment in discovery research laboratories and personnel 
we manage our human clinical development of product candidates by selectively outsourcing certain activities 
we have in house medical communications capabilities and regulatory affairs expertise which allow us to maintain support systems  monitor adverse drug experience reporting  and file new drug applications with the fda 
we outsource other development activities  such as the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials  product formulation and production of clinical supplies 
we expect to continue to contract with third parties until it is necessary and economical to add these capabilities internally 
as of december   we employed persons in research and development  regulatory affairs and product formulation

ben venue laboratories  inc  a unit of boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals  inc  is an approved alternate contract manufacturer of didronel iv infusion 
development stage pharmaceuticals as a regular part of our business  we establish contract manufacturing arrangements for our development stage pharmaceuticals 
these arrangements include purchase orders  supply agreements and development scale manufacturing contracts 
irofulven in april  we entered into a development agreement with abbott laboratories  inc for scale up of the current fermentation process used to produce raw material for the production of irofulven 
the agreement also gives abbott the opportunity to demonstrate its ability to produce the raw material on a commercial scale

patents and proprietary rights we rely on patent rights  orphan drug designation  trade secrets  trademarks  and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products in both the united states and selected foreign jurisdictions 
current patent and orphan drug status with respect to certain of our products is as follows subject status issue date country salagen tablets for symptoms of sj gren s syndrome orphan drug february  united states palonosetron and process for preparation four us patents issued  various patent applications pending april   april   november   and october  united states and various other countries irofulven and use of irofulven  as cancer therapy agent three us patents issued  various patent applications pending august   june   and october  united states and various other countries synthetic methods for preparing acylfulvenes and compounds useful as intermediates for preparing acylfulvenes five us patents issued  various patent applications pending march   january   december   october   and  october  united states and various other countries substituted acylfulvene compounds and use as cancer therapy agents not including irofulven eight us patents issued  various patent applications pending august   august   february   may   november   april   april  and april  united states and various other countries subject status issue date country irofulven for treatment of pancreatic cancer orphan drug april  united states irofulven for treatment of ovarian cancer orphan drug july  united states irofulven for treatment of renal cell carcinoma orphan drug july  united states mg antisense compound for treatment of cancer seven us patents issued  various patent applications pending november   july   july   february   april   may   and february  united states and various other countries small molecule inhibitors of dna methyltransferase for treatment of cancer three patents issued february   april   and july  united states and various other countries the term of a us patent issued from an application filed before june  is the longer of years from its issue date or years from its effective filing date 
the term of a us patent issuing from an application filed on or after june  is years from its effective filing date 
all of the us patents covering irofulven or its use were issued from applications filed before june  the drug price and competition and patent term restoration act of  the generic animal drug act  and the patent term restoration act generally provide that a patent relating to  among other items  a human drug product  may be extended for a period of up to five years by the us commissioner of patents and trademarks if the patented item was subject to regulatory review by the fda before the item was marketed 
under these acts  a product s regulatory review period which consists generally of the period from the time when the exemption to permit clinical investigations becomes effective until the fda grants marketing approval for the product forms the basis for determining the length of the extension an applicant may receive 
there can be no assurance that any issued patents will be extended in term 
we have licensed or obtained patent protection for palonosetron hydrochloride  irofulven and the other acylfulvene analogs 
patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues 
therefore  although we believe our patents are valid  we cannot predict with any precision the scope or enforceability of the claims 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents  that issued patents will provide an adequate measure of protection against competitive technology which could circumvent such patents  or that issued patents would withstand review and be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that infringement of any issued patents cannot be circumvented by others 
orphan drugs are currently provided seven years of marketing exclusivity for an approved indication following approval to market by the fda orphan drug designation for our products does not  however  insulate us from other manufacturers attempting to develop an alternate drug for the designated indication  or the designated drug for another  separate indication 
we also rely on trade secrets and continuing innovation that we seek to protect with reasonable business procedures for maintaining trade secrets  including confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise be known or be independently discovered by competitors 
in addition to the patents which form the basis of the pharmaceutical focus of this company  we also own four us patents which claim maize plants that are resistant to certain herbicides and that also claim methods for producing such resistant plants 
these patents were issued between and while these patents have been licensed to basf originally licensed to american cyanamid  we may still incur expenses associated with any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings related to these patents 
trademarks we have obtained registration of the salagen trademark in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  we have been assigned the hexalen trademark in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  we use the federally registered didronel trademark under a license with procter gamble and we use the aloxi trademark under a license with helsinn healthcare sa 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive  based mostly on product performance and pricing 
many members of the industry have resources far greater than we do  providing them with potentially greater flexibility in developing and marketing their products 
while we will seek to protect our products from direct competition through filing patents  seeking marketing exclusivity under the orphan drug act  and maintaining technical information as trade secrets  there is no way to protect us from competition from products with different chemical composition or products made using different technology 
cevimeline hydrochloride  owned by snow brand pharmaceuticals  inc and marketed by daiichi pharmaceuticals in the united states  was approved in january by the fda as a treatment for dry mouth symptoms associated with sj gren s syndrome 
we cannot estimate what ultimate effect this competing compound will have on the overall size of the sj gren s syndrome market and future demand for salagen tablets  but modest growth in prescription of salagen tablets continued in a product marketed by medimmune  inc  amifostine  was approved in june by the fda for reducing the incidence of radiation induced dry mouth in post operative head and neck cancer patients 
salagen tablets are approved in part for the treatment of dry mouth symptoms resulting from radiation used to treat head and neck cancer patients 
due to the more restricted patient population for amifostine  as well as other factors such as price and invasive administration  we currently believe that amifostine will not have a significant impact on sales of salagen tablets 
we are aware of other products currently under development that may compete with salagen tablets 
the exclusivity period afforded by orphan drug status for salagen tablets as a treatment for symptoms of radiation induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients ended in march competitors could develop and introduce generic drugs comparable to salagen tablets  or drugs or other therapies that address the underlying causes of the symptoms that salagen tablets treat 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our plan to gain product specific protection for each of our pharmaceuticals or that developments by others will not render our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
hexalen capsules are approved in the united states for the treatment of ovarian cancer in patients with persistent or recurrent disease following first line therapy with certain other chemotherapies 
other chemotherapies are also used for second line treatment of ovarian cancer and are marketed by pharmaceutical companies with greater resources than we have 
further  competitors could develop and introduce generic drugs that are comparable to hexalen capsules 
aloxi injection was the fourth ht antagonist approved for marketing in the united states 
the companies that market the other ht antagonists have far greater resources than we have 
further  there is no certainty that the patent protection afforded palonosetron will be effective in keeping generic equivalents from entering the market 
many companies of all sizes  including large pharmaceutical companies as well as specialized biotechnology companies  are developing cancer therapy drugs that will compete with irofulven  if it is approved for sale 
there are also a number of products already on the market that will compete directly with irofulven if it is approved 
in addition  colleges  universities  governmental agencies and other public and private research institutions will continue to conduct research and may develop new cancer therapies which would render our cancer therapy drug candidates obsolete or non competitive 
many of our competitors in the cancer therapy market also have substantially greater financial  research and development  human and other resources than we do 
government regulation our research and marketing activities are subject to significant regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
pharmaceutical products intended for therapeutic use in humans are governed by fda regulations in the united states and by comparable regulations in foreign countries 
the process of completing clinical testing and obtaining fda approval for a new drug product requires a number of years and the expenditure of substantial resources without any assurance that approval for marketing will be granted 
the fda has established mandatory procedures to regulate the manufacturing and testing process regarding the identity  strength  quality and purity of a product 
following initial formulation  the steps required before any new prescription pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  submission of a new drug application  or nda and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale 
preclinical studies are conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain information on the drug s efficacy  mode of action  and to identify any significant safety problems 
the results of these studies are submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
testing in humans may commence days after the ind has been filed unless the fda issues a clinical hold 
additional animal studies may be performed throughout the development process 
a three phase clinical program is usually required for fda approval of a pharmaceutical product  unless accelerated approval is granted 
phase clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety profile  including the safe dosage range  metabolism and pharmacologic action of the product  and  if possible  to gain early evidence on efficacy 
although most phase trials are conducted with healthy volunteers  phase cancer trials are conducted with cancer patients 
following establishment of a safe dose from phase studies  a phase clinical program is conducted for dose ranging and to assess the safety and efficacy of the product in patients with the disease being studied 
phase confirmatory clinical trials are conducted on patients more representative of the intended patient population in terms of medical treatment  age groups  gender and ethnicity 
data from the larger phase program is to provide adequate statistical evidence of safety and efficacy necessary to evaluate the overall benefit and risk relationship in the target patient population 
phase and phase trials are usually multi center trials in order to achieve greater statistical validity and to have data from a broader patient population that is more representative of the intended patient group 
phase  or post approval trials  may be required under accelerated approval or to provide additional data on safety or efficacy of the product 
upon completion of clinical testing  and with data successfully demonstrating that the product is safe and effective for a specific indication  an nda may be filed with the fda 
the nda contains all the scientific evidence including product formulation  manufacturing  control information  preclinical and clinical data 
fda approval of the nda is required before the applicant may market the new product 
even after initial fda approval has been obtained  further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or efficacy for current indications  or to obtain approval for uses other than those for which the product was initially approved 
moreover  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a drug may be marketed 
even if fda approval is obtained  there can be no assurance of commercial success for any product 
post marketing testing may be required  and surveillance programs such as reporting adverse events are required 
the fda may require withdrawal of an approved product from the market if any significant safety issues arise while a product is being marketed 
in addition  before  during and after the process of approval  our prescription drug products must all be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices as set forth by the fda 
marketing of products is also regulated by the fda 
the orphan drug provisions of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act provide incentives to drug and biologics manufacturers to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions  currently defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the us or  for a disease or condition that affects more than  individuals in the us  where the sponsor does not realistically anticipate that revenue generated from sales of the product will exceed the cost of its development 
under these provisions  a manufacturer of a designated orphan product can seek tax benefits  and the holder of the first fda approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for that product for the orphan indication 
while the marketing exclusivity of an orphan drug would deter other sponsors from obtaining approval of the same compound for the same indication  it would not prevent other types of drugs from being approved for the same indication 
the health care industry is changing rapidly as the public  government  medical professionals and the pharmaceutical industry examine ways to broaden medical coverage while controlling health care costs 
potential approaches that may affect us include managed care initiatives  pharmaceutical buying groups  formulary requirements  various proposals to offer an expanded 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of together with rulemaking by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms require a number of changes in medicare practices  including reimbursement 
the changes made to date  are not expected to have an adverse affect on our operations or sales  but we cannot predict the impact  if any of future reimbursement changes 
federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations do not materially affect our operations and we believe that we are currently in material compliance with such applicable laws and regulations

we focus our direct sales efforts solely within the united states and create alliances with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of our products in other countries 
we promote products directly to physician specialists in the united states using our own sales force 
our marketed products include aloxi tm palonosetron hydrochloride injection  salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride  and hexalen altretamine capsules 
given the large market in which aloxi injection competes and its favorable clinical profile  sales of aloxi injection are expected to substantially exceed sales of our other current products 
in the third quarter of  aloxi injection was approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting cinv and we began promoting aloxi injection in september we obtained exclusive us and canadian license and distribution rights to aloxi injection from helsinn healthcare sa helsinn in may in november  we and helsinn expanded the agreement to include rights for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting ponv application of aloxi injection and an oral aloxi formulation 
salagen tablets are approved in the united states for two indications the symptoms of dry mouth associated with radiation treatment in head and neck cancer patients and the symptoms of dry mouth associated with sj gren s syndrome  an autoimmune disease that damages the salivary glands 
sales of salagen tablets in the united states accounted for percent of our product sales during hexalen capsules is an orally administered chemotherapeutic agent approved in the united states for treatment of refractory ovarian cancer patients 
our current product development efforts include preclinical and clinical programs for the acylfulvenes  including irofulven  our novel anti cancer agent with demonstrated activity in a variety of cancers and a unique mechanism of action 
we have also funded development of mg and inhibitors of dna methyltransferase for north american markets 
dna methyltransferase is an enzyme that has been associated with uncontrolled tumor growth 
we provide ongoing clinical support of aloxi injection and salagen tablets 
our research and development expense also includes license fees related to helsinn s now concluded development of aloxi injection for cinv and its ongoing development of aloxi injection for ponv and for an oral aloxi formulation 
in august  we completed a sale of  newly issued shares of common stock in a follow on public offering at per share 
our net proceeds  after fees and expenses  were  since our current operations are expected to begin producing positive cash flow near the end of  these proceeds are primarily intended to fund expansion of our product portfolio 
revenues were million and we anticipate revenues will range between million to million 
the anticipated increase would result from increasing aloxi injection product sales 
net loss for was million and we expect a net loss in of approximately million  given our current product portfolio 
this expectation is exclusive of any increase in net loss that would result from expanding our product portfolio 
results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  our management must make decisions which impact reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  our management applies judgment based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances 
note to the financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following our accounting policy on revenue recognition is fully described in notes and to the financial statements 
the majority of our revenue relates to product sales 
we recognize product sales revenue upon shipment to wholesalers  upon fulfillment of acceptance terms  if any  and when no significant contractual obligations remain 
as is common in the pharmaceutical industry  our domestic sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to the ultimate consumers of our products 
as such  our product sales revenue may be less than or greater than the underlying demand for our products 
we report sales revenue net of wholesaler chargebacks  allowances for product returns  cash discounts  and other rebates 
to determine our estimates for wholesaler chargebacks  product returns and other allowances  we use a combination of historical data and an estimate of future activity 
our estimates are reviewed periodically and are subject to change 
we also recognize revenue related to licensing agreements 
licensing revenue recognition requires management to estimate effective terms of agreements and identify points at which performance is met under the contracts such that the revenue earnings process is complete 
under this policy for out licensing arrangements  revenue related to up front  time based and performance based licensing payments is recognized over the entire contract performance period 
for our major licensing contracts  this results in the deferral of revenue amounts approximately million at december  where non refundable cash payments have been received  but the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the long term nature of the respective agreements 
following our initial estimate of the effective terms of these arrangements  subsequent developments such as contract modifications or terminations could increase or decrease the period over which the deferred revenue is recognized 
research and development expense includes work performed for us by outside vendors and research organizations 
at each reporting period  we estimate expenses incurred but not reported or billed to us by these outside vendors 
these expense estimates typically cover a period of to weeks of expense 
actual results are recorded on a timely basis and  historically  have not been materially different from our estimates 
in addition  costs related to in licensing arrangements for product candidates are expensed as research and development until their first commercial sale 
revenues sales sales revenue decreased percent from  in to  in  but increased percent to  in as is common in the pharmaceutical industry  our domestic sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to the ultimate consumers of our products 
the decrease in sales revenue from to reflects decreased revenue from salagen tablets  resulting from a drawdown of wholesaler inventory amounts  partially offset by an increase in selling price and a continued increase in patient demand 
beginning in the second quarter of  and continuing throughout the rest of  a substantial increase in wholesaler inventory amounts occurred 
a reduction of wholesaler inventories occurred throughout the first half of in the second half of  sales realigned with underlying demand  which grew approximately percent from to  as measured by prescription growth 
the increase in sales revenue from to reflects increased revenue from aloxi injection  salagen tablets and hexalen capsules 
we began the promotion of aloxi injection in september  following its approval by the us food and drug administration 
we recognized million in aloxi injection net sales in  which provided percent of our sales revenue in sales of salagen tablets in the united states provided percent of our sales revenue in  percent in and percent in underlying demand for salagen tablets in the united states  as measured by prescription growth  grew at an annual rate of approximately one percent from to sales of aloxi injection for the first quarter of are expected to be million 
annual sales for aloxi injection are expected to range from million to million and for all other product sales are expected to be approximately million 
licensing licensing revenue decreased four percent from  in to  in  and increased percent to  in we and dainippon pharmaceutical co 
ltd 
terminated our collaborative acylfulvene license agreement in august since we had no future obligations to dainippon after termination  all remaining unamortized licensing revenue related to this relationship was amortized into license revenue in for  we amortized  of deferred revenue into licensing revenue related to previously received non refundable license fees from dainippon  which included  being amortized in the third quarter of licensing revenue is a combination of deferred revenue amortization from licensing arrangements and from royalties that are recognized when the related sales occur 
in  we received a milestone payment of  from novartis ophthalmics ag related to the licensing of salagen tablets in europe 
we recognized   and  of amortized deferred revenue in  and  respectively  related to all payments received under these license agreements 
we will recognize the december  unamortized balance of  from our license agreements into licensing revenue over the expected periods of benefit for the related collaborative arrangements  which is expected to continue into future licensing revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the level of recurring royalty generating activities  and changes in amortization of deferred revenue  including the initiation or termination of licensing arrangements 
we expect licensing revenue for to be approximately million 
costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of sales was percent for  percent for and percent for the increase from to in cost of sales as a percentage of sales is a result of sales of aloxi injection  which launched in september cost of sales may vary from quarter to quarter  depending on the product mix and production costs 
we believe that cost of sales as a percent of product sales for our currently marketed products for will be approximately percent 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent from  in to  in  and increased percent to  in although total costs remained essentially unchanged from to  our costs increased for field selling expense and decreased for direct product promotion and facility expenses 
promotion costs decreased from to due to our initiating promotion of hexalen capsules and mylocel tablets in facility costs decreased from to due to an accrual in for lease obligations for the former office space in excess of estimated sublease income  and physical move costs related to our move to a new office location in the second quarter of costs in also include  in expense related to a reduction in our workforce in the second quarter of the increase from to is primarily a result of increased expenditures for the commercial launch of aloxi injection in september and its continued commercialization 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses for to be approximately million 
research and development research and development expense decreased percent from  in to  in  and increased percent to  in all three periods include expense related to milestone payments under our license agreement for aloxi injection million in  million in and million in exclusive of these license payments  research and development expense decreased percent from  in to  in  and increased percent to  in excluding the license payments for the milestones  the decrease from to represents decreased spending for irofulven 
in april  we stopped our phase trial of irofulven in advanced stage  gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer patients 
we are currently conducting a series of clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of irofulven administered as a single chemotherapy agent or in combination with marketed chemotherapy agents for the treatment of patients with solid tumor cancers who are generally refractory to current therapies 
the decrease in irofulven spending was partially offset by  in expense related to a reduction in our workforce in the second quarter of the increase from to primarily represents clinical trial expenditures for aloxi injection as we assumed responsibility from helsinn for further development of aloxi injection for prevention of cinv following its approval by the fda 
we expect research and development expense for to be approximately million  including expected license fees that will become due upon helsinn s achievement of milestones in the aloxi development programs 
interest income interest income decreased percent from  in to  in  and increased percent to  in the decrease from to is a result of decreases in the investment yields  partially reduced by increases in the average amount of funds available for investment 
the increase from to is a result of increases in the average amount of funds available for investment partially reduced by declining yields 
funds available in increased as a result of the sales of stock in the second and fourth quarters of funds available in additionally increased as a result of the issuance of convertible notes and warrants in the fourth quarter of funds available in increased as a result of the sale of stock in the third quarter 
interest income for will fluctuate depending on the timing of cash flows and changes in interest rates for marketable securities 
interest expense we had no debt in interest expense increased from  in to  in the increase resulted from a full year of interest expense in related to our issuance of convertible debt in the fourth quarter of given the full conversion of the debt on the first quarter of  we expect interest expense related to this convertible debt for to be approximately  of which  will be paid using cash 
the non cash portion of interest expense primarily related to the issuance of warrants in conjunction with the issuance of our convertible debt 
see note to the financial statements our interest expense would increase if we issue new debt securities 
impairment of investment in we recorded a  impairment to our investment in methylgene inc we own an approximate percent  minority interest in methylgene inc  a privately owned canadian biopharmaceutical company 
this minority interest is reported in the financial statements as long term equity investment at the lower of cost or if its value is other than temporarily impaired  then at estimated fair value 
because methylgene is a privately held company the value in this investment is inherently more difficult to estimate than an investment in a public company 
we estimated that the value of the investment declined to  in the year ended december  and an impairment of this asset had occurred that was other than temporary 
tax expense there is no provision for tax expense in  or  due to net losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
our ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon our successful commercialization of aloxi injection  among other things  and therefore  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if and when it is judged to be more likely than not that we will be able to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets  the related valuation allowance will be reduced and a tax benefit will be recorded  and the portion of the allowance pertaining to the exercise of stock options will increase additional paid in capital 
for subsequent tax periods  our tax provision would likely reflect normal statutory tax rates and utilization of our deferred tax attributes would reduce our deferred tax asset balance 
the timing of when this valuation allowance adjustment would occur is primarily dependent upon significant growth in sales of aloxi injection 
it is unlikely that an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would occur in  given current operating expectations 
net loss we had net losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
the increased net loss from to reflects a percent decrease in revenues from to  and a six percent decrease in costs and expenses 
the increased net loss from to reflects a percent increase in revenues from to  and a percent increase in costs and expenses 
during the next several years  we expect to direct our efforts towards activities intended to grow long term revenues  including the continued development and commercialization of aloxi products and continued development of irofulven and other product candidates 
we expect our net loss for to be approximately million exclusive of increases in net loss that would result from expanding our product portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and marketable investments of  and working capital of  compared with  and  respectively  at december  for the year ended december   we received  in cash from the issuance of  shares of common stock in a follow on public offering  and  in cash from issuance of shares under stock award plans 
we used  of cash to fund our operating activities  repaid a  deposit to dainippon as a result of the termination of our license agreement  and purchased  in equipment and furniture 
our investment in inventories increased in by  due to the launch of aloxi 
increased sales of aloxi had accounts receivables increasing by  this was offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  that includes the  helsinn payment due in the first quarter of our cash use in will be very dependent upon the pattern of aloxi injection sales 
we expect the rate of aloxi injection sales to increase during  which will result in increased working capital deployed for aloxi injection finished product inventory and receivables 
however  as sales increase we expect our operations to generate positive cash flow and by the quarter ending december   cash flow from operations could be positive 
we expect annual cash use in to be approximately million  which includes cash needed for operations and is reduced by the receipt in the first quarter of of  upon the exercise of our outstanding stock purchase warrants 
we have sufficient liquidity in our cash and marketable investments to fund these operations 
substantial amounts of capital will be needed to continue executing on our goal of growing our pharmaceutical business 
these capital needs will include funding of continued development and commercialization of our product candidates and marketed products 
we intend to expand our product portfolio through various means such as additional product acquisitions or business combinations 
these transactions will require the use of capital and their timing is difficult to predict 
our capital needs may exceed the capital available from our future operations  collaborative arrangements and existing liquid assets 
for these needs or in anticipation of these needs  we may seek capital from additional equity or debt issuances 
as identified in our risk factors  adverse changes that affect our future demand for our marketed products  continued access to the capital markets  and continued development and expansion of our product candidates would affect our longer term liquidity 
on january  and february   an aggregate of  shares of our common stock were issued to deerfield international limited and deerfield partners  lp pursuant to their election to  first partially and then fully  convert our convertible subordinated notes issued in december for gross proceeds of million 
also on february   the common stock purchase warrants that were issued in connection with that december financing were exercised 
we received  upon the exercise of the warrants and issued  common shares 
payment obligations our future  noncancellable  contractual commitments  are summarized in the following table thereafter lease payments aloxi tm license total we expect to make additional payments to helsinn related to aloxi product candidates totaling million over the course of the next several years upon achievement of certain development milestones 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item selected quarterly operating results the following table shows our unaudited financial information for each of the quarters in the two year period ended december  in our opinion  this unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented  when read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report

cautionary statement this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that may include statements regarding intent  belief or current expectations of our company and our management 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
we desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions 
accordingly  we hereby identify the following important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications  or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by the company s officers and agents 
we do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results 
risks related to our business our business is dependent on the commercial success of aloxi injection 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize aloxi injection we may be unable to continue our operations as planned 
the success of our business is dependent on the successful commercialization of aloxi injection 
aloxi injection is new to the market and may be unfamiliar to members of the medical community 
market acceptance will depend largely on our ability to demonstrate  to the oncology community in particular  the efficacy and safety of aloxi injection as an alternative to currently marketed therapies 
we cannot be certain that aloxi injection will provide benefits considered adequate by providers of oncology services or that enough providers will use the product to ensure its commercial success 
the fda subjects an approved product and its manufacturer to continual regulatory review 
after approval and use in an increasing number of patients  the discovery of previously unknown problems  such as unacceptable toxicities or side effects  with a product may result in restrictions or sanctions on the product or manufacturer that could affect the commercial viability of the product or could require withdrawal of the product from the market 
we must continually submit any labeling  advertising and promotional material to the fda for review 
there is risk that the fda will prohibit use of the marketing material in the form we desire 
unfavorable outcomes resulting from factors such as those identified above could limit sales of aloxi injection or cause sales of aloxi injection to decline 
in those circumstances  our stock price would decline and we may have to find additional sources of funding or scale back or cease operations 
we have a history of net losses 
if we do not have net income in the future  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we are not currently profitable and have a very limited history of profitability 
we expect to incur significant expenses over the next several years as we devote substantial resources to support of the development efforts of aloxi products through milestone payments to helsinn  the continued development of product candidates  including irofulven  and other product candidates and continued commercialization of aloxi injection and our other marketed products 
therefore  we will not generate net income unless we are able to significantly increase revenues from sales of aloxi injection or other products 
furthermore  if we continue to sustain losses  we may be unable to fund development of our product candidates or to continue our business operations as planned 
if we fail to obtain additional capital to grow our business  we will be unable to complete our product portfolio development and expansion plans 
we may need to raise additional funds for various reasons including the following to expand our portfolio of marketed products and product candidates  to develop products we have acquired or may license  to develop irofulven and other acylfulvene analogs  to obtain necessary working capital  and to fund operating losses 
adequate funds for these purposes may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
insufficient funds may cause us to delay  scale back  or abandon some or all of our product acquisition and licensing programs and product development programs 
we may seek additional funding through public and private financing  including equity and debt financing or enter into collaborative arrangements 
any sale of additional convertible debt securities or equity securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders and any debt financing may require us to pledge our assets and enter into restrictive covenants 
entry into collaborative arrangements may require us to give up rights to some of our products or to some potential markets or to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms 
clinical trials are complex and unpredictable and may be difficult to complete or produce unexpected results that could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product under development  including irofulven  we  or helsinn healthcare sa in the case of the aloxi products  must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for use in each target indication 
we depend on collaboration from helsinn healthcare sa  medical institutions and laboratories to conduct our clinical and preclinical testing in compliance with good clinical and laboratory practices as required by the fda 
we  or helsinn healthcare sa  may depend on contract research organizations to manage a substantial portion of the medical institutions utilized to conduct clinical testing 
the results from preclinical animal studies and human clinical trials may not be predictive of the results that will be obtained in large scale testing 
some of the results reported from phase clinical trials are interim results and may not be predictive of future results  including final results from such phase trials  because  among other factors  patient enrollment and the time period for evaluating patient results are not complete 
if we  or helsinn healthcare sa  fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate  the fda would not provide regulatory approval of the product 
the appearance of unacceptable toxicities or side effects during clinical trials could interrupt  limit  delay or abort the development of a product 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after experiencing promising results in previous animal and human studies 
the time required to complete clinical trials is dependent upon  among other factors  the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of clinical protocol requirements  the diversion of patients to other trials or marketed therapies  our ability to recruit and manage clinical centers and associated trials  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  and the patient criteria for the study 
other factors  such as lack of efficacy and unacceptable toxicities  may result in increased costs and delays or termination of clinical trials prior to completion 
in addition  delays in manufacturing of product for our clinical trials could impact our ability to complete our clinical trials as planned 
any failure to meet expectations related to our product candidates could adversely affect our stock price 
since our product candidates such as irofulven may have many potential applications and we have limited resources  our focus on a particular area may result in our failure to capitalize on more profitable areas and may not result in viable products 
we have limited financial and product development resources 
this requires us to focus on product candidates in specific areas and forego opportunities with regard to other product candidates or applications 
for example  our most significant product candidate  irofulven  is in clinical and preclinical trials for a number of applications 
we expect that a substantial portion of our product development efforts over the next several years may be devoted to the further development of irofulven  including its application to the treatment of cancers or sub populations of certain types of cancers with limited therapeutic options such as refractory cancers  for which we believe irofulven could most quickly be developed and approved for marketing 
we are also investigating the efficacy of irofulven in combination with other cancer therapies 
while some of these studies have indicated some effectiveness in relation to the target medical conditions  additional clinical trials must be conducted before product registration may be requested 
if we fail to identify  develop and successfully commercialize applications for irofulven  we may not achieve expectations of our future performance and our stock price may decline 
for example  in april we stopped enrollment in our phase trial of irofulven in advanced stage  gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer patients and our stock price declined significantly 
in addition  we may focus our development of irofulven on a particular application that may result in our failure to capitalize on another application or another product candidate 
our decisions impacting resource allocation may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from more profitable market opportunities 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect our stock price 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  our stock price may decline 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors including the acceptance of  and demand for  aloxi injection  changing demand for our current products  particularly salagen  third parties introducing competing products  the pace and breadth of our development programs  expenditures we incur to acquire  license  develop or promote additional products  availability of product supply from third party manufacturers  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  and the timing of licensing and royalty revenues 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the continuing pattern of losses is primarily a result of spending for research and development and spending for launch activities for aloxi injection exceeding product revenue available from our currently marketed products 
variations in the timing of our future revenue and expense could also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated earnings shortfalls or losses 
sales of salagen tablets have accounted for the majority of our product revenues 
if any factor adversely impacts sales of salagen tablets  our product revenues will decrease 
historically we derived the majority of our product revenues from the sale of salagen tablets 
us sales of salagen tablets represented percent of our total product sales and percent of our total revenue for the year ended december  any factor adversely affecting sales of salagen tablets could cause our product revenues to decrease and our stock price to decline significantly 
in march  our orphan drug status for salagen tablets as a treatment for the symptoms of radiation induced xerostomia  or severe dry mouth  in head and neck cancer patients expired 
our orphan status for salagen as a treatment of symptoms associated with sj gren s syndrome expires in april because salagen tablets does not have patent protection  competing generic products may enter these markets 
in addition  we are aware of two currently marketed products that compete in the same or similar markets as salagen tablets 
if sales of salagen tablets decline as a result of this competition  or for any other reason  our product revenues will decrease and our stock price could decline 
we depend on a single supplier to provide us with the finished drug product for aloxi injection and a single supplier to provide us with the active ingredient for the production of salagen tablets 
if either supplier terminates its relationship with us  or is unable to fill our demand for the ingredients or products  we may be unable to sell those products 
we rely on helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
as our sole and exclusive supplier of the aloxi injection finished drug product 
in addition  we rely on the fine chemicals division of merck kgaa as our sole and exclusive supplier of oral grade pilocarpine hydrochloride  the active ingredient in salagen tablets 
the refined raw material for salagen tablets is a semi synthetic salt of an extract from plants grown and processed exclusively on plantations in south america 
to our knowledge  there is currently no other producer of oral grade pilocarpine hydrochloride that is capable of meeting our commercial needs 
if our relationship with helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
or merck kgaa terminates  or helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
or merck kgaa is unable to meet our needs for any reason  we will need to find an alternative source of the active ingredients and products supplied by those companies 
if we are unable to identify an alternative source  we may be unable to continue offering aloxi injection or producing salagen tablets for commercial sale 
even if we were able to procure adequate supplies of aloxi injection finished drug product or pilocarpine hydrochloride from an alternative source  any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for aloxi injection or salagen tablets for commercial sale  which could cause our product revenues to decrease and our stock price to decline 
if our third party manufacturer of aloxi injection or salagen tablets or any of our other products ceases operations or fails to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations  we may not be able to meet customer demand in a timely manner  if at all 
we do not have manufacturing facilities and we rely on helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
for the production of aloxi injection  patheon inc for the production of salagen tablets  and other third party manufacturers for our other products 
we intend to continue to rely on others to manufacture any future products  including any products that we may acquire or license  and we have no plans to establish manufacturing facilities 
our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver such products 
the manufacture of our products is  and will be  subject to current good manufacturing practices regulations prescribed by the fda or other standards prescribed by the appropriate regulatory agency in the country of use 
there is a risk that our manufacturers  including the current manufacturers of aloxi injection and salagen tablets  will not comply with all applicable regulatory standards  and may not be able to manufacture aloxi injection  salagen tablets  or any other product for commercial sale 
if this occurs  we might not be able to identify another third party manufacturer on terms acceptable to us  or any other terms 
material changes to an approved product  such as manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims  require further fda review and approval 
even after approval is obtained  the fda may withdraw approval if previously unknown problems are discovered 
further  if we  our corporate collaborators or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory or manufacturing process  the fda may impose sanctions  including marketing or manufacturing delays  warning letters  fines  product recalls or seizures  injunctions  refusal of the fda to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications  total or partial suspension of production  civil penalties  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  or criminal prosecutions 
our business strategy depends on our ability to identify  acquire  license and develop product candidates and identify  acquire or license approved products 
as part of our business strategy we plan to identify  acquire  license and develop product candidates and identify  acquire and license approved products for markets that we can reach through our marketing and distribution channels 
if we fail to obtain  develop and successfully commercialize additional products  we may not achieve expectations of our future performance and our stock price could decline 
because we do not directly engage in basic research or drug discovery  we must rely upon third parties to sell or license product opportunities to us 
other companies  including some with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  are competing with us to acquire or license such products or product candidates 
we may not be able to acquire or license rights to additional products or product candidates on acceptable terms  if at all 
furthermore  we may not be able to successfully develop any product candidates we acquire or license 
in addition  we may acquire or license new products with different marketing strategies  distribution channels and bases of competition than those of our current products 
therefore  we may not be able to compete favorably in those product categories 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with third party collaborators or enter into new relationships  we may not be able to develop any of our product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner  if at all 
our continued success will depend in large part upon the efforts of third parties 
for the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of our products  we currently have  and will likely continue to enter into  various arrangements with other corporations  licensors  licensees  outside researchers  consultants and others 
however  we cannot be certain of the actions these parties will take  and there is a risk that we will be unable to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements to develop or commercialize our products  any arrangements with third parties will not be successful  third party collaborators will not fulfill their obligations to us under any arrangements entered into with them  strategic collaborators  including helsinn healthcare sa  will terminate their relationship with us  or current or potential collaborators will pursue treatments for other diseases or seek alternative means of developing treatments for the diseases targeted by our programs or products 
our third party collaborators include public research institutions  research organizations  teaching and research hospitals  community based clinics  testing laboratories  contract product formulation organizations  contract packaging and distribution companies  manufacturers  suppliers and license collaborators 
we consider our arrangements with helsinn healthcare sa  patheon inc  and merck kgaa to be significant 
if any of our collaborators breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or otherwise fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  we may experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of the products or product candidates or the research program covered by the agreement and we may need to devote additional funds or other resources to these activities 
if we are unable to enter into new or alternative arrangements to continue research and development activities  or are unable to continue these activities on our own  we may have to terminate the development program 
as a consequence  we may experience a loss of future commercial product potential and a decline in our stock price 
we have licensed the right to promote  sell and distribute aloxi products in the united states and canada from a third party 
we are particularly dependent on that third party for our ability to commercialize aloxi products 
we have entered a license agreement with helsinn healthcare sa under which we have acquired a license to sell and distribute aloxi products in the united states and canada through december  furthermore  under the terms of our license  we are required to purchase all of our aloxi products from helsinn healthcare sa 
the license agreement may be terminated for specified reasons  including if the other party is in substantial or persistent breach of the agreement  if we have experienced a change of control and the acquiring entity has competing products or our marketing and sales related commitments to the licensor are not maintained by the acquiring entity  or if either party has declared bankruptcy 
although we are not currently in breach of the license  and we believe that helsinn healthcare sa is not currently in breach of the license  there is a risk that either party could breach the license in the future 
in addition  if we were to breach the supply agreement with helsinn birex pharmaceutical ltd 
contemplated by the license  helsinn healthcare sa would be permitted to terminate the license 
if the license agreement were terminated  we would lose all of our rights to sell and distribute aloxi products  as well as all of the related intellectual property and all regulatory approvals 
in addition  helsinn healthcare sa holds the rights to palonosetron the active ingredient in aloxi products through an agreement with syntex usa inc and f 
hoffmann la roche ag 
we cannot be certain of the actions that these parties will take  and there is a risk that these third parties will end their relationship  which would leave us without rights to the pharmaceutical preparations  products and know how required to produce aloxi products 
as a consequence of such a termination  we would lose all of our rights to sell and distribute aloxi products  which would harm our business and could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
we rely on multinational and foreign pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates in markets outside the united states 
with respect to products in which we own rights outside the united states  our strategy for commercialization of such products in markets outside the united states is to enter into development and marketing alliances with multinational and foreign pharmaceutical companies 
we have entered into alliances with various companies related to the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates in markets outside the united states 
our continued relationships with strategic collaborators are dependent in part on the successful achievement of development milestones 
if we or our collaborators do not achieve these milestones  or we are unable to enter into agreements with our collaborators to modify their terms  these agreements could terminate  which could cause a loss of licensing revenue  a loss of future commercial product potential and a decline in our stock price 
we recognize licensing revenue from our marketing collaborators as a portion of our total revenue 
future licensing revenues from these collaborators will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the achievement of milestones by us or our collaborators  the amount of product sales and royalty generating activities  the timing of initiating additional licensing relationships  and our continuing obligation related to license payments 
if we fail to compete successfully with our competitors  our product revenues could decrease and our stock price could decline 
competition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense 
most of our competitors are large  multinational pharmaceutical companies that have considerably greater financial  sales  marketing and technical resources than we do 
most of our present and potential competitors also have dedicated research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that compete with our products 
currently  aloxi injection competes with three other products from the ht receptor antagonist class of compounds  as well as products from other chemical classes that are also used for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
most of these products are marketed by large  multinational competitors  including glaxosmithkline  roche and aventis 
if aloxi injection does not compete successfully with existing products on the market  our stock price could decline significantly 
additionally  medimmune  inc and daichi pharmaceutical have drugs that are approved for sale and compete in the same markets as salagen tablets 
other pharmaceutical companies are developing products  which  if approved by the fda  will compete directly with aloxi injection or salagen tablets 
our competitors could also develop and introduce generic drugs comparable to aloxi injection or salagen tablets  or drugs or other therapies that address the underlying causes of the symptoms that aloxi injection or salagen tablets treat 
if a product developed by a competitor is more effective than our product  or priced lower than our product  then our product revenue could decrease and our stock price could decline 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
if we are not able to attract and retain key employees and consultants  our product development  marketing and commercialization plans could be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the members of our scientific and management staff 
if we are not able to retain any of these persons  our product development  marketing and commercialization plans may suffer and our stock price could decline 
none of our executive officers has an employment agreement with us 
if we are unable to retain our scientific and management staff  we will need to hire additional qualified personnel for us to pursue our product acquisition  development  marketing and commercialization plans 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms  given the competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel  our product acquisition  development  marketing and commercialization plans will suffer and our stock price could decline 
if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological changes in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  we may be unable to continue our operations 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have experienced rapid and significant technological change 
we expect that pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology will continue to develop rapidly 
our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to develop and maintain technology that is competitive 
if other companies achieve technological advances with their products or obtain fda approval before we are able to obtain such approval  our products may become obsolete before they are marketed or before we recover any of our development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
in addition  alternative therapies or new medical treatments could alter existing treatment regimens  and thereby reduce the need for one or more of our products  which could result in the termination of the development in one or more of our product candidates  or in the decline in sales of one of our approved products  which could cause our stock price to decline 
risks related to our industry if we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates  or if regulatory approval is delayed for any reason  we will be unable to commercialize and sell our products as we expect 
prior to marketing  each of our product candidates must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process conducted by the fda in the united states and by comparable agencies in other countries 
the product development and approval process can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
there is risk that the fda or a foreign regulatory authority will not approve in a timely manner  if at all  any product we develop 
generally  the fda approves for sale only a very small percentage of newly discovered pharmaceutical compounds that enter preclinical development 
we may encounter delays or denials in regulatory approvals due to changes in fda policy during the period of development  or changes in the requirements for regulatory review of each submitted new drug application  or nda 
there is also risk that regulatory authorities in the united states and elsewhere may not allow us to conduct planned additional clinical testing of any of our product candidates  including irofulven or aloxi products  or that  if permitted  this additional clinical testing will not prove that these product candidates are safe and effective to the extent necessary to permit us to obtain marketing approvals from regulatory authorities 
except for those products already approved  none of our product candidates are currently being tested in phase or registration clinical trials 
we cannot apply for a regulatory approval to market a product candidate until we successfully complete phase or registration clinical trials for that product 
if we are unable to obtain intellectual property protection  or protect our proprietary technology  we may be unable to compete effectively 
the fda awarded us orphan drug status for salagen tablets in as a treatment for the symptoms of xerostomia  or severe dry mouth  induced by radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients and in for the symptoms of dry mouth associated with sj gren s syndrome 
an orphan drug designation entitles us to marketing exclusivity of the protected drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years 
our orphan drug protection for salagen tablets expired in march for the treatment of symptoms of radiation induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients and will expire in for the sj gren s syndrome indication 
upon expiration of any of our orphan drug protection for salagen tablets  we may face competition from manufacturers of generic versions of salagen tablets 
we hold an exclusive united states and canada license on patents covering aloxi injection proprietary rights 
in addition  we hold an exclusive  worldwide license on patents and patent applications covering acylfulvene proprietary rights  including irofulven 
the license applicable to these technologies is subject to certain statutory rights held by the us government 
even though we have licensed these patents  we may not have exclusive rights to all possible acylfulvene analogs  all possible methods of using acylfulvene analogs to treat tumors or all possible synthetic methods for preparing acylfulvenes 
in addition  we licensed rights to patents and patent applications covering mg and inhibitors of dna methyltransferase 
protection of these rights and creation of additional rights involve joint responsibilities between us and the respective license party 
our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future  or those we license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  other entities may develop similar technologies that fall outside the scope of our patents 
thus  any patent rights that we own or license from third parties may not provide sufficient protection against potential competitors 
in the event that our technologies or methods used in the course of developing or selling our products infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of third parties  we and our corporate collaborators may be prevented from pursuing product development or commercialization 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees and consultants 
there is a risk that these confidentiality agreements will be breached  we will not have adequate remedies for any breach of these agreements  our trade secrets will otherwise become known  or our trade secrets will be independently discovered and used by competitors 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been characterized by litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be diverted 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using the technology or to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms  if at all  or to cease manufacturing and selling our products 
this could cause us to terminate the development of one or more of our product candidates  to discontinue marketing an existing product  or to pay royalties to a third party 
any of these events could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
if the use of one of our products harms people  we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our product is alleged to have harmed someone 
although we have taken  and continue to take  what we believe are appropriate precautions  there is a risk that we will not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and in the aggregate for the year 
there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to cover claims 
there is also a risk that adequate insurance coverage will not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the successful assertion of an uninsured product liability or other claim against us could cause us to incur a significant expense to pay such a claim  could adversely affect our product development and could cause a decline in our product revenue and the price of our stock 
in addition to product liability risks associated with sales of our products  we may be liable to the claims of individuals who participate in clinical trials of our products 
a number of patients who participate in trials are already critically ill when they enter a trial 
the waivers we obtain may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability or the costs of product liability litigation 
our product liability insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 
as a result of these factors  a product liability claim  even if successfully defended  could cause us to incur a significant expense to defend such a claim  could adversely affect our product development and could cause a decline in our product revenue and the price of our stock 
we could become the subject of legal proceedings or investigations that could result in substantial fines  penalties  injunctive or administrative penalties and criminal charges  which would increase our expenses and redirect management s attention away from business operations 
our business operations are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations 
other pharmaceutical companies have been the subjects of legal proceedings or investigations related to pricing  marketing  promotional and clinical trial practices 
if we become the subject of legal proceedings or investigations  our expenses would increase and commercialization of our products could be adversely affected 
further  management s attention would be diverted from our business operations 
if we issue a product recall  we may not sell as much of our products in the future and we may incur significant expenses 
the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for product sales may request product recalls or we may issue product recalls 
these product recalls may occur due to manufacturing issues  safety concerns or other reasons 
we do not carry any insurance to cover the risk of a product recall 
any product recall could have a material adverse effect on our product revenue and could cause the price of our stock to decline 
if we or patients using our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  our product sales and price of our stock could decline 
there is much uncertainty about the reimbursement status of healthcare products 
our profitability will depend in part on the price we are able to charge for our products  and the availability of adequate reimbursement for our products from third party payors  such as government entities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
federal and state regulations govern or influence the reimbursement status of healthcare products in many situations and third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of together with rulemaking by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms require a number of changes in medicare practices  including reimbursement 
the changes made to date  are not expected to have an adverse affect on our operations  sales or the price of our stock  but we cannot predict the impact  if any of future reimbursement changes 
salagen tablets generally have been eligible for reimbursement from third party payors and we have applied for  or in certain cases already received confirmation of  reimbursement eligibility for aloxi injection 
although third party reimbursement previously has not been an issue for us  it becomes important to the commercialization of aloxi products 
reimbursement of newly approved health products is uncertain 
there is a risk that reimbursement will not be available for aloxi products or for our future products 
if government entities and other third party payors do not provide adequate reimbursement levels for our products  our product and license revenues would be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
in recent years  various parties have proposed a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing national healthcare systems 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control of pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals 
cost controls  if mandated by a government agency  could decrease the price that we receive for our current or future products 
these proposals  if enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our product and license revenues and could cause our stock price to decline 
in certain countries  regulatory authorities must also approve the sales price of a product after they grant marketing approval 
there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain satisfactory prices in foreign markets even if we obtain marketing approval from foreign regulatory authorities 
our operations  and the operations of our third party contractors  involve hazardous materials that could expose us to liability if environmental damage occurs 
our operations  and the operations of our third party contractors involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  third parties may hold us liable for any resulting damages  which may exceed our financial resources and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations 
risks related to our common stock our stock price is volatile  which may result in significant losses to shareholders 
there has been significant volatility in the market prices of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies securities 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  and some of these factors are beyond our control 
these factors include fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or acquisitions or licensing of therapeutic products or product candidates by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  positive or negative progress with our clinical trials  governmental regulation  including healthcare reimbursement policies  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  developments in our relationship with collaborators and suppliers  and announcements of new strategic collaborations  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of our products  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these factors  including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock into the market 
our stock price ranged from to per share during the two year period ended december  broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following large falls in the price of a company s shares  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
any adverse determination in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities 
we have outstanding options that have the potential to dilute shareholder value and cause our stock value to decline 
we frequently grant stock options to our employees and other individuals 
at december   we had options outstanding for  shares of our common stock at option prices ranging from to 
if some or all of such shares are sold into the public market over a short time period  the value of our stock is likely to decline  as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at the prevailing market prices 
such sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future on terms that we deem acceptable 
our charter documents  our shareholder rights plan and minnesota law contain provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
our charter documents contain provisions that may discourage third parties from seeking to acquire our company 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations  and the authority of the board of directors to issue  without shareholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan  or poison pill  which enables our board of directors to issue preferred stock purchase rights that would be triggered by an acquisition of percent or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
these provisions and specific provisions of minnesota law relating to business combinations with interested shareholders may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a merger or change in control 
some of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of our company even if shareholders would receive an attractive value for their shares or if a significant number of our shareholders believed such a proposed transaction to be in their best interests 
as a result  shareholders who desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are not subject to risks of material foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our investment practices 
we place our marketable investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
we do not expect material losses with respect to our investment portfolio or exposure to market risks associated with interest rates 
the impact on our net loss as a result of a one percentage point change in short term interest rates would be approximately  based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable investment balances at december
