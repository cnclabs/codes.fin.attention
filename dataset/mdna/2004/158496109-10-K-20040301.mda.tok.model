item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading producer of manufactured housing in the us as of january   we operated homebuilding facilities in states and two provinces in western canada 
at january   our manufactured homes were sold through company owned sales centers in states  through approximately  independent sales centers across the us and western canada and directly to builders and developers 
approximately of the independent retailer locations were members of our champion home centers chc retail distribution network 
during  our sales and operating results continued to be affected by challenging industry conditions including limited availability of consumer financing and floor plan inventory financing  high levels of homes repossessed from consumers and an uncertain economic outlook 
industry retail sales and wholesale shipments of new homes declined as a result of reduced levels of available financing and the high number of repossessed homes that were in the market 
we estimate that approximately  repossessed homes were resold in compared to approximately  homes in both and according to data reported by ibts  us industry wholesale shipments of hud code homes and floors decreased and  respectively  from levels after declining and  respectively  in from levels 
in the fourth quarter of  the industry experienced a decline in year over year wholesale shipments of hud code homes  based on data reported by the ibts 
in response to these industry conditions and their effect on our sales volume and operating results  during we closed seven  or  of our manufacturing facilities and  or  of our retail sales centers operated at the beginning of the year 
in connection with the closing and consolidation of our manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers  we recorded pretax restructuring charges totaling million and impairment charges of million for retail goodwill 
see restructuring charges and goodwill impairment charges below for additional discussion 
since the industry downturn began in mid  we have closed and consolidated manufacturing facilities 
since mid we have closed retail sales locations to eliminate under performing operations and rationalize our operations and capacity for industry conditions 
in addition to the restructuring actions mentioned above  the following occurred in we finalized a million secured revolving credit facility and replaced cash collateralized letters of credit and surety bonds with letters of credit issued under the facility which resulted in the release to us of million of cash collateral 
we purchased and retired million of our senior notes in exchange for cash payments totaling million and payments of our common stock totaling million shares  resulting in a net pretax gain of million 
we received income tax refunds totaling million primarily from the filing of our federal tax return 
we exited the consumer finance business and liquidated substantially all the consumer loans that had been originated 
the total loss from discontinued operations was million in see liquidity and capital resources  income taxes and discontinued operations below for additional discussion 
the number of manufactured homes that are sold to consumers and related wholesale demand are significantly affected by the availability  credit underwriting standards  terms and cost of consumer financing 
two basic types of consumer financing are available home only or personal property loans for purchasers of only the home  and real estate mortgages for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed 
during the past five years a number of consumer lenders have exited the market 
the remaining lenders have  in many cases  tightened credit underwriting standards and loan terms and increased interest rates for manufactured home loans  which have reduced lending volumes 
real estate mortgage lenders tightened terms or discontinued financing for manufactured housing as a result  in part  of program changes by traditional buyers of conforming mortgage loans  primarily fannie mae and freddie mac 
independent retailers of our manufactured homes generally finance their inventory purchases with floor plan financing provided by lending institutions 
the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits affect the availability of wholesale financing to retailers 
during the past five years  several major national floor plan 
table of contents lenders have exited the industry or curtailed their lending volumes 
the remaining floor plan lenders or new floor plan lenders entering the industry have changed the terms of their loans as compared to previously available terms for floor plan financing 
the industry s us manufacturing shipments and retail sales of new homes in are expected to suffer from the factors described above 
we expect our manufacturing and retail sales volumes and margins to be affected until competitively priced consumer financing is more readily available  consumer repossession levels decline and retail sales of new homes increase 
we are focusing on matching our manufacturing capacity and number of company owned retail sales centers to industry conditions  improving or eliminating under performing manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers  improving independent and company owned retailer inventory turnover  rewarding independent retailers for retail selling of homes purchased from our manufacturers and promoting sound business practices at our independent retailers 
we are seeking additional sources of consumer lending for our retailers 
we also seek to expand our manufacturers distribution network 
we continually review our manufacturing capacity and the number and locations of company owned retail sales centers and will make further adjustments as deemed necessary

goodwill impairment charges impairment charges in in the third quarter of  as a result of the significant downsizing of our operations in reaction to ongoing reductions in industry sales and in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a test for retail and manufacturing goodwill impairment using the income approach 
under this method  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is 
table of contents expected to generate over its remaining life 
in applying this present value method  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 
in applying the income approach  we assumed a cash flow period of five years  a discount rate of and a terminal value of five times the present value of the fifth year s estimated future cash flows 
the results of this impairment test indicated that retail goodwill had no value  resulting in a non cash  pretax impairment charge equal to the remaining balance of retail goodwill of million  which was recorded in the quarter ended september  impairment charges in in the second quarter of  as a result of the closure of retail sales centers  we performed a test for goodwill impairment similar to that described above 
the results of this impairment test indicated that the implied fair value of the retail goodwill was less than its carrying value  resulting in a non cash  pretax impairment charge of million 
we performed our transitional test for goodwill impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
as of the beginning of and concluded no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill existed at that date 
restructuring charges during  our sales and operating results continued to be affected by the challenging industry conditions described above

income taxes we incurred significant pretax losses in  and  and the challenging industry conditions resulted in providing a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in deferred tax assets will continue to require a valuation allowance until we have demonstrated their realizability through sustained profitability and or from other factors 
current federal income tax regulations provide for a two year carryback of net operating losses 
we have no taxable income available during this carryback period  and as a result  our net operating loss in results in a tax loss carryforward that will be available to offset future taxable income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended january  differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of this valuation allowance for deferred taxes which offsets any deferred tax benefits resulting from tax loss carryforwards in the period 
the income tax benefit was comprised primarily of the us federal benefit discussed below  partially offset by federal and provincial taxes on canadian income

table of contents goodwill impairment charges in the second quarter of  as a result of the significant downsizing of our retail operations in reaction to continuing challenging industry conditions and in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a test for goodwill impairment using the income approach 
the results of this impairment test indicated that the implied fair value of the retail goodwill was less than its carrying value  resulting in an impairment charge of million  which was recorded in the quarter ended june  contingent repurchase obligations we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to our independent retailers 
upon default by a retailer under a floor plan financing agreement with an associated repurchase agreement  the repurchase agreement generally requires the manufacturer to repurchase the loan or the home for the unpaid balance of the floor plan loan  subject to certain adjustments 
in the event of such repurchases  our loss is equal to the difference between the repurchase price and the net resale price to another retailer 
in the fourth quarter of  we changed a majority of our volume rebate programs to provide for payment of the rebate after sale of the home by the retailer to a consumer  at which time the company has no further repurchase exposure for the home 
currently  in the event we are requested to repurchase homes upon retailer defaults  we are able to offset a portion of the loss with the related accrued rebates which will not be paid 
our policy of paying rebates upon retail sale of the home promotes prudent inventory and floor plan management by retailers and has resulted in a reduced number of defaults and reduced severity of losses upon repurchase 
we use information provided by the primary national floor plan lenders to estimate our contingent repurchase obligations 
with the exit of certain national floor plan lenders from the industry and the shift to alternative retail inventory financing sources  this estimate of our contingent repurchase obligation may not be precise 
each quarter we review our contingent wholesale repurchase obligations to assess the adequacy of the reserve for repurchase losses 
this analysis is based on the combination of current and historical experience  reports received from three of the primary national floor plan lenders that provide approximately of all floor plan financing for our independent retailers  and information regarding our retailers obtained from our manufacturing facilities 
the estimated repurchase obligation is calculated as the total amount that would be paid upon the default of all of our independent retailers whose inventories are subject to repurchase agreements  without reduction for the resale value of the repurchased homes 
potential losses under repurchase obligations are determined by the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net resale value of the homes  less accrued rebates 
each month we use the information from the industry s three primary floor plan lenders to determine the amount subject to repurchase and the estimated potential loss thereunder 
as of january   our largest independent retailer  a nationwide retailer  had approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase for up to months from date of invoice 
as of january  our next largest independent retailers had an aggregate of approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase for up to months from date of invoice  with individual amounts ranging from approximately million to million per retailer 
a summary of actual repurchase activity for the last three years follows dollars in millions estimated repurchase obligation at end of year number of retailers defaults number of homes repurchased total repurchase price losses incurred on homes repurchased 
table of contents our estimated contingent repurchase obligation has declined during the industry downturn due to reduced sales and inventory at our independent retailers and due to an estimated of independent retailer inventory not being financed with the primary national floor plan lenders 
we do not always enter into repurchase agreements with these alternative floor plan lenders 
during the first quarter of  wholesale repurchase reserves were increased million in connection with the extension of repurchase terms to months for certain national floor plan lenders and for the negative effects of market conditions on our largest independent retailer 
during  we agreed to extend both repurchase terms and the timing of required principal curtailment payments by this independent retailer to respective floor plan lenders 
liquidity and capital resources unrestricted cash balances totaled million at january   up from million at december  during  net cash of million was provided by continuing operations  principally from federal income tax refunds 
in addition  cash of million was provided by decreases in restricted cash balances  million was provided by discontinued operations and million was provided by proceeds from the sale of five closed manufacturing facilities  a retail sales center and one development operation

we sold consumer finance loans from our discontinued operations with a face value of approximately million for approximately million at which time warehouse line borrowings were reduced by million 
we received net proceeds of million after the warehouse line pay down and payment of certain expenses 
we amended and renewed the warehouse facility that supported our finance company s operations 
this facility was paid off and terminated in the third quarter of as a result of our decision to exit the consumer finance business 
we received tax refunds totaling million  primarily from the filing of our federal tax return and the carryback of the net operating loss 
in january  we finalized a committed three year  million revolving credit facility for letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
availability under this credit facility is limited to a borrowing base  and is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment  cash and other assets 
the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us  only in the event that liquidity  as defined  falls below million  to maintain certain levels of earnings  as defined  and maintain certain ratios of earnings to fixed charges  as defined 
in addition  other restrictions such as the ability to make certain investments  pay dividends and purchase or redeem our common stock would go into effect 
the facility also contains covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens  and sell assets 
liquidity  as defined  consists of the majority of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus unused availability under the facility 
earnings  as defined  consist of net income or loss excluding interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  non cash 
table of contents restructuring costs and gains from extinguishment of senior notes 
fixed charges  as defined  consist primarily of interest expense  capital expenditures  dividends paid in cash  required principal payments of debt and lease payments paid or accrued during the calculation period and cash losses under wholesale repurchase obligations 
the financial covenants that are required in the event that our liquidity falls below million are required minimum earnings of million and required minimum ratio of earnings to fixed charges of to for each month period ending on a fiscal quarter end  including our fiscal year end 
for the year ended january   our earnings  as defined  were negative million and our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was negative to at january  our liquidity  as defined  was million  which was in excess of million such that these financial covenants were not in effect 
we expect  over the next months  to maintain liquidity at or in excess of the million threshold 
thus  while our operating results may continue to be below the required levels of earnings and ratios of earnings to fixed charges  these covenant requirements are not expected to be in effect 
as of january   facility availability was million which was entirely used for letters of credit 
no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
we expect to continue to utilize availability under this facility principally for letters of credit 
upon completion of our million credit facility  substantially all of the fully cash collateralized letters of credit were terminated  resulting in the release to the company of restricted cash of million that had been held as collateral 
additionally  million of cash deposits were released to the company upon replacing cash collateral for surety bonds with letters of credit under the new credit facility 
our two issuances of senior notes have at times traded at discounts to their respective face values 
we continuously evaluate the most efficient use of our capital  including without limitation  purchasing  refinancing or otherwise retiring our outstanding indebtedness  debt exchanges  restructuring of obligations  financings  and issuances of securities  whether in the open market or by other means and to the extent permitted by our financing arrangements 
we will evaluate any such transactions in light of then existing market conditions 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
the debt incurrence covenant in the indenture governing the senior notes due currently limits additional debt to i a working capital line of credit up to a borrowing base equal to of otherwise unencumbered inventories and of otherwise unencumbered accounts receivable  ii warehouse financing meeting certain parameters up to million  iii other debt up to million  and iv ordinary course indebtedness and contingent obligations that includes non speculative hedging obligations  floor plan financing  letters of credit  surety bonds  bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements related to retailer floor plan financing and guarantees of additional debt otherwise permitted to be incurred 
the resulting effect at january   when combined with limits in our senior notes due  was a working capital line of credit limit of approximately million of which no more than approximately million of cash borrowings could be secured debt 
as of january   secured debt under this covenant was million 
in april  we completed an amendment and renewal of the million warehouse facility that expired in april at a reduced size of million 
the warehouse facility was maintained for a consolidated third party special purpose entity to support our consumer finance operations 
as discussed in discontinued operations  during the third quarter we exited the consumer finance business 
as a result  the warehouse facility was paid off and terminated 
we have two floor plan facilities with total availability of million  of which million was outstanding at january  one of these facilities for million contains a covenant requiring the maintenance of million of liquidity  as defined in the revolving credit facility  at each fiscal month end 
if we were to be out of compliance with this covenant  the lender could terminate the credit line and cause the debt to become immediately due and payable 
as of january   we had approximately million outstanding under this facility and were in compliance with the covenant 

table of contents we expect to spend less than million in on capital expenditures 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near term 
contingent liabilities and obligations we had significant contingent liabilities and obligations at january   including estimated wholesale repurchase obligations totaling approximately million without reduction for the resale value of the homes  surety bonds and letters of credit totaling million and guarantees by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries of million of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
these guarantees are several or joint and several and are related to indebtedness of certain manufactured housing community developments which are collateralized by the properties being developed 
we have provided various representations  warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of our business  in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements 
we are also subject to various legal proceedings and claims  which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent liabilities and obligations will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
summary of liquidity and capital resources at january   our unrestricted cash balances totaled million and we had unused availability of million under our two floor plan facilities and no unused availability under our million credit facility 
therefore  total cash available from these sources was approximately million 
in  continuing operating activities used cash of million  excluding income tax refunds totaling million  and cash used for capital expenditures was million 
currently  we expect that cash flow from operating activities and cash used for capital expenditures for each of the next two years will not differ materially from cash flow in  excluding income tax refunds 
in addition  we have less than million of scheduled debt payments due in and therefore  the level of cash availability is projected to be substantially in excess of cash needed to operate our businesses for the next two years 
in the event one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would revise our operating strategies accordingly 
contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of payments due by period for our contractual obligations for long term debt  capital leases  operating leases and certain other long term liabilities as of january  period after january  within after total year to years to years years in thousands long term debt senior notes obligations under industrial revenue bonds other capital leases and debt operating leases deferred purchase price obligation the deferred purchase price obligation is payable in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
table of contents and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax assets  and property  plant and equipment 
historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves  including reserves for self insured risks  warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses 
following is a description of each accounting policy requiring significant judgments and estimates reserves for self insured risks we are self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation  general and products liability  auto liability  health and property insurance 
under our current self insurance programs  we are generally responsible for up to  per claim for workers compensation  per claim in california and automobile liability claims  up to million per claim for product liability and general liability claims and up to million per claim for property insurance claims including business interruption losses 
we maintain excess liability and property insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
under our current self insurance program we are responsible for of health insurance claims 
estimated insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors considered in estimating our insurance reserves are the nature of outstanding claims including the severity of the claims  estimated costs to settle existing claims  loss history and inflation  as well as estimates provided by our outside insurance broker and carrier  and third party actuaries 
significant changes in the factors described above could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
warranty reserves our manufacturing operations provide the retail homebuyer with a twelve month warranty 
estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale 
our warranty reserve is based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing operations as of the balance sheet date 
factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty  including homes in retailer inventories and homes purchased by consumers still within the twelve month warranty period  and the historical average costs incurred to service a home 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
property  plant and equipment the recoverability of property  plant and equipment is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  primarily based on estimated selling prices  appraised values or projected undiscounted cash flows 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy and operating conditions 
additionally  we use estimates of fair market values to establish impairment reserves for permanently closed facilities that are held for sale 
past evaluations of property  plant and equipment have resulted in significant impairment charges primarily for closed manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers including charges in the third quarter of significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
income taxes deferred tax assets and income tax refunds deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the requirements established in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recording of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we incurred significant pretax losses in the last four years 
additionally  the manufactured housing industry continues to be challenged by limited availability of consumer and floor plan financing  high industry consumer repossession levels and an uncertain economic outlook  resulting in a continued decline in manufacturing shipments and retail sales 
after consideration of 
table of contents these factors  in the second quarter of  we provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets will continue to require a valuation allowance until the company has demonstrated their realizability through sustained profitability and or from other factors 
the valuation allowance will be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred tax assets are realized as a reduction of taxes otherwise payable on any future earnings or a portion or all of the valuation allowance is otherwise no longer required 
tax refunds of million were received during the second quarter of from the filing of our federal income tax return and the carryback of the net operating loss 
due to the size of the tax refund the internal revenue service may examine our federal tax return 
the outcome of any potential examination of the federal tax return is not possible to predict 
we have evaluated the need for tax reserves based on current and prior year tax filings and in increased our tax reserves by recording a million allowance for potential tax adjustments 
goodwill remaining goodwill is related to our manufacturing operations 
we test for goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate the fair value of our manufacturing segment versus its carrying value in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
when estimating fair value  we calculate the present value of future cash flows based on forecasted sales volumes  the number of homebuilding facilities in operation  current industry and economic conditions  historical results and inflation 
past evaluations of goodwill have resulted in significant impairment charges for retail segment goodwill including a charge in the third quarter of significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or differences between estimates and actual results could result in impairment charges in the future 
wholesale repurchase reserves the majority of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with the providers of floor plan financing 
potential losses under repurchase obligations are determined by calculating the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net resale value of the homes 
probable losses under repurchase agreements are accrued based on the historical number of homes repurchased  the cost of such repurchases and the historical losses incurred  as well as the current inventory levels held at our independent retailers 
in addition  we monitor the risks associated with our independent retailers and consider these risks in our evaluation of the wholesale repurchase reserves 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our operations during the last three years 
commodity prices  including lumber  fluctuate  however  during periods of rising commodity prices the company has been able to pass the increased costs to its customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements for information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our floor plan borrowings are subject to interest primarily based on the us prime interest rate  although certain of the floor plan borrowings are subject to a minimum rate of interest  which is greater than the current prime rate 
without consideration of the minimum rate of interest on certain of the floor plan borrowings  a basis point increase in the prime rate would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately  assuming average floor plan borrowings of million  the amount of outstanding borrowings at 
table of contents january  in addition  we have obligations under industrial revenue bonds that are subject to variable interest rates tied to short term tax exempt rate indices which averaged in a basis point increase in this interest rate would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately  based on the million of debt outstanding under industrial revenue bonds at january
