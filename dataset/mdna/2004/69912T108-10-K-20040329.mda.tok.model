critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information  including the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may  under different assumptions and conditions  differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition on system sales  warranty  inventories  allowance for doubtful accounts  and asset impairments as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the securities and exchange commission

revenue recognition on systems sales revenues on systems contracts  accounted for in accordance with sop of the american institute of certified public accountants  are recorded on the basis of the company s estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts 
gross margin is recognized on the basis of the ratio of aggregate costs incurred to date to the most recent estimate of total costs 
as contracts may extend over one or more years  revisions in cost and profit estimates during the course of the work are reflected in the accounting periods in which the facts requiring revisions become known 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
as of december   there are no contracts that are anticipated to result in a loss 
the company believes that it has the ability to reasonably estimate the total costs and applicable gross profit margins at the inception of the contract for all of its systems contracts 
however  where cost estimates change  there could be a significant impact on the amount of revenue recognized 
the company s failure to estimate accurately can result in cost overruns which will result in the loss of profits if the company determines that it has significantly underestimated the costs involved in completing contracts
