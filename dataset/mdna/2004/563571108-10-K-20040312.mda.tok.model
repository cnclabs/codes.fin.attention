item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in this annual report overview the manitowoc company  inc referred to as the company  mtw  we  our  and us is a leading  diversified  multi industry manufacturer of engineered capital goods and support services for selected market segments  which today include cranes and related products crane  foodservice equipment foodservice  and marine 
the centerpiece of our efforts is and will continue to be to provide customer focused  quality products and services to the markets we serve  with the goal to continuously improve economic value for our stockholders 
the following discussion and analysis covers key drivers behind our results for and is broken down into three major sections 
first  we provide an overview of our results of operations for the years through on a consolidated basis and by business segment 
in later sections  we discuss our market conditions  acquisitions  liquidity and capital resources  and our risk management techniques 
lastly  we provide a discussion of contingent liability issues  critical accounting policies  impacts of future accounting changes  and cautionary statements

prior year amounts throughout this management discussion and analysis have been restated to reflect the reporting of these operations as discontinued 
year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales increased in to billion from billion in this increase in sales was due to the acquisition of grove investors  inc grove on august  grove was included in our consolidated financial results for a full year in versus just under five months in consolidated net sales for were also impacted by a further downturn in the us crawler crane market that began in the decline in the domestic crawler crane market was partially offset in the crane segment by modest improvements in tower and mobile telescopic crane sales in parts of europe and asia 
consolidated net sales in were also negatively impacted in our marine segment from customer deferrals of new construction projects and a union strike in the first quarter 
in addition  our consolidated net sales were bolstered by the impact that the stronger euro had on the global consolidation of our us dollar denominated financial statements 
gross margin decreased in to from in this decline was due to reduced margins in our crane and marine segments  offset by a gross margin improvement in our foodservice segment 
crane segment gross margin declined percentage points during as a result of the following items i the loss of our ability to spread fixed costs over a comparable base of revenue due to the decline in production volumes in our domestic crawler crane business  ii a shift in product mix toward smaller mobile telescopic cranes  iii worldwide price competition in our crane segment  and iv lower historical margins for the grove product line 
foodservice segment gross margin increased percentage points during as the result of facility consolidations and operational improvements 
marine segment gross margin declined percentage points during due to the following i the change in mix of new construction project work toward projects in their earlier stages  ii customer deferrals of new project awards during the year  and iii the impact of the strike at marinette marine during the first quarter of the year 
the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar in caused our manufacturing costs to increase at our european manufacturing facilities when converted to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  all of our segments experienced increased healthcare and insurance costs during versus engineering  selling and administrative expenses es a increased during to of net sales versus of net sales in this percentage increase was due to lower sales volumes in the crane and marine segments  a larger volume of new project quotation activity within our marine segment  the impact of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro in versus  and higher corporate expenses 
the increase in corporate expenses in is the result of growth due to recent acquisitions  corporate assumption of certain staff responsibilities previously handled by acquired companies  and increases in health and insurance costs 
in addition  during  we invested in the development and introduction of new products within both our crane and foodservice segments 
our investment in new products resulted in increases in research and development spending as well as additional engineering costs 
during  the crane segment introduced new products  while the foodservice segment introduced new products 
offsetting these increases in es a costs  the total es a expenses were less in the foodservice and marine segments in than they were in by and  respectively 
all three of our segments took several actions to control and reduce certain es a expenses in and future years 
these actions included the continued consolidation of crane segment facilities in europe  closure of our national crane facility in waverly  nebraska  consolidating support functions  and  consolidations of certain of our beverage equipment distribution facilities 
amortization expense of million during increased over the million reported in this increase in amortization expense in was the result of a full year of amortization of patents acquired in the grove acquisition during the third quarter of and the increased us dollar translation of amortization expenses denominated in euros 
throughout  we completed certain restructuring activities primarily within our crane segment as a continuation of the grove acquisition in as well as other initiatives to reduce our overall fixed cost structure 
we recorded a total of million in restructuring costs during of this amount  million was the result of the write down of the values of certain properties in the us and europe that were made redundant as a result of our integration and reorganization activities 
our european crane operations also recognized million in restructuring costs associated with the closure of certain facilities and the relocation of inventory  equipment and people to other facilities 
we also recorded million in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our national crane production facility in waverly  nebraska  and the relocation of the production of our national boom truck product line to our facility in shady grove  pennsylvania 
in addition  our foodservice segment recorded million in restructuring costs associated with the closure of its ice machine production facility in italy to be relocated to china and the disposal of our multiplex facility in st 
louis  missouri 
during  we recognized a million curtailment gain as the result of certain amendments to our postretirement health benefit plan  which will reduce the amount of certain benefits participants will receive in future years 
after taking all of the above matters into account  our consolidated operating earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million  which was lower than consolidated operating earnings in were of net sales compared to of net sales in interest expense during of million was higher than the million recorded during this increase in is due to a full year s worth of interest expense related to the senior subordinated notes due these notes were issued in august to complete the grove acquisition 
in addition  the increase in the euro versus us dollar exchange rate caused increased expense associated with our million euro denominated senior subordinated notes due the weighted average interest rate paid on all outstanding debt at december  was as compared to at december  during  we paid down million of outstanding term debt due to strong cash flows 
only million of our debt payments were required during the year 
the remaining million of debt reduction in was prepayments 
during  we incurred million in costs resulting from these prepayments  of which million was due to the write off of deferred financing fees  and million was costs incurred to unwind certain interest rate swaps 
the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was  compared to in the decrease in our effective tax rate in was due to the impact of certain global tax planning initiatives as well as the impact of fixed permanent book tax differences on significantly lower pre tax income 
discontinued operations include the results of operations of a portion of our aerial work platform awp business  our company owned crane distribution company located in the mid western united states  femco machine company  inc  and the costs associated with the sale or closure of these businesses 
in addition  discontinued operations include the cost associated with the final purchase price adjustment from the sale of manitowoc boom trucks inc in the portions of our awp business which were discontinued were the liftlux product line and facility located in dillingen  germany  our scissor lift and boom lift product categories  and our us manlift product line 
during we recorded a million charge million net of tax related to the decision to exit these awp product categories and facilities 
this total charge is made up of the following items i million for early termination of a facility lease contract  ii million for the write down of certain inventory to its estimated realizable value  iii million for employee severance  iv million for the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge in the awp reporting unit in the second quarter of  and v million for other asset impairment charges and estimated costs to close these operations 
year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion  from just under billion for the same period in a significant portion of this increase is the result of the acquisitions in our crane segment 
results for included a partial year of grove  which we completed on august   and a full year of potain  which was acquired on may  during foodservice segment net sales increased and marine segment sales increased versus the prior year 
the foodservice increase was due to increased volumes in our ice and beverage businesses during the second half of  as well as increased sales volumes in our private label residential refrigerator product throughout the year 
the sales increase in our marine segment was due to strong new construction activity versus the prior year including several us coast guard buoy tenders  and the start up of production on one of three staten island ferries and a great lakes ice breaker for the us coast guard 
gross margin decreased in to from in gross margin in the crane segment declined percentage points in versus cost of sales for includes a fourth quarter charge of million associated with expensing acquired grove inventory at fair market value rather than actual production costs 
future periods will not been affected by similar charges because all of the write up to fair value of the acquired inventory was reflected through costs of sales in the decline in gross margin in versus also resulted from lower volumes in our crane segment and historically lower gross margins from the grove product lines 
gross margin in the foodservice segment decreased approximately percentage points in the gross margin in our marine segment decreased percentage points in versus this decrease is primarily the result of a continued shift in the mix of revenues to lower margin project work versus higher margin repair work 
in addition  all of our segments were impacted by higher healthcare costs in es a expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to the majority of this increase was the result of the acquisition of grove august  and potain in may  and increased healthcare costs across the company 
these three items accounted for approximately million of the million increase 
the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of increased engineering expenses in the crane and foodservice segments for new product development and increases in corporate expense as corporate assumed certain staff responsibilities previously handled in the business units of the acquired companies 
as a percent of sales  es a decreased slightly to of net sales in versus for the year ended december  we took several actions in to control es a expense in the current and future years 
these actions include consolidation of the multiplex operation within the foodservice segment and implementing a reorganization plan in the crane segment following the grove acquisition 
amortization expense decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this decrease is the result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment tests at each reporting unit 
we adopted these new accounting rules for goodwill and other intangible assets on january  under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 we identified our reporting units  performed impairment tests on the net goodwill and other intangible assets associated with each of the reporting units using a valuation date of january   and determined that a transitional goodwill impairment charge of million million net of income tax was required 
this impairment related to our reporting units as follows beverage group foodservice segment million and manitowoc boom trucks inc crane segment million 
this charge was based upon current economic conditions in those industries 
the impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of earnings in the first quarter of in accordance with the transitional provisions of sfas no 
under previous accounting requirements  no goodwill impairment would have been recorded on january  during the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million in connection with the consolidation of our multiplex operations into our other foodservice operations 
we took these actions to streamline our cost structure and utilize available capacity 
the charge included million to write down the building and land  which was held for sale  to estimated fair market value less cost to sell  million for the write down of certain equipment  and million related to severance and other employee related costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge associated with the completion of certain integration activities related to the grove acquisition and certain other restructuring activities in the crane segment 
this charge included million related to severance and other employee related costs for headcount reductions at various manitowoc crane and potain facilities  million related to the write down of certain property  plant and equipment  and million related to lease termination costs 
after taking all of these matters into account  consolidated operating earnings for the year ended december   were million  or of sales 
this compares with million  or of sales  for the year ended december  interest expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in this increase was due to additional interest expense related to the senior subordinated notes due  which were issued in august to complete the grove acquisition  additional amortization of debt issue costs related to these notes  and a full year of interest expense and amortization of debt issue costs related to the debt incurred for the potain acquisition in may the weighted average interest rate paid on all outstanding debt as of december  was 
the effective tax rate was compared to in the effective rate for approximated the combined domestic federal and state statutory rate reduced by lower foreign effective rates 
the lower effective rate reflects the benefits of our global tax planning initiatives and the reduction of non deductible goodwill amortization associated with our adoption of sfas no 
discontinued operations include the results of operations of a portion of our aerial work platform awp business  our company owned crane distribution company located in the mid western united states  femco machine company  inc  femco manitowoc boom trucks  inc 
manitowoc boom trucks  and the costs associated with the sale or closure of these businesses 
the portions of our awp business which were discontinued were the liftlux product line and facility located in dillingen  germany  the discontinuation of production of our scissor lift and boom lift product categories  as well as the discontinuation of our us manlift product line 
in connection with the grove acquisition  the united states department of justice raised concerns about a possible reduction in competition in the united states boom truck market that could result from the acquisition 
in order to address these concerns  the company and grove agreed with the department of justice that  following the completion of the grove acquisition  we would divest of either manitowoc boom trucks  inc or national crane corporation grove s boom truck business 
on december   we entered into an agreement with quantum heavy equipment  llc to sell all of the outstanding stock of manitowoc boom trucks 
the department of justice approved the sale on december   and it was completed on december  in addition  during the fourth quarter of we finalized our decision to offer femco for sale 
femco was our crane and excavator aftermarket replacement parts and industrial repair business 
after the grove acquisition  it was determined that femco was not a core business to the crane segment 
femco was sold in february during december  we recorded a million million net of income taxes charge related to the decision to divest of femco 
of the charge  million related to recording the net assets of femco at fair value less cost to sell based on internal estimates 
in addition  we performed an impairment analysis of the femco goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 and determined that the entire million of goodwill was impaired 
the cumulative million charge was recorded in discontinued operations 
at december   the assets and liabilities of femco were recorded as held for sale in other non current assets and liabilities  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheet 
sales and operating earnings by segment operating earnings reported below by segment include the impact of reductions due to restructurings and plant consolidations whereas these expenses were separately identified in the results of consolidated operations table above 
cranes and related products segment prior year sales and operating earnings of the crane segment have been restated for the discontinued operations of awp  north central crane  manitowoc boom trucks  and femco 
in thousands net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to net sales in the crane segment increased in compared to this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of grove on august  a full year of grove sales is included in the crane segment results for grove s net sales for the period from january  through august  were million compared to zero in prior to its acquisition 
crane segment net sales in were also impacted by the continued and further downturn in the us crawler crane market that began for us in this decline in the crawler crane market was partially offset by modest improvements in tower and mobile telescopic crane sales in parts of europe and asia 
in addition  the strengthening of the euro as compared to the us dollar during resulted in an increase in the us dollar equivalent for sales denominated in euro versus the prior year 
crane segment backlog stood at million at december   versus million at december  crane segment operating earnings decreased million in versus  which represents an operating margin decrease of percentage points 
a portion of the decrease is attributable to the inclusion of million in restructuring costs as a reduction of crane operating earnings in versus million in these costs included million for write down of certain properties to their net realizable value 
approximately million in restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our waverly  nebraska production into shady grove  and million for the completion of our restructuring activities associated with our potain workforce and facilities in europe 
crane segment operating earnings were also negatively impacted by the following i lower volumes in our domestic crawler crane business  ii a shift in product mix in the mobile telescopic product category to smaller capacity units  iii worldwide price competition across all product categories  and iv lower historical gross margins from the grove product line 
year ended december  compared to net sales in the crane segment increased to million in compared to this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of grove in august and a full year of potain sales in grove s net sales since the date of acquisition and potain s net sales from january  through may  were million  and million  respectively 
the crane segment experienced a dramatic slowdown in the third quarter of  which continued into the fourth quarter led primarily by decreased volumes in the crawler crane product category and the domestic market 
during the first half of  our crane sales outperformed the market and remained relatively stable compared to the overall industry  which was declining at a rate exceeding 
beginning in the third quarter  our sales declined closer to industry rates 
crane segment backlog stood at million at december   versus million at december  the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of grove during excluding grove  the backlog stood at million at december  the decrease in backlog  excluding grove  is due to the weakened economic conditions that slowed the sales of our crawler cranes 
crane segment operating earnings of million include a reduction of million for restructuring costs 
this represents an reduction in operating earnings in compared to crane segment operating earnings in also include the full year impact of potain operating earnings and the impact of grove operating earnings since the date of acquisition 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the crane segment recognized a million charge for expensing acquired grove inventory at fair market value rather than actual production costs 
the remaining decrease in crane segment operating earnings in compared to occurred primarily as the result of the lower crawler crane production levels due to the sales decline discussed above 
foodservice equipment segment in thousands net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales decreased in compared to this decrease was the result of lower overall industry shipments in the segment s ice and beverage divisions 
for the full year  industry shipments of ice machines were down approximately 
despite these industry trends  the segment s ice division reflected increased sales in compared to  increasing our market share 
beverage equipment sales in showed negative comparisons to due to a major chain new equipment rollout that occurred in the fourth quarter of that did not reoccur in the company s private label residential refrigerator division net sales in remained flat compared to new product introductions by our foodservice segment bolstered sales results with the introduction of new products  including the initial rollout of its new s series ice machine product during the fourth quarter of the year 
foodservice segment operating earnings increased in versus despite the slight decline in net sales 
the significant improvement in operating earnings was due to the strenght of the ice division sales  facility consolidation  continued operational improvements across all of the divisions  and lower restructuring costs in million compared to million 
the restructuring costs included million for closure of the company s italian ice machine production facility and movement of production to china 
the remaining restructuring costs were recorded as a result of the additional loss on final disposition of the segment s multiplex production facility located in st 
louis  missouri 
in summary  the operating earnings increase of far outpaced the netsales decline of due to favorable mix of sales  operational improvements and facility consolidation 
year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales increased to million in compared to levels 
this increase was primarily due to increased sales of ice and beverage products throughout the second half of the year  as well as increases in our private label residential refrigeration product throughout the year  while sales of commercial refrigeration products remained flat 
we attributed this to commercial refrigeration s dependency on new store construction  which has been slower to recover compared with the replacement  expansion  and remodeling activity that boosted ice and beverage equipment 
for the full year  industry shipments of ice machines were up approximately 
new products played a key roll in our sales growth as several of our foodservice businesses had major new product introductions during the year 
operating earnings of the foodservice segment decreased million  or  in compared to this decrease is primarily due to a million restructuring charge taken by the foodservice segment during for the consolidation of our multiplex operations into other foodservice operations 
this improvement in the foodservice segment s operating margin was due to growth and related margin contributions in our ice  beverage and residential refrigerator operations  further cost reduction benefits from implementation of manufacturing operational improvements across all the segment s businesses  and consolidations within our beverage and refrigeration operations 
marine segment in thousands net sales operating earnimgs operating margin year ended december  compared to marine segment net sales decreased in versus this decrease was due in part to the impact of the day union strike at marinette marine in the first quarter of the strike slowed ship construction progress 
the impact of customer deferrals of awarding new construction contracts in the second half also contributed to the decrease 
in addition  several ships that were scheduled to dock at our facilities on the great lakes in the fourth quarter of were rescheduled for winter dry docking until the first quarter of as many of these boats remained active longer than expected 
operating earnings in the marine segment decreased million  or in compared to the reasons for this decline are the following i the change in mix of new construction project work toward newer projects and more commercial construction contracts  ii customer deferrals of new project awards during the year  iii the impact of the first quarter strike at marinette marine on project construction progress and efficiency  and iv additional costs incurred in on bidding for new project contracts 
these negative pressures on operating earnings were offset slightly by an increase in ship repair activities during compared to year ended december  compared to new construction activity was strong throughout the year and resulted in marine segment net sales increasing to million in compared to our new construction projects included several buoy tenders and a great lakes icebreaker for the us coast guard  in addition to the start up of construction on the first of three staten island ferries for the city of new york 
operating earnings increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due primarily to new construction growth 
operating margins in decreased approximately percentage points compared to we have experienced a decline in demand for higher margin repair work for more than two years  primarily due to issues affecting the steel industry  low water levels on the great lakes  and the general domestic economic conditions 
general corporate expenses in thousands corporate expenses of sales year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased in versus  but remained flat as a percentage of net sales at 
the reasons for the million increase year over year include additional personnel and related benefits resulting from our growth and the assumption of certain staff responsibilities previously handled by acquired companies  costs of compliance with new governmental regulations  certain reserves for litigation  and additional depreciation expense 
year ended december  compared to despite increasing in  corporate expenses remained constant as a percentage of net sales 
this reflects both the growth from acquisition and corporate assumption of certain staff responsibilities previously handled in the field 
market conditions and outlook during  nearly percent of our crane segment revenues and percent of our consolidated net sales were from international markets 
the increases were the result of strategies to diversify our geographic base and product offering during the continued downturn in the us crane market  especially for the crawler crane products 
while penetration in global markets is helpful to us  it also adds complexity and susceptability to global risks and issues 
specifically  the issues of the strengthening euro versus the us dollar throughout  and the impact of worldwide steel market activities on the costs of steel for our manufacturing processes  impacted us during the year and will continue to provide challenges and opportunities in with the end of the war in iraq  certain markets have now become available to us that were not available in past years  but continued unrest in iraq and the middle east in general  have stymied significant immediate growth in that region 
the us economy appears to have hit the bottom in our end markets 
we are seeing preliminary signs of recovery in the us  while certain european and asian economies also appear to be strengthening 
although the signs appear to be favorable  we are cautiously optimistic about the strength and significance of the us or any global economic recovery 
we have not planned for any significant recoveries in and we will continue to protect our market shares and improve our cost structures so that we increase our benefits when the economies do rebound 
because of our efforts to become more global in our crane and foodservice businesses  we continue to be affected now more than ever by non domestic world economies 
the economies of europe and asia  in particular  affect our international performance 
we believe that our diversified business model in terms of global presence and broad product offerings proved beneficial to us in and will continue to provide stability to our company into the future 
the strength of our foodservice segment performance in helped to offset relatively weaker performances in our crane and marine segments 
diversification within our segments also proves beneficial 
in our crane segment  stronger international performance  particularly in some parts of europe and asia  helped to lessen the continued impact of a weak north american crawler crane market 
cranes and related products the crane market continued its decline during with the exception of the chinese market  most of our global markets were down in the continued decline in the north american crane market was most pronounced  especially the crawler crane market  which declined by over percent from pricing has been competitive on a global basis 
declining market prices accelerated in the second half of as we head into however  we believe that the decline in volumes and prices  in general  has now stabilized 
during  we grew market share in most product segments in north america and europe 
in addition  we grew market share in many of our asian markets and made inroads in south america 
we are investing in infrastructure in asia so that we can continue to grow faster in that market place 
during  we also formed an alliance with kobelco construction machinery company  a large japanese construction equipment manufacturer 
we continue to invest in new products and product support 
in  we introduced new products in the crane segment  which is the most that the crane segment has introduced in one year 
looking into  we expect volumes to be flat to slightly up from on worldwide basis 
we believe that we have seen the bottom of the market  but at this point we are not seeing any significant signs of a recovery 
in addition  we believe we will continue to see a relatively strong euro through  as well as increased costs of some commodities such as steel 
we have plans to adapt to these conditions 
in this environment we plan to protect our market share by providing our customers with what we believe is the best value in the industry 
we will also work to grow our market share globally by leveraging the strength of our brand names and expanded product offering 
in we plan to introduce new models 
we will also continue to expand our global reach 
one way to achieve this expansion is through the strategic positioning of our sales and product support infrastructure in asia 
in addition  our global sales force is cross selling our entire product line 
our recent acquisitions of potain and grove have given us a broad product offering and worldwide distribution and product support 
we believe these factors will help us grow market share in in addition  we made great strides in to streamline our cost structure 
we have essentially completed the integration of grove  including the rationalization of our awp business  and the consolidation of our north american boom truck production into our shady grove facility 
these consolidation and restructuring efforts have resulted in annual savings of million over our cost base 
we believe that our growth strategy is solid and supported by the diversification of our global manufacturing and distribution presence 
we will continue to attack our markets geographically  rather than by product line 
foodservice equipment in  the foodservice segment introduced more than new products 
we believe these new product introductions helped us to outperform our industries during as we held sales steady in generally declining markets 
during  we believe that our key markets hit the bottom of their cycles 
we believe these markets are beginning to improve 
during the last quarter of  we experienced positive trends in year over year  same store sales improvements in many of our customers segments  including the quick serve segment 
in addition  we are seeing continued strengthening in the full service and quick casual dining segments  and rising lodging rates in the lodging industry 
industry experts generally predict a two to two and a half percent growth in foodservice equipment and supply sales for the same factors that drove our strong operating performance in will continue to drive our business in as the market improves  we expect to outperform the industry on the top line due to our wide range of new products that were introduced in and that continue to be rolled out in our strategy is to generate eighty percent of revenues from products introduced in the previous five years 
we also will continue to invest in foreign markets during we plan to build a new engineering and manufacturing operations center in china 
our plan is to relocate our existing operation to a new  larger and more high tech facility  which will include manufacturing space  global procurement  and other global regional centers of excellence 
initially  we will manufacture ice machines and beverage equipment in this facility  but plan to expand to manufacture other products for this region 
marine the marine segment had a difficult year in due to a number of factors  some of which were internal  but most of which were external 
one of the factors which hurt this segment during was the impact of the first quarter strike at marinette marine 
although we believe that the outcome was favorable to all parties  the resolution took longer than we had hoped 
this labor action not only impacted our first quarter operating results  but had a ripple effect on our business through the remainder of the larger issue that impacted the marine segment in was the industry conditions that caused many of our customers to defer the award of major shipbuilding contracts until late in the year 
we believe the primary causes of these deferrals were our customers uncertainty about the state of the us economy  as well as their inability to secure financing for these high dollar value projects 
once our customers began to award new construction projects later in the year  our marine segment won nearly all the major contracts that it bid on during the year 
therefore  we go into with a full slate of work in our shipyards 
in addition  with a number of these contracts  we could land additional work through changes to the project scope and options for follow on contracts 
further more we bid on three new contracts in january even though we experienced the delay in contract awards through much of  we are starting to see greater numbers of contracts out for bid at this point in as compared to the same period in we are also working intently on two major contracts that will be announced in one is the next phase of the us navy s littoral combat ship lcs project  which will involve construction of a prototype vessel  which we expect will be awarded in the second quarter of we have been selected as a finalist  with our partners  lockheed martin  gibbs cox  and bollinger shipyards  for the lcs project 
furthermore  we are one of three companies in the running for a vessel response boat medium rbm contract  which the us coast guard is expected to award in august the improving us economy is helping buoy our shipbuilding business 
we are beginning to see more impact on ship construction demand due to the opa legislation  as all current us waterway oil hauling vessels will begin to be phased out in  and must be replaced with double hull vessels 
another positive sign is that charter rates are beginning to increase worldwide  which means additional revenue for commercial customers that can be used to build new vessels 
despite these positive economic indicators  however  there are two key issues which will impact our end markets in the first issue continues to be the ability of our customers to find and secure adequate financing to support their new ship construction initiatives 
the second issue will be the financial strength of a portion of our non governmental customer base  which is negatively impacted by the poor financial condition and outlook for us steel manufacturers and customers in the supply chain for those companies 
our marine segment plans to continue to pursue new construction activities  provide superior repair and maintenance support to our customers  and work with other shipyards to provide integrated solutions to our mutual customers as the need arises 
acquisitions our growth in  and was mainly due to our acquisitions in these years 
over the past five years we have completed eleven acquisitions 
all of them were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
each of these acquisitions is included in our consolidated statement of earnings beginning with the date of acquisition 
the success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses  operate them profitably  and accomplish our strategic objectives underlying these acquisitions 
we attempt to address these challenges by adhering to a structured acquisition assessment and integration process and by employing appropriate internal resources and experienced personnel to assist us in accomplishing our objectives 
acquisitions on august  we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of grove investors  inc grove 
the results of grove s operations have been included in the consolidated statements of earnings since that date 
grove is a leading provider of mobile telescopic cranes  truck mounted cranes  boom trucks and aerial work platforms for the global market 
grove s products are used in a wide variety of applications by commercial and residential building contractors as well as by industrial  municipal  and military end users 
grove s products are marketed to independent equipment rental companies and directly to end users under the brand names grove crane  national crane  and grove manlift 
we view grove as a strategic fit with our crane business for a number of reasons 
grove is a global leader in the mobile telescopic crane industry  specifically in all terrain and rough terrain mobile telescopic cranes 
we did not offer these types of cranes prior to the acquisition  so grove filled this void in our product offering 
coupled with our entrance into the tower crane product line with the acquisition of potain sas in  grove enables us to offer customers four major crane categories  namely crawler cranes  tower cranes  mobile telescopic cranes and boom trucks 
with the addition of grove  we are able to offer customers equipment and lifting solutions for virtually every construction application 
we also believe that the combination of the two companies will provide opportunities to capitalize on their respective strengths in systems  technologies and manufacturing expertise  and that this combination will create natural synergies in its worldwide distribution and service network 
the aggregate purchase price paid for grove was million 
this includes the issuance of million of our common stock  the assumption of million of grove debt outstanding as of august   and direct acquisition costs of million 
in exchange for the outstanding shares of grove common stock  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock out of treasury with an average market price of per share 
the number of shares issued at the close of the transaction was calculated based on the average closing price of our common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on and including the second day prior to the closing of the transaction 
in addition  we assumed all of grove s outstanding liabilities approximately million including the outstanding debt  contingencies and commitments 
substantially all of the assumed debt was refinanced 
the purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated first to the identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess accounted for as goodwill

the million of goodwill is included in the crane segment 
none of this amount is deductible for tax purposes 
we also obtained third party valuations of the fair value of inventory and property  plant and equipment acquired 
based upon the appraisal reports of these assets  we increased the value of inventory and property  plant and equipment by million and million  respectively 
the million fair value adjustment to inventory was charged to cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of as the related inventory items were sold 
the million fair value adjustment to property  plant and equipment is being depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives of the property  plant and equipment

during the fourth quarter of we made a million dollar adjustment to the potain opening balance sheet for the reversal of the valuation allowance against an acquired net operating loss carryforward 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this was applied to capital spending  dividends and a reduction in debt 
we had million in cash and short term investments along with million of unused availability under the terms of the revolving credit portion of our senior credit facility at december  on november   the company completed the sale of million of senior notes due senior notes due 
the senior notes due are unsecured senior obligations ranking prior to the company s senior subordinated notes due and senior subordinated notes due the company s collateralized senior indebtedness  including indebtedness under its senior credit facility  ranks equally with the senior notes due  except that the senior credit facility is collateralized by substantially all domestic tangible and intangible assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
the senior notes due are fully and unconditionally jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
interest on the senior notes due is payable semiannually in may and november each year  commencing may  the senior notes due can be redeemed by the company in whole or in part for a premium on or after november  in addition  the company may redeem for a premium of the face amount of the notes  plus interest at any time prior to november  up to of the face amount of the senior notes due with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes due for the prepayment of our term loan a and partial prepayment of the term loan b under the senior credit facility 
we incurred approximately million in financing fees in connection with the sale of these notes 
the company also incurred approximately million of financing fees in related to senior debt covenants amendments 
this amount is included debt issue costs of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we spent a total of million during for capital expenditures 
the following table summarizes capital expenditures and depreciation by segment 
in thousands capital expenditures depreciation crane foodservice marine corporate total we continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our business  to invest in new processes and technology  and to maintain high quality production standards 
we expect that the trend in capital expenditures in will approximate segment depreciation levels 
as a result  we expect that our total capital expenditures should be near million in the change in working capital of continuing operations was a decrease source of cash of million 
the details of these changes are reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the drivers of this decrease were an increase in short term payables of million  a decrease in inventory of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  and an increase in other liabilities of million 
our outstanding debt at december   consisted primarily of our senior subordinated notes due  senior subordinated notes due  senior notes due  and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility is comprised of a million term loan a  a million term loan b and million revolving credit facility 
as a result of scheduled payments and prepayments made since  we have no amounts outstanding under our term loan a and million outstanding under our term loan b  which requires quarterly principal payments of million from december through march  and quarterly principal payments of million from june through may there was no amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin  which is based on our consolidated total leverage ratio  as defined by the senior credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate for the term loan b facility was at december  the annual commitment fee in effect on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility was at december  we had million of unused availability under the terms of our revolving credit facility at december  to help finance the potain acquisition in may  we issued million euro approximately million at december  exchange rates of senior subordinated notes due may senior subordinated notes due 
the senior subordinated notes due are unsecured obligations ranking subordinate in right of payment to all senior debt  rank equal to the senior subordinated notes due  and are fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on the senior subordinated notes due is payable semiannually in may and november of each year 
the senior subordinated notes due can be redeemed in whole or in part by the company for a premium after may  in addition  we may redeem for a premium of the face amount of the notes  plus interest at any time prior to may   up to of the face amount of the senior subordinated notes due with the proceeds from one or more public equity offerings 
as part of the grove acquisition in august  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due august senior subordinated notes due 
the senior subordinated notes due are unsecured obligations ranking subordinate in right of payment to all senior debt  rank equal to the senior subordinated notes due and are fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on the senior subordinated notes due is payable semiannually in february and august each year  commencing february  the senior subordinated notes due can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium on or after august  in addition  we may redeem for a premium of the face amount of the notes  plus interest  at any time prior to august   up to of the face amount of the senior subordinated notes due with the proceeds from one or more public equity offerings 
our debt to capital ratio at the end of was versus at the end of this decrease was driven by repayment of debt during  which was partially offset by foreign currency exchange rates 
the senior credit facility  senior notes due and senior subordinated notes due and contain customary affirmative and negative covenants 
in general  the covenants contained in the senior credit facility are more restrictive than those of the senior notes due and senior subordinated notes due and among other restrictions  the senior credit facility covenants had required us to meet specified financial tests  which included minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  and various debt to ebitda ratios which became more restrictive over time 
these covenants also limited the company s ability to redeem or repurchase its debt  incur additional debt  make acquisitions  merge with other entities  pay dividends or distributions  repurchase capital stock  lend money or make advances  create or become subject to liens  and make capital expenditures 
the senior credit facility also contains cross default provisions whereby certain defaults under any other debt agreements would result in default under the senior credit facility 
at december   the company was not in compliance with certain of its financial covenants 
on february   the company received an amendment and waiver to its credit agreement dated may   which cured these violations 
in addition  this amendment provided future relief under certain financial covenants that became more restrictive over time 
at june   the company was not in compliance with certain of its financial covenants 
on july   the company received an amendment and waiver to its senior credit agreement dated may   which cured these violations 
in addition  the amendment eliminates the minimum ebitda covenants and provides future relief under certain financial covenants that became more restrictive over time 
the non financial test covenants discussed above are still in place under the amended senior credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with all covenants as of december   and based upon our current plans and outlook  the company believes it will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent month period 
in april  standard poor s assigned a double b corporate credit rating to our company  a double b rating to our senior credit facility  and a single b plus rating to our senior subordinated notes  all with a stable outlook 
also in april  moody s investors service assigned a ba rating to our senior credit facility and a b rating to our senior subordinated notes with a positive outlook 
in march  standard poor s issued a press release stating that we had been placed on credit watch with negative implications 
in july  standard poor s removed the credit watch  but changed it s outlook from stable to negative 
in july  standard poor s lowered our corporate credit rating from a double b to a double b minus  lowered the rating to our senior credit facility from a double b to a double b minus and lowered the rating on our senior subordinated notes from a single b plus to a single b 
moody s investors service has taken no action concerning our rating since initiating them in april we do not anticipate any future adjustments to these ratings would have a material impact on our liquidity 
our debt position increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions and results in a significant portion of our cash flow from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt and making scheduled principal payments 
this could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities 
our ability to service our debt is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not subject to our control  such as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  and regulatory factors 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional funds under the senior credit facility in the future will depend on our meeting the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  even after taking into account such new borrowings 
the senior credit facility or other future facilities may be used for funding future acquisitions  seasonal working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other investing and financing needs 
we believe that our available cash  credit facility  cash generated from future operations  and access to debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund our capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
management also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that require disclosure a 
our senior credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests to comply with the terms of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   the latest measurement date 
the occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations under the senior credit facility approximately million as of december  and foreclosure on the collateral related to such obligations 
further  such an acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes due and and our senior notes due b 
circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential  or that could render that activity commercially impracticable  such as the inability to maintain a specified investment grade credit rating  level of earnings  earnings per share  financial ratios  or collateral 
we do not believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our historical operations at this time 
c 
factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
we do not presently believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to materially affect our credit ratings or would otherwise adversely affect our ability to raise short term or long term financing 
d 
we do not have any significant guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties 
we have disclosed information related to guarantees in note to our consolidated financial statements 
e 
written options on non financial assets for example  real estate puts 
we do not have any written options on non financial assets 
off balance sheet arrangements our disclosures concerning transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to affect materially liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources are as follows we have disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements our buyback and residual value guarantee commitments 
we also lease various assets under operating leases 
the future estimated payments under these arrangements are also disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have disclosed our accounts receivable factoring arrangement with a bank in note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of december  is as follows total committed thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total committed there were no significant purchase obligations commitments at december additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million 
we also had buyback commitments and residual value guarantees outstanding  that if all were satisfied at december   the total cash cost to us would be million 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the pension plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  cash contributions to the pension plans by us were million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities  and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate treasury and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use  please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk in we used interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements such that approximately of our debt is fixed rate and is floating 
under these swap agreements  we contract with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rates and floating rates applied to the notional amount of the swaps 
at december   we had outstanding one floating to fixed interest rate swap with a financial institution 
the fair value of the swap is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet  with changes in fair value recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss account within stockholders equity 
the interest payments or receipts from the interest rate swap are recognized in net earnings as adjustments to interest expense on a current basis 
at december   the floating to fixed interest rate swap had a notional amount of million  interest rate of and maturity date of august the aggregate fair value of this swap agreement was negative million at december  in addition  as a result of prepayments made during we unwound a portion of this interest rate swap and recorded a charge of million in the consolidated statement of earnings as a component of early extinguishment of debt 
our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from our outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to a short term international bank lending rate 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense net of impact of interest rate swaps of approximately million 
this amount was calculated assuming the year end rate of interest on our variable rate debt was constant throughout the year 
as of december   we also have entered into five fixed to floating interest rate swaps with financial institutions 
these swap contracts effectively convert million of our fixed rate senior subordinated and senior notes to variable rate debt 
under these swap agreements  we contract with a counter party to exchange the difference between a floating rate and the fixed rate applied to million of our senior subordinated and senior notes 
these contracts are considered to be a hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate obligations 
accordingly  these interest rate swap contracts are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet at december   as an asset of million and a liability of million and the related debt is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the interest rate swap contract  as well as the offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the change in the fair value of the swaps exactly offsets the change in fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt  therefore  there was no net impact on earnings from these swaps for the year ended december  a increase or decrease in the floating rate we pay under these swap agreements would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately million 
this amount was calculated assuming the year end weighted average rate of the swaps was constant throughout the year 
interest swaps expose us to the risk that the counter party may be unable to pay amounts it owes us under the swap agreements 
to manage this risk we enter into swap agreements only with financial institutions that have high credit ratings 
commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  including steel  copper  and aluminum 
each of our business segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices 
we have established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices 
some of these programs are centralized within business segments  and others are specific to a business unit 
in  certain of these commodities  notably steel  have become subject to abnormal availability and price increase pressures 
although we have established procedures in place to manage these pressures  no guarantee of success can be made at this time 
currency risk we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
international sales  including those sales that originated outside of the united states  were approximately of our total sales for  with the largest percentage being sales into various european countries 
although the vast majority of our international sales which originate within the united states are denominated in us dollars  with the acquisitions of grove in and potain in  we are more exposed to transactional and translational foreign exchange risk in recent years 
regarding transactional foreign exchange risk  we enter into limited forward exchange contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow impact on nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables  predominantly between our euro denominated operations and their customers outside the euro zone 
gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged 
the maturities of these forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement date of the related transactions 
we also periodically hedge anticipated transactions  primarily at firm order date for orders to be sold into non euro denominated locations  with forward exchange contracts 
these forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   we had outstanding million of forward exchange contracts hedging outstanding firm orders and million of forward exchange contracts hedging underlying accounts receivable 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december   would not have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of earnings 
this is because any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging accounts receivable balances would be offset by equal gains or losses on the underlying receivables 
any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging outstanding firm orders would not have a significant impact due to the relatively immaterial amount of contracts outstanding being hedged 
our primary translation exchange risk exposure at december   was with the euro 
to a much lesser extent  we are also exposed to translation risk with our other foreign operations  primarily in the united kingdom and in china 
our euro denominated million senior subordinated notes due offsets a significant amount of the translation risk with our operating movement europe 
in addition  a large amount of the translation risk with our chinese operations are naturally hedged with locally denominated debt 
the currency effects of these foreign denominated debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss account within stockholders equity  where they offset the translation impact of an equal amount of similarly foreign denominated net assets of our european and chinese operations 
a appreciation or depreciation of the value of the euro to the us dollar at december  would have the impact of increasing or decreasing the outstanding debt balance on our consolidated balance sheet by million 
this impact would be partially offset by gains and losses on our net investments in foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro 
continued expected strength in the euro versus the us dollar in will require us to manage the transactional exchange risk through continued use of foreign currency hedging 
in addition  relative currency values will impact our strategic and operational activities 
at december   there was also a portion of our foreign currency translation exposure that was not hedged 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange can affect our stockholders equity 
amounts invested in non us based subsidiaries are translated into non us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
the cumulative translation adjustment component of stockholders equity at december   is negative million  or approximately of total stockholders equity 
using year end exchange rates  the total amount invested in foreign operations at december  was approximately million of which approximately million was naturally hedged with local  non us dollar debt 
environmental  health  safety and other matters our global operations are governed by laws addressing the protection of the environment  workers safety  and health 
under various circumstances  these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines  as well as injunctive and remedial relief  for noncompliance 
they also may require remediation at sites where company related substances have been released into the environment 
we have expended substantial resources globally  both financial and managerial  to comply with the applicable laws and regulations  and to protect the environment and our workers 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with such laws and regulations and we maintain procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance 
however  we have been and may in the future be subject to formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or regulations  whether or not determined to be ultimately responsible in the normal course of business 
historically  these actions have been resolved in various ways with the regulatory authorities without material commitments or penalties to the company 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla in connection with the lemberger landfill superfund site near manitowoc  wisconsin 
approximately potentially responsible parties have been identified as having shipped hazardous materials to this site 
eleven of those  including us  have formed the lemberger site remediation group and have successfully negotiated with the united states environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources to fund the cleanup and settle our potential liability at this site 
recent estimates indicate that the total costs to clean up this site are approximately million 
however  the ultimate allocations of cost for this site are not yet final 
although liability is joint and several  our share of the liability is estimated to be of the total cost 
prior to december   we accrued million in connection with this matter 
the amounts we have spent each year through december  to comply with our portion of the cleanup costs have not been material 
remediation work at the site has been substantially completed  with only long term pumping and treating of groundwater and site maintenance remaining 
our remaining estimated liability for this matter  included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  is million 
based on the size of our current allocation of liability at this site  the existence of other viable potentially responsible parties and current reserve  we do not believe that any liability imposed in connection with this site will have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions results of operations  or cash flows 
at certain of our other facilities  we have identified potential contaminants in soil and groundwater 
the ultimate cost of any remediation required will depend upon the results of future investigation 
based upon available information  we do not expect that the ultimate costs will be material to us 
we believe that we have obtained and are in substantial compliance with those material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct our various businesses 
based on the facts presently known  we do not expect environmental compliance costs to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   various product related lawsuits were pending 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  all of these are insured with self insurance retention levels 
our self insured retention levels vary by business unit  and have fluctuated over the last five years 
the range of our self insured retention levels are million to million per occurrence 
the high end of our self insurance retention level is a legacy product liability insurance program inherited in the grove acquisition in for cranes manufactured in the united states for occurrences from through october as of december   the largest self insured retention level currently maintained by us is million per occurrence and applies to product liability for cranes manufactured in the united states 
product liability reserves in the consolidated balance sheet at december   were million  million reserved specifically for cases and million for claims incurred but not reported which were estimated using actuarial methods 
based on our experience in defending product liability claims  management believes the current reserves are adequate for estimated case resolution on aggregate self insured claims and insured claims 
any recoveries from insurance carriers are dependent upon the legal sufficiency of claims and solvency of insurance carriers 
at december  and  we had reserved million and million  respectively  for warranty claims included in product warranties and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
certain of these warranties and other related claims involve matters in dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiations  arbitration or litigation 
infrequently a material warranty issue can arise which is beyond the scope of our historical experience 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates for environmental remediation  product liability and warranty costs may change in the near future based upon new information that may arise or matters that are beyond the scope of our historical experience 
presently  there are no reliable methods to estimate the amount of any such potential changes 
we are also involved in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business  including numerous lawsuits involving asbestos related claims in which we are one of numerous defendants 
after taking into consideration legal counsel s evaluation of such actions  the current political environment with respect to asbestos related claims  and the liabilities accrued with respect to such matters  management  believes that the ultimate resolution of these claims will not to have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows 
we are also involved in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business  which  taking into account the liabilities accrued and legal counsel s evaluation of such actions  in the opinion of management  ultimate resolution is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgement and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
although we have listed a number of accounting policies below which we believe to be most critical  we also believe that all of our accounting policies are important to the reader 
therefore  please refer also to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the company 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized and earned when all the following criteria are satisfied with regard to a specific transaction persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  collectibility of cash is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenues under long term contracts within the marine segment  including contracts with the us government  are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenues are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion  and costs are expensed as incurred 
we also enter into transactions with customers that provide for residual value guarantees and buyback commitments 
these transactions are recorded as operating leases 
net proceeds received in connection with the initial transactions are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized to income on a straight line basis over a period equal to that of the customer s third party financing agreement 
in addition  we lease cranes to customers under operating lease terms 
proceeds received in connection with these transactions are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease  and leased cranes are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts based on pre established percentages to specific aging categories which are subject to change if experience improves or deteriorates 
inventories and related reserve for obsolete and excess inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using both the first in  first out fifo method and the last in  first out lifo method and are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based upon pre established percentages applied to specific aging categories of inventory 
these categories are evaluated based upon historical usage  estimated future usage  and sales requiring the inventory 
these percentages were established based upon historical write off experience 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  however  it must be tested for impairment at least annually 
amortization continues to be recorded for other intangible assets with definite lives 
on an annual basis  we test for impairment of goodwill according to a two step approach 
in the first step  we test for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair values of our reporting units using the present value of future cash flows approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to our market capitalization at the date of valuation 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
our other intangible assets with indefinite lives  including trademarks  tradenames  and in place distributor networks  are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amount 
our other intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
impairment losses on assets held for sale are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs to sell 
employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees  including pension and postretirement healthcare 
annually we record expenses relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and healthcare cost trend rates 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
we review our actuarial assumptions on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by our independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable 
based on recent returns on plan assets and the discount rate  we anticipate our funding requirements will increase between million and million in product liability we are subject in the normal course of business to product liability lawsuits 
to the extent permitted under applicable laws  our exposure to losses from these lawsuits is mitigated by insurance with self insurance retention limits 
we record product liability reserves for our self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions 
our reserve is based upon two estimates 
first  we track the population of all outstanding pending and threatened product liability cases to determine an appropriate case reserve for each based upon our best judgement and the advice of legal counsel 
these estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding the case 
second  we obtain a third party actuarial analysis to determine the amount of additional reserve required to cover incurred but not reported product liability issues and to account for possible adverse development of the established case reserve collectively referred to as ibnr 
this actuarial analysis is performed at least twice annually and our ibnr reserve for product liability is adjusted based upon the results of these analysis 
we have established a position within the actuarially determined range  which we believe is the best estimate of the ibnr liability 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recorded a valuation allowance that represents foreign operating loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain 
management judgement is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted in the event future taxable income is materially different than amounts estimated 
our policy is to remit earnings from foreign subsidiaries only to the extent any resultant foreign taxes are creditable in the united states 
accordingly  we do not currently provide for additional united states and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon remission of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
stock options we account for our stock option plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock option based employee compensation costs are reflected in earnings  as all option grants under the plans had an an excise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
warranties in the normal course of business we provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship  and in some cases materials  on products manufactured by us 
such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from months to months 
if a product fails to comply with our warranty  we may be obligated  at our expense to correct any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product 
we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our warranty at the time product revenue is recognized based on historical warranty experience for the related product or estimates of projected losses due to specific warranty issues on new products 
these costs primarily include labor and materials  as necessary associated with repair or replacement 
the primary factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims 
as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations  we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary
