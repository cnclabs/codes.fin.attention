item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate description we principally engage in the ownership  development  management and acquisition of commercial and residential real estate throughout the united states 
we operate through four strategic business units 
the commercial group  the largest business unit  owns  develops  acquires and operates regional malls  specialty urban retail centers  office buildings  hotels and mixed use projects 
new york city operations through our partnership with forest city ratner companies are part of the commercial group 
the residential group owns  develops  acquires and operates residential rental property  including upscale and middle market apartments  adaptive re use developments and supported living facilities 
real estate groups are the combined commercial and residential groups 
the land development group acquires and sells both land and developed lots to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
it also owns and develops land into master planned communities and mixed use projects 
the lumber trading group  a wholesaler  sells lumber to customers in all states and canadian provinces 
we have more than billion of assets in states and the district of columbia 
core markets include new york city  denver  boston  washington dc  philadelphia and california 
our corporate headquarters is in cleveland  ohio 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all majority owned subsidiaries where we have financial or operational control 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are subject to judgment and uncertainties 
we have used our best judgment to determine estimates of certain amounts included in the financial statements as a result of these policies  giving due consideration to materiality 
as a result of uncertainties surrounding these events at the time the estimates are made  actual results could differ from these estimates causing adjustments to be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that we believe contain uncertainties that are considered critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
our management reviews and discusses the policies below on a regular basis 
these policies have also been discussed with our audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves on notes receivable we record allowances for probable uncollectible rent receivables from commercial tenants based on an estimate of the amount of the receivables that will not be realized from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
this estimate is calculated based on a three year history of early tenant lease terminations as well as an estimate for expected activity of current tenants in the case of the straight line rent adjustments 
there is a risk that our estimate of the expected activity of current tenants may not accurately reflect future events 
if the estimate does not accurately reflect future tenant vacancies  the reserve for straight line rent receivable may be over or understated by the actual tenant vacancies that occur 
we estimate the allowance for notes receivable based on our assessment of the collectibility of the note 
our assessment of collectibility is based largely on expected future cash flows estimated to be paid to our limited partners 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows does not accurately reflect actual events  our reserve on notes receivable may be over or understated by the actual cash flows that occur 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at january   and was   and  respectively 
during the years ended january   and  we reduced reserves previously recorded on certain notes receivable at certain syndicated residential properties 
these reserves were reduced due to the occurrence of a series of events see note b on page 
in the course of evaluation of these events and their effect on the collectibility of the notes  we used estimates 
these estimates included  but were not limited to  estimated appraisal values as well as future cash flows at these properties 
these estimates can be affected by market conditions at the time that will not only affect the appraisal value but operating cash flow projections 
had different estimates been applied  the amount of the reserves reversed might have been different than the amounts actually recorded 
for the years ended january   and  we reduced reserves of   and  respectively 
economic lives depreciation and amortization is generally computed on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the estimated useful lives of buildings and first generation tenant allowances are primarily years 
subsequent tenant improvements are amortized over the life of the tenant s lease 
this estimate is based on the length of time the asset is expected to generate positive operating cash flows 
actual events and circumstances can cause the life of the building to be different than the estimates made 
additionally  lease terminations can affect the economic life of the tenant improvements 
we believe the estimated useful lives of fixed assets are reasonable and follow industry standards 
asset impairment we review our investment portfolio to determine if its carrying costs will be recovered from future cash flows whenever events or changes indicate that recoverability of long lived assets may not be assured 
in cases where we do not expect to recover our carrying costs  an impairment loss is recorded as a provision for decline in real estate for assets in our real estate portfolio pursuant to the guidance established in fasb no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as part of the analysis to determine if an impairment loss has occurred we are required to make estimates to determine future operating cash flows 
if different estimates are applied in determining future operating cash flows  such as occupancy rates and rent and expense increases  we may not record an impairment loss  or may record a greater impairment loss on a property 
allowance for projects under development the company records an allowance for development project write offs for its projects under development included in real estate  at cost on its consolidated balance sheets 
specific projects are written off against this allowance when it is determined by management that the project will not be developed 
the allowance is periodically adjusted based on the company s actual development project write off history 
these adjustments are recorded to operating expenses in the company s consolidated statements of earnings 
variable interest entities effective february   we plan to adopt fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
r 
under fin no 
r  we will be required to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if our interest in the vie is such that we will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
calculating expected losses and or expected residual returns involves estimating expected future cash flows 
if different estimates are applied in determining future cash flows  such as the probability of the future cash flows and the risk free rate  we may incorrectly conclude on the consolidation method of an entity 

table of contents results of operations we report our results of operations by each of our four strategic business units as well as our corporate activities as we believe this provides the most meaningful understanding of our financial performance 
overview we are a fully integrated real estate company principally engaged in the ownership  development  acquisition and management of commercial and residential real estate throughout the united states 
our portfolio includes interests in retail centers  apartment communities  office buildings and hotels 
we believe that our company benefits from our geographic focus and product diversity 
our products are focused in our core markets  which include new york city  denver  boston  washington  dc  philadelphia  and california 
these are growing urban markets with high barriers to entry where we have successfully gained access to large  complex commercial  residential and mixed use projects 
as a result of an ongoing effort to increase property concentration in the core markets  these markets now account for percent of our current portfolio 
we expect this concentration to increase as percent of the total projects opened or acquired during  and percent of the projects under construction as of the end of are in these markets 
during  we opened short pump town center in richmond  virginia  our first open air regional lifestyle center  worth street  our first rental apartment building in manhattan  and began to develop university of pennsylvania in philadelphia  our first biotechnology related development opportunity outside of the boston market 
other significant milestones occurring during included completing project openings and acquisitions  closing billion in mortgage financing transactions at attractive interest rates  being awarded the exclusive right to negotiate for the mixed use redevelopment of southeast federal center in washington  dc  announcing plans for brooklyn atlantic yards  a long term mixed use urban development project whose main attraction is expected to be a new sports and entertainment arena  being selected to negotiate for the rights to develop our first military families housing community in hawaii  and taking control of the new york times headquarters site 
in the second quarter of  we completed a million  senior note offering due in in february  we completed a million  senior note offering due in both offerings lowered the cost of our fixed rate corporate debt by approximately basis points and extended the average maturities of our corporate debentures to years 
additionally  in the first quarter of fiscal  we renegotiated our corporate credit facility 
the expansion to million represents a million increase in availability in our credit line 
the new facility matures in with annual renewal options 
all three of these transactions significantly improved our liquidity and long term financial flexibility 
even though consumer sentiment improved during  low job growth across our markets continues to affect both our commercial and residential businesses 
furthermore  the record low interest rates  which are spurring home sales and causing residential rental vacancies and rent rate reductions  continue to have a negative impact on our apartment business 
as a result  we believe any meaningful economic recovery is unlikely in the short term 
we are  therefore  cautiously optimistic as we move into we fully expect that will be just as challenging as at the same time  we have a track record of past successes and a strong pipeline of future opportunities which preserves our optimism 
we are clearly in a position of strength  with a balanced portfolio concentrated in the product types and geographic markets that offer many exciting  financially rewarding opportunities

discontinued operations we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective february  this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it also retains the basic provisions for presenting discontinued operations in the income statement but broadened the scope to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of business 
pursuant to the definition of a component of an entity in sfas no 
 assuming no significant continuing involvement  all earnings of properties which have been sold or held for sale are reported as discontinued operations 
we consider assets held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the transaction from closing 
in most transactions  these contingencies are not satisfied until the actual closing of the transaction  and  accordingly  the property is not identified as held for sale until the closing actually occurs 
however  each potential transaction is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances

the financing obligations of lumber trading are without recourse to us 
accordingly  the liquidity of lumber trading group is discussed separately below under lumber trading group liquidity 
mortgage financings our primary capital strategy seeks to isolate the financial risk at the property level to maximize returns on our equity capital 
all of our mortgage debt is nonrecourse including our construction loans 
we operate as a c corporation and retain substantially all of our internally generated cash flow 
we recycle this cash flow  together with refinancing and property sale proceeds to fund new development and acquisitions that drive favorable returns for our shareholders 
this strategy provides us with the necessary liquidity to take advantage of investment opportunities 
we are actively working to extend the maturities and or refinance the nonrecourse debt that is coming due in and  generally pursuing long term fixed rate debt for our stabilized properties 
during the year ended january   we completed the following financings purpose of financing in thousands refinancings development projects commitment acquisition loan extensions additional fundings reduction of mortgage debt due to property dispositions 
table of contents for maturing debt  we continue to seek long term debt for those project loans which mature within the next months as well as for those projects which will begin operation within the next months  generally pursuing fixed rate loans 
for construction loans  we generally pursue floating rate financings with maturities ranging from two to five years 
upon opening and achieving stabilized operations  we generally pursue long term fixed rate financing 
interest rate exposure at january   the composition of nonrecourse mortgage debt was as follows amount rate dollars in thousands fixed variable taxable tax exempt udag reflects weighted average interest rates including both the base index and lender margin 
taxable variable rate debt of  as of january  is protected with libor swaps and caps described below

these libor based hedges as of february  protect the debt currently outstanding as well as the anticipated increase in debt outstanding for projects under development or anticipated to be under development during the year ending january  outside of lender hedging requirements that require the borrower to protect against significant fluctuations to interest rates  we generally do not hedge tax exempt debt because  since  the base rate of this type of financing has averaged and has never exceeded 
as of january   we have  of tax exempt caps at a weighted average strike rate of that have maturities through january including properties accounted for under the equity method  a basis point increase in taxable interest rates would increase the annual pre tax interest cost for the next months of our taxable variable rate debt by approximately  at january  this increase is net of the protection provided by the interest rate swaps and long term contracts in place as of january  and contemplates the effects of floors on  of libor based debt 
a portion of our taxable variable rate debt is related to construction loans for which the interest expense is capitalized 
although tax exempt rates generally increase in an amount that is smaller than corresponding changes in taxable interest rates  a basis point increase in tax exempt rates would increase the annual pre tax interest cost for the next months of our tax exempt variable rate debt by approximately  at january

this securitization facility was repaid in full on october  using borrowing under the credit facility in place prior to october  and was not replaced 
to protect against risks associated with the variable interest rates on current and future borrowings on the revolving line of credit  the lumber trading group entered into an interest rate swap on october  with a notional amount of  the swap fixes the libor interest rate at and is effective through january  recourse of this credit facility is limited to certain assets of the lumber trading group

guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

we believe the risk of payment under these guarantees as described below is remote and  to date  no payments have been made under these guarantees 
as of january   we have guaranteed loans totaling  relating to a  bank loan for the sterling glen of ryebrook formerly stone gate at bellefair supported living residential group project in ryebrook  new york and our  share of a bond issue made by the village of woodridge  relating to a land development group project in suburban chicago  illinois 
these guarantees were entered into prior to january   and therefore  have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements at january   pursuant to the provisions of fin no 
the bank loan guaranty is expected to terminate in early the bond issue guarantee terminates april   unless the bonds are paid sooner  and is limited to  in any one year 
we also had outstanding letters of credit of  as of january  the maximum potential amount of future payments on the guaranteed loans and letters of credit we could be required to make is the total amounts noted above 
as a general partner for certain limited partnerships  we guaranteed the funding of operating deficits of newly opened apartment projects for an average of five years 
these guarantees were entered into prior to january   and therefore  have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements at january   pursuant to the provisions of fin no 

table of contents at january   the maximum potential amount of future payments on these operating deficit guarantees we could be required to make is approximately  we would seek to recover any amounts paid through refinancing or sales proceeds of the apartment project 
these partnerships typically require us to indemnify  on an after tax or grossed up basis  the investment partner against the failure to receive  or the loss of allocated tax credits and tax losses 
at january  the maximum potential payment under these tax indemnity guarantees was approximately  we believe that all necessary requirements for qualifications for such tax credits have been and will be met and that our investment partners will be able to receive expense allocations associated with the properties 
we have obtained legal opinions from major law firms supporting the validity of the tax credits 
we do not expect to make any payments under these guarantees 
our mortgage loans are all non recourse  however in some cases lenders carve out certain items from the non recourse provisions 
these carve out items enable the lenders to seek recourse if we or the joint venture commit fraud  voluntarily file for bankruptcy  intentionally misapply funds  transfer title without lender consent  or intentionally misrepresent facts 
we have also provided certain environmental guarantees 
under these environmental remediation guarantees  we must remediate any hazardous materials brought onto the property in violation of environmental laws 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is limited to the actual losses suffered or actual remediation costs incurred 
a portion of these carve outs and guarantees have been made on behalf of joint ventures and while the amount of the potential liability is currently indeterminable  we believe any liability would not exceed our partners share of the outstanding principal balance of the loans in which these carve outs and environmental guarantees have been made 
at january  the outstanding balance of the partners share of these loans was approximately  we believe the risk of payment on the carve out guarantees is mitigated in most cases by the fact we manage the property  and in the event our partner did violate one of the carve out items  we would seek recovery from our partner for any payments we would make 
additionally  we further mitigate our exposure through environmental insurance and insurance coverage for items such as fraud 
we guaranteed the principal and interest on  of municipal bonds issued in may by an unrelated third party in connection with our investment in the redevelopment of stapleton  a former airport in denver  colorado 
we have a ownership interest in stapleton which is fully consolidated in our financial statements 
the bonds bear interest at  require semi annual interest payments and mature on december  in addition  we plan to provide a similar guarantee relating to an additional  in municipal bonds expected to be drawn in the next eighteen months depending upon the status of the development at stapleton 
we have assessed this obligation pursuant to the provisions of fin no 
and have determined the value of the guarantee to be approximately  this amount has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at january  we customarily guarantee lien free completion of projects under construction 
upon completion  the guarantees are released 
at january   we have guaranteed completion of construction of development projects with a total cost of  which are approximately complete in the aggregate 
the projects have total loan commitments of  of which approximately  was outstanding at january  to date  our subsidiaries have been successful in consistently delivering lien free completion of construction projects  without calling our guarantees of completion 
we are also involved in certain claims and litigation related to our operations

fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb published a revision to the interpretation fin no 
r to clarify some of the provisions of fin no 
and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie are to be included in the consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds a variable interest in an entity will consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin no 
also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation became effective upon issuance 
the consolidation requirements of this interpretation apply immediately to vie s created after january  and no later than the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  for public companies with non special purpose entities that were created prior to february  we will implement fin no 
r on february  as a result of the implementation of fin no 
r  properties residential  three commercial  and two land currently accounted for on the equity method of accounting will switch to full consolidation 
seven properties one commercial and six residential currently accounted for on the cost method will switch to full consolidation 
five residential properties will be deconsolidated 
if fin no 
r would have been implemented by january   total assets and total liabilities would have increased approximately  upon adoption we of fin no 
r expect to record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle adjustment of approximately  pre tax which will reduce net earnings and shareholders equity 
we believe our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our investment with these vie s is limited to the value of our investment in these vie s

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
the minority interests associated with certain of our consolidated joint ventures that have finite lives under the terms of the agreements represent mandatorily redeemable interests as defined in sfas no 
on november   the fasb indefinitely deferred the effective date of paragraphs nine and ten of sfas no 
as they apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests in order to address a number of interpretation and implementation issues 
however  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are still required 
although no such obligation exists  if we were to dissolve the entities or sell the underlying real estate assets and satisfy any outstanding obligations  in all of our consolidated finite life entities as of january   the estimated aggregate settlement value of these noncontrolling interests would approximate book value due to our preferred returns upon settlement 
our assessment of the settlement value is based on the estimated liquidation values of the assets and liabilities and the resulting proceeds that we would distribute to our noncontrolling interests  as required under the terms of the respective agreements 
while additional guidance from the fasb relating to noncontrolling interests in consolidated finite life partnerships is pending  we do not expect the remainder of this statement to have an immediate material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

outside of lender hedging requirements that require the borrower to protect against significant fluctuations to interest rates  we generally do not hedge tax exempt debt because  since  the base rate of this type of financing has averaged and has never exceeded 
as of january   we have  of tax exempt caps at a weighted average strike rate of that have maturities through january we estimate the fair value of our debt instruments by discounting future cash payments at interest rates that approximate the current market 
based on these parameters  the carrying amount of our total fixed rate debt at january  was  compared to an estimated fair value of  we estimate that a basis point decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of this fixed rate debt to approximately  at january  we estimate the fair value of our hedging instruments based on interest rate market pricing models
