executive summary we have insufficient short term resources for the payment of our current liabilities 
various creditors have contacted us in order to demand payment for outstanding liabilities owed to them and two creditors  cit technologies corporation and jabil circuit  inc  have commenced legal proceedings against the company seeking approximately million in damages 
we are in active discussions with our significant creditors in order to restructure our outstanding liabilities and we are attempting to resolve the outstanding legal actions brought against us 
for a detailed description of the company s ongoing litigation and settlement agreements with its creditors  see part i item  legal proceedings 
in order to alleviate our working capital shortfall  we are attempting to raise additional f inancing 
since february  we have raised approximately million from optel  llc and optel capital  llc  entities controlled by our majority stockholder and current chairman of the board of directors  dr 
bryan j 
zwan collectively optel  pursuant to several secured promissory notes the optel notes as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements related party transactions of which approximately million is currently outstanding 
the optel notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  mature on july   unless certain specified events occur accelerating their maturity  and are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the company pursuant to a separate security agreement between optel and the company 
optel has notified us that it intends to continue to consider the company s requests for funding and to make a dvances to the company during the second quarter of on terms substantially similar to the loans made by optel to the company during the past six months 
as of the date of this report  we are unaware of any funding source other than optel that would be willing to provide future financing to us prior to the restructuring of our liabilities 
in addition  as of the date of this report  we have entered into settlement agreements with several of our creditors settling approximately million of debt and claims for approximately million 
as a result  we have recognized the impact of these savings in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended december  however  we have been unable to restructure our outstanding liabilities with remaining certain significant creditors 
during  our industry continued to experience an economic downturn that was brought on by a significant decrease in network build outs and capital spending by the telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers in our customers declining business resulted in a significant decrease in sales of our products 
while we do see some recovery in the telecommunications sector  we anticipate the recovery of the fiber optic test equipment market will occur slowly 
was a year of continued restructuring of our company as we continued to rescale our business in response to the current market environment 
during  we reduced our workforce by employees 
we focused on controlling expenses by reducing operating expenses in all areas 
engineering and development was reduced in from levels 
selling and marketing expenses were reduced  and general and administrative expenditures were reduced in compared to levels 
in spite of the reduction in operating expenses  we continued to incur net operating losses that started in the third quarter of the company can give no assurance as to whether its revenues will return to previous levels  when it will generate positive cash flows from operations  when it will return to profitability  whether we will be able to avoid bankruptcy protection or whether we will be able to continue as a going concern 
overview digital lightwave  inc provides the global fiber optic communications industry with products and technology used to develop  install  maintain  monitor and manage fiber optic based networks 
telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers deploy the company s products to provide quality assurance and ensure optimum performance of advanced optical communications networks and network equipment 
the company s products are sold worldwide to leading and emerging telecommunications service providers  telecommunications equipment manufacturers  equipment leasing companies and international distributors 
the company s net sales are generated from sales of its products less an estimate for customer returns 
we expect that the average selling price of our products will fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including market demand  product configuration  potential volume discounts to customers  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements and the introduction of competitive products 
because the cost of goods sold tends to remain relatively stable for any given product  fluctuations in the average selling price may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of our products have tended to be concentrated with a few major customers and we expect sales will continue to be concentrated with a few major customers in the future 
for the year ended december   two customers  control concepts and delo  collectively accounted for approximately of our sales 
for the year ended december   one customer  technology rental services  accounted for approximately of total sales 
the company is in litigation with cit technologies corporation  an affiliate of technology rental services  which is expected to have an adverse effect on future sales to this customer 
see item  legal proceedings 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when selling through a distributor to an end user customer  we either obtain an end user purchase order documenting the order placed with the distributor or proof of delivery to the end user as evidence that a sales arrangement exists 
no revenue is recognized on products shipped on a trial basis 
we believe t hat our accrued warranty reserve is sufficient to meet our responsibilities for potential future warranty work on products sold 
the company has not entered into long term agreements or blanket purchase orders for the sale of its products 
it generally obtains purchase orders for immediate shipment 
the company does not expect to carry substantial backlog from quarter to quarter in the future 
our sales during a particular quarter are highly dependent upon orders placed by customers during that quarter 
most of our operating expenses are fixed and cannot be easily reduced in response to decreased revenues 
variations in the timing of revenues could cause significant variations in results of operations from quarter to quarter and result in continuing quarterly losses 
the deferral of any large order from one quarter to another w ould negatively affect the results of operations for the earlier quarter 
the company must obtain orders during each quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve revenue and profit objectives 
in order to maintain our market share  we are focused on maintaining technological leadership with our product lines 
we have evaluated our sales efforts to identify opportunities where our account presence can be improved and are working to exploit those opportunities 
subject to resolution of our working capital constraints  we are seeking new applications for our installed product base to be realized with use of new modular add ons and enhancements 
during  we established offices in australia  taiwan  india  singapore  brazil and china 
subsequently  the offices in australia  brazil  taiwan  india and singapore were closed and we intend to utilize independent distributors for future sales in such regions 
we currently have approximately five international sales and support representat ives across europe and china 
we also established channel partners such as independent sales representatives and distributors to complement our sales force 
we are concentrating on the products and technologies that we believe are most important to our customers 
subject to resolution of our working capital constraints  we plan to introduce enhancements to our product lines to meet growing international needs and global high speed data service requirements 
in  we added three new products to our nic product line  and introduced four new significant product enhancements 
during the fourth quarter of  we acquired certain assets related to the optical wavelength management product line the owm line of lightchip  inc  a salem  nh based provider of components and subsystems for optical networks 
we plan to complement the owm line of remote wavelength management solutions for dwdm systems with our own network access agent naa product line for centralized network testing and monitoring 
on november  we acquired certain assets related to the optical test system product line of tektronix the ots line 
revenues for the ots line have been minimal and  since the acquisition  we have terminated all but seven former employees of tektronix  hired in connection with the acquisition 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the resources or personnel necessary to generate revenues from the acquired product lines 
we believe that these new products and product enhancements  strategic partnerships  and third party distribution agreements will further complement our product portfolio and enable us to offer a broader range of products to our global customers 
critical accounting estimates we believe that estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities are critical in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results and they require difficult  subject and complex judgments that are often the results of estimates that are inherently uncertain 
specifically  we believe the following estimates to be critical sales returns and other allowances  reserve for uncollectible accounts  reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  warranty  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation 
we make significant judgments and estimates and assumptions in connection with establishing the above mentioned valuation allowances 
if we made different judgments or used different estimates or assumptions for establishing such amounts  it is likely that the amount and timing of our revenue or operating expenses for any period would be materially different 
we estimate the amount of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products to evaluate the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
our estimate for the provision for sales returns and other allowances as of december  was million 
we also estimate the collectability of our accounts receivables 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for uncollectible accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of our estimated reserve for uncollectible accounts of million 
we estimate the amount of excess and obsolete inventory 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing current and expected sales trends  the amount of current parts on hand  the current market value of parts on hand and the viability and technical obsolescence of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the assumptions made relative to expected sales trends are subjective in nature and have a material impact on the estimate of the reserve requirement 
should future sales trends  in total or by product line  fluctuate from that used in our estimates  this reserve could be overstated or understated 
our inventory balance was million as of december   net of our estimated reserve for excess and obsole te inventory of million 
we estimate the impairment of long lived assets 
we monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
these events and circumstances include decrease in market price of a long lived asset  change in the manner in which a long lived asset is used  changes in legal factors and a current period operating loss or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating losses or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of long lived assets 
when such an event or changes in circumstance occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we recognize an impairment when there is an excess of the assets carrying value over the fair value as estimated using a discounted expected future cash flows model 
in estimating undiscounted expected future cash flows  we must make judgments and estimates related to future sales and profitability 
should future sales trends or profitability be significantly less than that forecasted  our impairment could be understated 
we could be required to take an additional impairment charge in the future should our actual cash flows be less than forecasted 
for the years ended december  and  our impairment of long lived assets was million and million  respectively 
we estimate the amount of our warranty liability reserve 
we consider many factors when making our estimate  including historical trends  the number of products under warranty  the costs of replacement parts and the expected reliability of our products 
we believe that our accrued warranty reserve is sufficient to meet our responsibilities for potential future warranty work on products sold 
our accrued warranty liability as of december  was approximately million 
we estimate the amount of liability the company may incur as a result of pending litigation 
our estimate of legal liability is uncertain and is based on the size of the outstanding claims and an assessment of the merits of the claims 
we have accrued million for liability resulting from pending litigation as of december  see item legal proceedings for information about certain legal proceedings 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit loss operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges litigation charge impairment of property and equipment total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other income expense  net income loss before income taxes net income loss represents less than of net sales

international sales for the year ended december   as a percentage of total sales  decreased from to of total sales 
international sales decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of goods sold was due to the reduction in the volume of units sold as well as a reduction in charges related to excess and obsolete inventory 
during  charges for excess and obsolete inventory totaled million as compared to million in such charges recorded during these reductions in cost of goods sold were offset in part by the million write off of inventory claims for inventory held at jabil circuits 
for further discussion see item  legal proceedings 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  improved from a loss of million for the year ended december  to a loss of million for the year ended december  gross profit for the years ended december  and  excluding the charges related to excess and obsolete inventory and the write off of inventory claims held at jabil circuit  were million and million  respectively 
gross margins for the years ended december  and  excluding the charges related to excess and obsolete inventory and the write off of inventory claims  were approximately and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin year over year is attributed to a favorable shift in product mix offset in part by the decrease in the average selling price of the nic prod uct line

as of the date of this report  we have entered into settlement agreements with several of our creditors settling approximately million of debt and claims for approximately million 
the company s ability to meet cash requirements over the next twelve months is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital from optel or raise additional capital from other sources  resolve outstanding legal actions brought against us  successfully negotiate extended payment terms with certain vendors and attain forecasted sales objectives

these were partially offset by non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of million  provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million  provision for uncollectible accounts of million  an impairment of property and equipment of million  and restructuring charges of million 
the increases in accounts payable of million and litigation charges of million also contributed to offset the cash used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable of million  increases in accrued litigation charges of million  non cash expenses consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of million  provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million and provision for uncollectible accounts of million

million repayment of the trendium note receivable  the 
million reduction in our restricted cash requirements  and the sale and maturity of unrestricted short term investments totaling million

million

legal proceedings the company is subject to ongoing litigation for amounts owed to certain of its creditors and has entered into settlement agreements with certain other creditors 
while the company continues to attempt to resolve its outstanding litigation on terms favorable to the company  and to make the payments required under its settlement agreements  the company currently has insufficient resources for the payment of its outstanding liabilities owed to such creditors 
although optel has notified the company that it intends to continue to consider the company s requests for further funding and to make advances to the company through the second quarter of  the company has not received a commitment from optel specifying the amount of funds that optel is willing to provide to the company
