critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements included as part of this document 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases these estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

back to contents the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note to the attached consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgement by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from these estimates 
these judgements are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include product warranty in the ordinary course of business  the company warrants its products against defect in design  materials  and workmanship over various time periods 
warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is established based upon management s best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is not significant to the financial position of the company for all periods presented 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the last in first out basis for a majority of us inventories and the first in first out method for all remaining inventories 
the company has recorded a reserve for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the realizable value of long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  relying on a number of factors including operating results  budgets  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
the company s past business acquisitions resulted in the recognition of goodwill  which may result in future impairment expenses 
the company s other intangible assets which primarily consist of product application software  affects the amount of future period amortization expense 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements issued by the securities and exchange commission 
revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company establishes allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts  sales discounts  product warranty  and returns based upon historical experience 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included as a component of net sales 
postretirement benefit obligation the company  in consultation with an actuarial firm specializing in the valuation of postretirement benefit obligations  selects certain actuarial assumptions to base the actuarial valuation of such obligations on  such as the discount rate interest rate used to determine present value of obligations payable in the future  initial health care cost trend rate  the ultimate cost care trend rate  and mortality tables to determine the expected future mortality of plan participants 
to the extent that the actual rates and mortality vary from the assumptions used to determine the present actuarial valuation of these postretirement benefits  additional provision for expense may be necessary 
income taxes under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company has not recognized any income tax benefit related to the income tax losses incurred by its mexican subsidiary currently because there is uncertainty as to whether that subsidiary will realize those benefits in the future 
as the mexican subsidiary realizes these income tax benefits in the future  a reduction of income taxes will be recognized 
management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  which  if actual experience varies  could result in material adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities 

back to contents liquidity and capital resources the company s contractual obligations as of january  are as follows contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations    capitalized lease obligations operating lease obligations     purchase obligations   postretirement benefit obligations  total      includes only the accumulated benefit obligation at january  and excludes the unamortized prior service benefit and unrecognized actuarial net gain that will be recognized as non cash credits in future years 
at january  current and long term debt totaled million  compared to million at december   and was comprised of million in revolving term debt under the facility  million in tax exempt revenue bonds  million of a foreign revolving credit facility and million of other long term financing 
the company s effective borrowing rate is approximately 
borrowings are subject to the satisfaction of certain financial covenants 
in february  the company amended its united states revolving credit facility the facility  which included an extension of the maturity date to january  that has enabled the company to reflect amounts owed as a long term obligation 
the amendment provided the company additional flexibility under certain of the financial covenants  granted the lenders security over substantially all of the company s united states assets  and reduced the maximum amount of the facility from million to million 
this facility provides significant financial support for the operating activities of the company 
the reduction in the facility better reflects the company s working capital needs over the remaining term of the agreement 
after taking into consideration million of outstanding standby letters of credit relating to collateral for industrial revenue bonds and long term workers compensation risk exposures  and financial covenant limitations the company had approximately million of available borrowing capacity under the facility at january  management expects to continue discussions with its current lenders and other sources of debt financing to secure long term financing commitments beyond january this could lead to additional assets  principally located at the company s foreign operations  being pledged as well as higher borrowing costs 
the company generated net cash flow of in fiscal compared to a use of cash in fiscal the company has generated positive cash flows from operations in each of the last five years 
during  the company generated  cash from operating activities  which compares to  for the same period in the prior year 
the primary reason for this fluctuation  approximately million  was the company s decision in the third quarter of to build inventories to accommodate anticipated demand while in the same period a year earlier the company was continuing to reduce inventories as a result of the sustained slump in manufacturing demand 
the company s working capital at january  as compared to december  was significantly higher primarily due to the classification of the million unsecured united states revolving credit obligation at january  as long term debt because of its extended maturity date of january by comparison at december   million of the facility was classified as a short term liability because of its maturity date of october in addition  the increase in inventories and changes in other current assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses increased working capital by approximately million 
the company used  and for investing and financing activities  respectively  during the year ended january  this compares to cash used of  and  for the same activities in the prior year 
the major difference in investing activities was that the spending included  for the acquisition of a minority interest  and the company has reduced capital spending by  in the changes in financing activities have been caused by the company being more dependent upon its revolving credit facility in primarily to fund increases in inventory 
the company believes that the combination of cash generated by operations  available borrowing capacity  and the company s ability to obtain additional long term indebtedness  based upon the current state of the secured lending market  is adequate to finance the company s operations for the foreseeable future 

back to contents capital expenditures for fiscal years   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
during the last three years  the company s capital investments have been at maintenance levels to support new product introductions  improve product quality  and reduce operating costs 
it is expected that future capital expenditures will more closely approximate levels 
the amount of commitments for capital expenditures at january  was not significant 
the company paid million in dividends during  million in  and million in the company declared a dividend million on january  and paid it on january  the company s ongoing ability to declare and pay dividends is ultimately dependent upon its ability to operate at profitable levels  and demonstrate compliance with its revolving credit agreement

the act expands medicare  primarily by adding a prescription drug benefit for medicare eligibles starting in the act provides employers currently sponsoring prescription drug programs for medicare eligibles with a range of options for coordinating with the new government sponsored program to potentially reduce program cost 
the fsp concludes that companies will be permitted to recognize that amount for year end financial statements pursuant to fas or to delay having to report the effects of the act until remaining questions are resolved 
the impact of the act on the company s accumulated post retirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost has not been determined 
pursuant to guidance from the fasb under fsp fas  the company has chosen to defer recognition of the potential effects of the act for disclosure 
when issued  the authoritative guidance on the accounting for the subsidy will address transition 
in december  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
revised employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
 and effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company has adopted this statement and the additional disclosures required for its postretirement benefit plans are set forth in footnote benefit plans postretirement benefits  however  disclosure of estimated future benefit payments is effective for fiscal years ending after june  safe harbor statement certain information included or incorporated by reference in this document may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  that address activities  events or developments that the company intends  expects  projects  believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward looking statements

back to contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential change in an asset s or financial instrument s value caused  for example  by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate and unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and each of the mexican peso  canadian dollar  euro  and indian rupee 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
the company s financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
exchange rate sensitivity the company has operations in several foreign countries  and approximately million of the company s revenue from continuing operations was derived from the company s operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
the company has not used foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates except with regard to the canadian dollar 
at january  the company had outstanding forward purchase contracts to buy us dollars using canadian dollars totaling million that caused the company to recognize a million loss on these contracts in the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between company subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
the company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported net loss by approximately million 
interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate payable on the company s facility is influenced by the company s operating performance and degree of leverage  as well as by actions of the federal reserve bank board in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate that underlies the cost of funds borrowed by the company 
during and the federal reserve implemented a number of reductions in the federal funds interest rate in an effort to stimulate the us economy 
as a result the effective interest rate that the company paid on its borrowings under the facility declined leading to a corresponding reduction in interest expense 
to the extent that the federal reserve increases the federal funds interest rate in the future  the effective interest rate on the company s facility will increase  and the company s interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant 
due to the continuing economic recession and operating performance of the company  as part of recent amendments to its facility  the company agreed to a one half of one percent increase in the base rate that it will pay on borrowed funds under the facility effective january based on the balance outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility at january   a change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by million
