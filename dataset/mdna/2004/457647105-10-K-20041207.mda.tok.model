item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under business risks related to our businesss and elsewhere in this report 
we utilize a fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest to september for clarity of presentation  we have described all periods as if they end at the end of the calendar quarter 
overview we are a leading worldwide provider of flexible circuit interconnect solutions to original equipment manufacturers oems  in the electronics industry 
we offer a full range of customized flexible circuit applications and services from initial design  development and prototype to fabrication  assembly and test on a global basis 
we target high volume markets where miniaturization  form and weight are driving factors and flexible circuits are an enabling technology 
applications for flexible circuits currently addressed by us include data storage devices such as hard disk drives hdds  flat panel displays fpd including liquid crystal displays lcds for mobile communication devices and large format plasma screens  tape drives and printers 
our customers include m  dell  hitachi  hp  maxtor  medtronic  philips  quantum  sae magnetics a subsidiary of tdk  samsung  seagate  staktek  storagetek  xerox and other leading electronic oems 
net sales and revenue recognition we manufacture flexible circuits and perform certain additional assembly and test functions on these flexible circuits based on customer specifications 
we sell our products direct throughout the world  primarily in north america  europe and the pacific rim countries 
we use non exclusive sales representatives to augment our direct sales efforts  with sales through distributors representing less than of our total net sales for fiscal years  and we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment or delivery of our product to our customers  depending on the customer agreement or shipping terms 
we store some inventory in third party owned warehouses that are located close to customers manufacturing facilities 
sales from third party warehouses are recognized upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgment of the receipt of the goods 
costs and expenses cost of sales consists primarily of material costs for raw materials and semi finished components used for assembly of our products  labor costs directly related to manufacture  assembly and inspection of our products  costs of general utilities  production supplies and chemicals consumed in the manufacturing processes  costs related to the maintenance of our manufacturing equipment and facilities  costs related to material and product handling and shipment  depreciation costs related to facilities  machinery and equipment used to manufacture  assemble and inspect our products  and salaries and overhead attributed to our supply chain  process engineering and manufacturing personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and related selling commissions  travel  business development and program management  administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel expenses  other significant expenses related to external accounting  software maintenance and legal and regulatory fees  and overhead attributed to our selling  general and administrative personnel 
engineering expenses include costs associated with the design  development and testing of our products and processes 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and related development personnel expenses  overhead attributed to our development and test engineering personnel  and prototyping costs related to the development of new products 
restructuring charges are those costs primarily related to manufacturing facility closures  severance and product discontinuations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced the planned closure of our maple plain facility and the plan to discontinue the support of the fsa attachment process 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges related to closing our chandler  arizona facility and transferring manufacturing operations to our minnesota and thailand locations 
because we initially underestimated the costs relating to this restructuring  we recorded additional restructuring charges in fiscal and as of march   the restructuring related to the closing of the chandler facility was substantially complete 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated for the years ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative engineering restructuring total operating expenses income loss from operations net interest and other expense income loss before provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and net sales our net sales were million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of 
this increase was the result of higher sales generated by disk drive  semiconductor packaging and flat panel display fpd applications being partially offset by decreases in revenue from non strategic consumer product lines 
the increased disk drive sales were related to our improved actuator flex afc market share as additional afc programs entered production 
semiconductor packaging net sales increased due to higher demand from our stacked memory customers in early fiscal the fpd sales improvement was related to new fpd programs beginning to ramp late in the fiscal year 
sales from the disk drive industry generated of our net sales for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september   sales from semiconductor packaging applications were compared to  fpd application net sales were versus  network system application sales were compared to and sales from other industry applications were for the year ended september  versus for the year ended september  we expect net sales for fiscal to improve as we continue to benefit from a significant number of new fpd program qualifications entering production and additional program and customer qualifications for our disk drive afc products 
this anticipated increase should more than offset an expected decrease in net sales from fsa products as our fsa customer transitions to an alternative technology for a portion of their next generation programs 
gross profit our gross profit was million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  decreased to  compared to for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in gross margin was primarily related to a higher fixed cost structure put in place to meet higher expected demand for afc and fpd products 
revenue from afc and fpd products was lower than expected due to inventory corrections in the disk drive industry and a customer delay of the production ramp up of new fpd programs resulting in higher than expected unabsorbed overhead expenses 
we anticipate that gross margins in fiscal will improve as net sales are expected to increase which will result in better utilization of our fixed cost structure 
the improved utilization should more than offset the impact of an expected increase in the material content of cost of goods sold due to anticipated higher levels of assembly related net sales 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  virtually unchanged as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to fiscal  increased fiscal spending for sarbanes oxley related consulting and higher payroll costs were offset by lower depreciation costs and training costs related to implementation of the company wide six sigma program during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal are expected to decrease as a percentage of net sales due to payroll cost reductions made as part of the june restructuring and anticipated increased net sales in fiscal engineering engineering expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
the increase in fiscal engineering expenses was primarily due to increased spending on qualifying products and processes for new applications including flat panel displays and inkjet printers and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering expenses were of sales for both the fiscal year ended september  and engineering expenses for fiscal are expected to decrease as a percentage of net sales due to an expected increase in sales while engineering expenses are expected to remain flat 
restructuring during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced the planned closure of our maple plain facility and the plan to discontinue the support of the fsa attachment process 
related to this restructuring  we recorded asset impairment charges of million and restructuring charges of million during the last two quarters of fiscal the assets that were impaired included the maple plain facility and related equipment and equipment used in the fsa attachment process 
the fair value of these assets was determined using quoted market prices where available  appraised values or estimated future cash flows where more definitive values were not available 
in order to reduce our cost structure  we plan to close our maple plain facility and consolidate its operations with our lamphun  thailand and litchfield  minnesota facilities 
in addition  we plan to discontinue supporting the fsa attachment process in order to utilize our resources in other areas with higher expected returns 
excluding asset impairment charges  restructuring charges are expected to be approximately million 
the million is expected to be comprised of million for one time termination benefits  million for contract termination costs and million for other moving and closing costs associated with the consolidation of the maple plain location with our other locations 
restructuring charges of million were recorded in the last two quarters of fiscal these charges were comprised of  for one time termination benefits   related to contract termination costs and  related to moving and closing costs 
the remaining charges are expected to be incurred in fiscal restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended september  were  in fiscal  the charges were recorded due to an increase in the estimate of the leased chandler  arizona facility disposition costs  primarily to buy out the remainder of the chandler  arizona facility lease through its june termination 
as of september   the restructuring was substantially complete 
net interest and other expense net interest expenses were million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
interest expense decreased in primarily due to average interest bearing debt being million lower for the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  net other income was  in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to net other expense of  in the fiscal year ended september  the increase was the result of foreign currency exchange gains being incurred in fiscal while a foreign currency exchange loss was generated in fiscal and the write off of loan origination fees related to the us based credit facility that was paid off in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended september  was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  the tax benefit for fiscal was calculated at a rate lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the exclusion of income generated from our foreign operating corporation and the exclusion of restructuring charges 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the tax benefit in the future 
comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and net sales our net sales were million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of 
this increase was due to higher sales generated by disk drive  semiconductor packaging and fpd applications 
the increased disk drive sales were related to our improved fsa market share as our largest customer in the disk drive industry transitioned to the gigabyte gb per platter technology platform 
semiconductor packaging net sales increased due to higher demand from our stacked memory customers 
the fpd sales improvement was related to the continued ramp up of the new fpd program announced during the first quarter of fiscal sales from the disk drive industry generated of our net sales for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september   sales from semiconductor packaging applications were  compared to  network system application sales were for both years  fpd net sales were versus  consumer application sales were versus and sales from other industry applications were for the year ended september  versus for the year ended september  gross profit our gross profit was million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  increased to  compared to for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher net sales increasing our fixed cost leverage and efficiency improvements related to six sigma and other initiatives 
these improvements offset the incremental start up and tooling costs related to new product introductions and product mix changes resulting from a lower portion of sales from hif  one of our older products  within our product mix that impacted the first half of fiscal we experienced a significant product transition during the second quarter of fiscal  converting approximately of our products to new designs 
the product mix for the first half of fiscal also had an increased share of fsa sales with higher material pass through content related to the suspension material used in the fsa product 
the fiscal product mix included a higher share of our hif product  which does not include the suspension related pass through material 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  compared to million in the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for both the fiscal year ended september  and the increase in fiscal spending was primarily due to increased commissions and royalties resulting from the increase in net sales  consulting and training costs related to implementation of the company wide six sigma program and severance costs of approximately  recorded during the first quarter of fiscal related to efforts to increase operational efficiency by consolidating from four marketing groups to three 
engineering engineering expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
the increase in fiscal engineering expenses was primarily due to increased spending on new product development  further spending related to fsa and fgsa technology improvements  qualifying products and processes for new applications including fpd displays  printers  semiconductor packaging substrates and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering expenses were of sales for both the fiscal year ended september  and restructuring restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended september  were  compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  in fiscal  the charges were recorded due to an increase in the estimate of the leased chandler  arizona facility disposition costs  primarily to buy out the remainder of the chandler  arizona facility lease through its june termination 
in the fiscal year ended september   additional charges were also recorded due to an increase in the estimate of the leased chandler  arizona facility disposition costs and an additional accrual was recorded to complete the restructuring related to the closing of our mexican facility 
as of september   the restructuring was substantially complete 
net interest and other expense net interest expenses were million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
interest expense decreased in primarily due to average interest bearing debt being million lower for the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  net other expense was  in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to net other income of  in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was the result of foreign currency exchange losses being incurred in fiscal while a foreign currency exchange gain was generated in fiscal and the write off of the loan origination fees related to the us based credit facility which was paid off in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended september  was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the tax benefit in the future 
during the second quarter of fiscal  approximately million of the tax benefit recorded was due to a reduction of the deferred tax allowance 
the deferred tax allowance was reduced as a result of the estimated improvement in deferred tax asset recoverability in light of the receipt of a million tax refund resulting from the carry back of the fiscal net operating loss 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  estimates are evaluated based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories  which are composed of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  our cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly different than the established reserves  a revision to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
goodwill 
we have determined goodwill relates to one reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
if events or circumstances change  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by operations  goodwill could become impaired and result in a charge to earnings 
deferred taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is set up where the realization of any deferred taxes becomes less likely than not to occur 
we analyze the valuation allowance periodically which may result in income tax expense being different than statutory rates 
revenue recognition 
we make electronic components flexible circuits based on customer specifications 
our revenue recognition policy is consistently applied regardless of sales channels utilized and product destination 
we have an implied warranty that the products meet our customers specification 
credits only are issued for customer returns 
in recognizing revenue in any period  we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  a binding purchase order is used as evidence of an arrangement 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment or delivery of our products to our customers  depending upon the customer agreement or shipping terms 
we also store inventory in warehouses jit hubs third party owned warehouses that are located close to our customers manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from jit hubs upon the transfer of title and risk of loss which follows our customers acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash from operating activities  sales of equity securities  bank credit facilities and employee stock option exercises 
cash and equivalents were million at september  and million at september  net cash used by operating activities was  in the fiscal year ended september   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the fiscal year ended september  for fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was the result of increases in accounts receivable  inventory and other assets more than offsetting increased accounts payable and the net of the pretax loss and non cash charges for restructuring and depreciation 
accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable all increased as a result of the fpd program ramp ups beginning near the end of fiscal for the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to non cash charges for restructuring and depreciation more than offsetting the pre tax loss for the period and the increase in accounts receivable at september  from september  as a result of the increased level of sales at the end of september  net cash provided by operating activities was also benefited from an increase in accounts payable for the same period as a result of the increased manufacturing activity levels and by decreases in inventory and the receipt of a tax refund 
a decrease in accrued liabilities resulting from the payment of accrued restructuring charges during the period reduced the net cash provided by operating activities 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the receipt of a million tax refund and non cash charges for depreciation and deferred tax benefits more than offsetting the net loss for the period 
net cash provided by operating activities was also benefited by decreases in inventory and accounts receivable more than offsetting a decrease in accounts payable for the period 
a decrease in accrued liabilities resulting from the payment of accrued restructuring charges during the period significantly reduced the net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal net cash used in investing activity was the result of capital expenditures including capacity increases for selected processes related to the expected increase in fpd and afc sales  new equipment to support the next fsa generation product  thailand capability expansion and upgrades of current capabilities 
in the fiscal year ended september   net cash used in investing activities was attributed to the purchase of test equipment and equipment to expand capacity in selected areas 
fiscal net cash used in investing activities was due to capital expenditures of million being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our mexican facility 
fiscal capital expenditures primarily included technological upgrades  selected capacity increases and facility improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal and net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from our new thailand long and short term credit facilities more than offsetting scheduled payments made under our existing credit facilities 
during the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of net proceeds from a follow on stock offering of million partially offset by the pay down of interest bearing debt 
fiscal net cash used by financing activities was due to reductions in the outstanding balances under our thailand packing credit facilities  scheduled payments under our us and thailand long term credit facilities and an additional million payment made under our us long term credit facility 
in june  we entered into a new credit facility with bank of ayudhya public company limited bay and the industrial finance corporation of thailand ifct which expanded the existing credit facility with these banks 
the long term facilities were increased by  million baht  the packing credit was increased by million baht and the short term working capital facility was increased by million baht 
the facility is now comprised of a million baht long term facility  a million baht long term facility  a million baht long term facility  a million baht facility  packing credit facilities totaling  million baht  short term working capital facilities totaling million baht and a million baht overdraft facility 
the thailand facilities are secured by certain receivables  inventory and assets held by us in thailand 
as of september   approximately million was outstanding under the thailand credit facilities 
total unused availability under the thailand credit facilities as of september  was approximately million  of which million was related to the packing credit and working capital facilities and million was available under the long term facilities to fund capital equipment expansions in thailand 
we believe that with the existing thailand credit facilities  cash generated from operations and the proceeds from a secondary offering of our common stock received on august   we will have adequate funds to support projected working capital and capital expenditures for the next twenty four months 
we are considering alternatives for generating additional working capital and long term financing and will continue to pursue financing opportunities to better leverage our assets 
our financing needs and the financing alternatives available to us are subject to change depending on  among other things  general economic and market conditions  changes in industry buying patterns  customer acceptance of our fsa  afc  stacked memory flex and fpd flex products and cash flow from operations 
contractual obligations the table below discloses a summary of the company s specified contractual obligations at september  in thousands under year to years to years after years total long term debt obligations operating leases total recent accounting pronouncements there have been no accounting pronouncements relevant to us since the end of fiscal forward looking statements statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  elsewhere in this report and in future filings by the company with the sec  except for the historical information contained herein and therein  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties are set forth under business risks related to our business in this annual report and include the timely availability and acceptance of new products including the fpd flexible circuits  next generation products for disk drive and semiconductor packaging substrate applications  the impact of competitive products and pricing  interruptions in the operations of the company s single source suppliers  changes in manufacturing efficiencies and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s revenue is generated from the disk drive  semiconductor packaging substrates  consumer electronics and data storage industries and the global economic downturn has had and continued economic softness will continue to have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while we transact business predominately in us dollars a portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect our cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses 
to reduce the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations  we enter into short term forward foreign currency exchange contracts in the regular course of business to manage our risk exposure  not as speculative instruments 
typically  these contracts have maturities of months or less 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange thailand baht for us dollars or us dollars for thailand baht at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
these contracts are not designated as hedges  therefore  the gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in income 
we periodically review the outlook for expected currency exchange rate movements as well as the policy on desired future foreign currency cash flow positions long  short or balanced for those currencies in which we have significant activity 
expected future cash flow positions and strategies are continuously monitored 
at september   we had open forward exchange contracts to buy thailand baht maturing december and  with notional amounts totaling  thailand baht approximately million us dollars 
no assurance can be given that our strategies will prevent future currency fluctuations from adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a large portion of our interest bearing debt is subject to interest rates which fluctuate with changes in market interest rates or are periodically reset based on market interest rates 
a large change in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations
