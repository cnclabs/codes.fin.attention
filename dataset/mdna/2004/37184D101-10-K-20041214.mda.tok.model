description of our business we are one of the largest providers of healthcare and support services to the elderly in the united states 
within our network of geographically concentrated facilities  we offer services focusing on the primary medical  physical and behavioral issues facing the medically complex elderly population 
our business is comprised of two primary business segments inpatient services and rehabilitation therapy services 
these segments are supported by complementary service capabilities 
approximately of our net revenues are generated through inpatient services 
our inpatient services are offered through a network of skilled nursing and assisted living centers primarily located in the eastern united states 
we currently own  lease  manage or jointly own eldercare facilities  consisting of skilled nursing facilities  assisted living facilities and transitional care units collectively having  beds 
our rehabilitation therapy services business  which represents approximately of our net revenues  provides an extensive range of rehabilitation therapy services to the elderly  including speech pathology  physical therapy and occupational therapy in our eldercare regional market concentrations 
we also provide other complementary healthcare services  the revenues for which are included in all other services revenues in our segment financial information 
inpatient services our eldercare centers are located in the following states connecticut  delaware  maryland  massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey  north carolina  pennsylvania  rhode island  vermont  virginia and west virginia 
approximately of our beds are concentrated in the states of pennsylvania  new jersey  maryland and massachusetts 
through our physicians  nurses  therapists and other members of our interdisciplinary medical care team  we apply a comprehensive approach to the complex needs facing the elderly  which we believe has resulted in above industry average occupancy levels and an enhanced level of medicare and private paying patients 
we receive higher rates of reimbursement from medicare and private paying patients 
for the twelve months ended september   the average occupancy level in our inpatient facilities was approximately  and approximately of our net revenues were from medicare and private paying patients 

back to index we employ physicians  physician assistants and nurse practitioners who are primarily involved in providing medical direction and or direct patient care at each center 
the emphasis on physician leadership is a strength that differentiates us from many other long term care companies 
in addition to physician executives  nursing center medical directors are administratively and clinically accountable for clinical care and quality improvement 
the nursing center medical directors are dually accountable to the administrator and the physician executive 
this medical staff structure allows for significant involvement of physicians at all levels of the organization thus ensuring that an emphasis on quality care is maintained 
directed by a senior nurse executive  we maintain a corporate quality improvement program to enhance and continuously improve care provided in each center 
in addition to clinical care  our centers provide our customers with dietary  housekeeping and laundry services  as well as social and recreational services 
our assisted living centers staff provides assistance with general activities of living such as medication management  bathing  dressing and meal preparation 
our assisted living centers offer a variety of daily social and therapeutic activities 
we have established and actively market programs for the elderly and other patients who require more complex levels of medical care 
we focus on clinically complex elderly patients who need extensive therapies and treatments to stabilize health problems before returning home or transitioning into a permanent long term care setting 
over of patients come to our centers directly from an acute care hospital stay and have five or more health problems that affect their ability to carry out everyday activities 
half of the elders who enter our centers for post acute care are discharged within days while the average stay for a long term care patient is days 
private insurance companies and other third party payors  including certain state medicaid programs  have recognized that treating patients requiring complex medical care in centers such as those we operate is a cost effective alternative to treatment in an acute care hospital 
we provide high acuity care at rates that we believe are substantially below the rates typically charged by acute care hospitals for comparable services 
the following table reflects our average number of beds in service and our average occupancy levels for the periods presented 
the average beds in service have not been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations  however  the owned and leased facility occupancy data does exclude discontinued operations year ended september  average beds in service owned and leased facilities    managed and jointly owned facilities    occupancy based on average beds in service owned and leased facilities managed and jointly owned facilities the following table reflects the payor mix of inpatient services revenues for the periods presented  and has been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations year ended september  medicaid medicare private pay and other 
back to index see revenue sources and government regulation 
rehabilitation therapy services segment we provide an extensive range of rehabilitation therapy services  including speech pathology  physical therapy and occupational therapy in all of our eldercare regional market concentrations 
these services are provided by approximately  licensed rehabilitation therapists and assistants employed or contracted by us at substantially all of the eldercare centers we operate  as well as by contract to healthcare facilities operated by others and through our certified outpatient rehabilitation agencies 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of our rehabilitation therapy services revenue was generated under contracts with unrelated third parties 
other services we provide management services to independently and jointly owned eldercare centers and transitional care units  which are the eldercare centers jointly owned and or managed referred to in inpatient services above  pursuant to management agreements that provide generally for the day to day responsibility for the operation and management of the centers 
in turn  we receive management fees  depending on the agreement  computed as an overall fixed fee  a fixed fee per customer  a percentage of net revenues of the center plus an incentive fee  or a percentage of gross revenues of the center with some incentive clauses 
the management agreements  including renewal option periods  are scheduled to terminate between and  of which are scheduled to terminate within the next twelve months 
we expect to renew a majority of the terminating contracts 
we also provide an array of other specialty medical services in certain parts of our eldercare network  including respiratory health services  physician services  hospitality services  staffing services and other related services 
our industry the aging of the population and increased life expectancies are the primary driving forces behind the growth of the nursing and assisted living facilities market in the united states 
according to the united states census bureau  in  there were approximately million americans aged or older  comprising approximately of the total united states population 
the number of americans aged or older is expected to climb to approximately million by and to approximately million by there are approximately  nursing homes with approximately million total beds certified to provide medicare and or medicaid services in the united states 
on average  approximately million people live in nursing homes during the course of a year 
we believe that these demographic trends will support a growing demand for the services provided by nursing and assisted living facility operators that deliver the most efficient  responsive  cost effective and highest quality eldercare services to support a full range of needs and acuity levels 
we also believe that these demographic considerations will place increased pressure on healthcare providers to find innovative  efficient means of delivering healthcare services 
see revenue sources 
our strategy the principal elements of our business strategy are to focus on quality care 
we are focused on qualitative and quantitative clinical performance measures in order to enhance and continuously improve the care provided in our facilities 
among other things  our management is financially incentivized by improvement in clinical performance  and we employ physician executives who are administratively and clinically accountable for clinical care and quality improvement 

back to index focus on operations 
we are focused on the key areas that improve revenues  profits and cash flows 
we are continually engaged in various efforts to improve our revenues  profits and cash flows by focusing on key operational initiatives  including leveraging our reputation for providing effective clinical outcomes in elderly care and rehabilitation to improve our payor mix by increasing our census of higher acuity medicare patients  improving nursing staff scheduling and retention while reducing reliance on overtime compensation and temporary nursing agency services  capitalizing on best demonstrated practices in various areas of cost control  such as purchasing  centralization of certain key administrative processes and leveraging our investments in information technology  actively managing our working capital  and increasing investment in our physical plant and information systems 
strengthen our presence in existing markets 
to grow revenues and profitability  we intend to invest selectively in attractive assets within our geographic concentrations  allowing us to leverage existing operations and to achieve greater operating efficiencies 
in addition  we will seek opportunities to increase the number of managed eldercare centers within our markets 
our competitive strengths we believe the following competitive strengths will enable us to continue to improve our profitability and cash flow geographically focused network 
we are regionally focused  and within our markets  we have developed strong referral networks with hospitals and discharge planners 
by focusing our operations in specific markets  we have achieved lower operating costs through greater purchasing power  operating efficiencies and economies of scale 
we are also able to design and customize our systems and services to meet the specific needs of each of our markets 
high acuity capabilities 
we focus on clinically complex elderly patients who require extensive therapies and treatments to stabilize health problems before returning home or transitioning into a permanent long term care setting 
over of our patients come to our facilities directly from an acute care hospital and require assistance to perform daily activities 
private insurance companies and other third party payors have recognized that treating patients requiring complex care in eldercare facilities  such as those operated by us  is a cost effective alternative to treatment in an acute care hospital 
high quality eldercare services 
we believe we have a reputation as a leading provider of high quality eldercare services 
as a result  we believe we have excellent relationships with hospitals and discharge planners  our primary referral sources 
we maintain a corporate compliance program to monitor and collect regulatory compliance data and to enhance and continuously improve the care provided in our facilities 
significant facility ownership 
we own rather than lease a majority of our eldercare facilities  unlike a number of our competitors 
excluding facilities held for sale  we own facilities with  beds  which represents approximately of the total number of beds we own or lease 
we believe that owning properties increases our operating and financial flexibility by enabling us to control more directly our occupancy costs  divest facilities and exit markets at our discretion and refurbish or remodel facilities in order to satisfy market demand 
admissions and discharge planning 
we have developed a successful model to process admissions through the automated tracking of bed availability and specialty care capacity at each of our facilities 
our model utilizes a multifaceted approach including clinical care coordinators and toll free phone lines to assist our marketing staff and direct referral sources 
as a result of our efforts  we have consistently achieved higher occupancy levels as compared to industry averages 
for the twelve month period ended september   our occupancy level was approximately compared to the industry median occupancy level of approximately  as reported in the june nursing facility state occupancy rate and median facility occupancy rate for certified beds cms oscar data current surveys issued by the american health care association 

back to index stable and experienced management team 
while we operate in a healthcare sector which has experienced significant volatility primarily due to a constantly changing reimbursement environment  our management team has remained substantially intact  with many years of operating experience working together 
our management team s collective experience allows us to address effectively the continuing challenges facing the industry while providing the stability necessary to achieve meaningful operational and financial improvements 
revenue sources we receive revenues from medicare  medicaid  private insurance  self pay residents and other third party payors 
our rehabilitation therapy services and other service related businesses also receive revenues from independent long term care facilities that utilize our services 
the sources and amounts of our revenues are determined by a number of factors  including licensed bed capacity and occupancy rates of our eldercare centers  the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors 
likewise  payment for ancillary medical services  including services provided by our rehabilitation therapy services business  vary based upon the type of payor and payment methodologies 
changes in the case mix of the patients as well as payor mix among medicare  medicaid and private pay can significantly affect our profitability 
medicare and medicaid the health insurance for aged and disabled act title xviii of the social security act  known as medicare  has made available to nearly every united states citizen years of age and older a broad program of health insurance designed to help the nation s elderly meet hospital and other healthcare costs 
the medicare program consists of four parts i medicare part a  which covers  among other things  inpatient hospital  skilled long term care  home healthcare and certain other types of healthcare services  ii medicare part b  which covers physicians services  outpatient services and certain items and services provided by medical suppliers  iii a managed care option for beneficiaries who are entitled to medicare part a and enrolled in medicare part b  known as medicare advantage or medicare part c and iv a new medicare part d benefit that becomes effective in covering prescription drugs 
under medicare part b  we are entitled to payment for medically necessary therapy services and products that replace a bodily function ie  ostomy supplies  home medical equipment and supplies and a limited number of specifically designated prescription drugs 
the medicare program is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
medicaid title xix of the social security act is a federal state matching program  whereby the federal government  under a need based formula  matches funds provided by the participating states for medical assistance to medically indigent persons 
the programs are administered by the applicable state welfare or social service agencies under federal rules 
although medicaid programs vary from state to state  traditionally they have provided for the payment of certain expenses  up to established limits  at rates determined in accordance with each state s regulations 
for skilled nursing centers  most states pay prospective rates  and have some form of acuity adjustment 
in addition to facility based services  most states cover an array of medical ancillary services 
payment methodologies for these services vary based upon state preferences and practices permitted under federal rules 
state medicaid programs generally have long established programs for reimbursement which have been revised and refined over time 
any future changes in such reimbursement programs or in regulations relating thereto  such as reductions in the allowable reimbursement levels or the timing of processing of payments  could adversely affect our business 
the annual increase in the federally matched funds could vary from state to state based on a variety of factors 
additionally  any shift from medicaid to state designated managed care plans could adversely affect our business 

back to index medicare and medicaid are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive rate adjustments  administrative rulings and government funding restrictions  all of which may materially affect the timing and or levels of payments to us for our services 
we are subject to periodic audits by the medicare and medicaid programs  which have various rights and remedies against us if they assert that we have overcharged the programs or failed to comply with program requirements 
these rights and remedies may include requiring the repayment of any amounts alleged to be overpayments or in violation of program requirements  or making deductions from future amounts due to us 
such programs may also impose fines  criminal penalties or program exclusions 
other third party payor sources also reserve rights to conduct audits and make monetary adjustments in connection with or inclusive of auditing activities 
laws affecting medicare revenues participating skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under a prospective payment system for inpatient medicare covered services 
the prospective payment system commenced with a facility s first cost reporting period beginning on or after july  and phased in over a three year period 
under the prospective payment system  or pps  skilled nursing facilities are paid a predetermined amount per patient  per day or per diem based on the anticipated costs of treating patients 
the per diem rate is determined by classifying each patient into one of resource utilization groups rugs iii using the information gathered as a result of each patient s minimum data set assessment 
there is a separate per diem rate for each of the resource utilization group classifications 
the per diem rate also covers rehabilitation and non rehabilitation ancillary services 
as implemented by cms  the prospective payment system has had an adverse impact on the medicare revenues of many skilled nursing facilities 
there have been three primary problems 
first  the base year calculations understate costs 
second  the market basket index used to trend payments forward does not adequately reflect market experience 
third  the resource utilization group case mix allocation is not adequately predictive of the costs of care for patients  and does not equitably allocate funding  especially for non therapy ancillary services 
congress has enacted five major laws during the past seven years that have significantly altered payment for skilled nursing facilities and medical ancillary services 
the balanced budget act  signed into law on august   reduced federal spending on medicare and medicaid programs 
the medicare balanced budget refinement act  enacted in november  addressed a number of the funding difficulties caused by the balanced budget act 
the benefits improvement and protection act  enacted on december   further modified the law and restored additional funding 
the jobs and growth tax reconciliation act of  enacted on may   provided temporary fiscal relief to states through an increase in federal support 
this temporary increase in federal support has helped stabilize state medicaid programs 
the medicare modernization act  enacted on december   created a new medicare prescription drug benefit  created incentives for greater private competition within medicare  adjusted coverage and payment terms for a number of providers and part b prescription drugs and reformed the administration of the medicare benefit 
the following is a brief summary of these laws and an overview of the impact of these enactments on us 
for a discussion of the effect of laws upon our business  see risk factors risk factors relating to our business 
in november  the balanced budget refinement act was passed in congress 
this enactment provided relief for certain reductions in medicare reimbursement caused by the balanced budget act 
for covered skilled nursing facility services furnished on or after april   the medicare per diem rate was increased by for resource utilization group payment categories  which we refer to as payment add ons 
while this provision was initially expected to adjust payment rates for only six months  cms withdrew proposed resource utilization group refinement rules 
these payment add ons will continue until cms completes certain mandated recalculations of current resource utilization group weightings 
cms affirms that its contractor  the urban institute  is expected to complete its study of the skilled nursing payment system in an effort to explore both short term and long term solutions to its case mix methodology 
the study recommendations are expected to be considered as part of the proposed fiscal year rules  effective october  we refer to the anticipated refinement to the resource utilization group classification system as rugs refinement 
although we are unable to predict with certainty the extent of the impact of rugs refinement on our operating results  we believe it could result in a significant reduction in our ebitda 
see risk factors risk factors relating to our business 

back to index on december   congress passed the benefits improvement protection act  increasing the nursing component of federal prospective payment system s rates by approximately for the period from april  through september  the legislation also changed the add on to of the rehabilitation resource utilization group categories to a add on to all rehabilitation resource utilization group categories beginning april  the medicare part b consolidated billing provision of the balance budget refinement act was repealed except for medicare part b therapy services and the moratorium on implementing  payment caps therapy caps on medicare part b rehabilitation therapy services was extended through calendar year these changes had a positive impact on our operating results 
a number of provisions of the balanced budget refinement act and the benefits improvement and protection act  providing additional funding for medicare participating skilled nursing facilities  expired on september  resulting in an approximate reduction in the rates paid to us for providing services to medicare patients 
we refer to the expiration of the additional funding as the skilled nursing facility medicare cliff 
effective october   medicare rates adjusted for the skilled nursing facility medicare cliff were increased by a annual inflation update factor 
for us  the net impact of these provisions adversely impacted annual revenue and ebitda in fiscal by approximately million 
the final fiscal year prospective payment system rules for skilled nursing facilities became effective on october  the final rules enhanced the reimbursement rates for fiscal year by increasing base rates by a increase in the annual inflation update factor and a upward adjustment correcting previous forecast errors 
the final rules also provided for the continuation through fiscal year of certain payment add ons that were authorized in the balanced budget refinement act to compensate for non therapy ancillaries 
on july   cms published notice of the fiscal year prospective payment system rates that became effective october  the fiscal year rules provide for a increase in the annual inflation update factor 
the medicare modernization act suspended application of the  payment caps therapy caps on medicare part b rehabilitation through december  the therapy caps in place effective september  imposed payment limits to services provided by independent therapists as well as to those provided by outpatient rehabilitation facilities and other forms of rehabilitation agencies 
the suspension did not have retroactive impact upon medicare beneficiaries who exceeded their caps between september  and december  extension of the moratorium removes a significant financial threat to our therapy business for the short term 
previously  we estimated that the therapy caps would reduce our annual net revenues by approximately million and ebitda by approximately million 
the new law also assures at least a positive increase in the therapy fee schedule through calendar year no assurances can be made or given that congress will extend the moratorium on application of the therapy caps beyond calendar year as mandated by the law  the general accounting office is conducting a study of alternatives to the therapy caps 
see risk factors risk factors relating to our business 
laws affecting medicaid revenues the balanced budget act of repealed the boren amendment federal payment standard for payments to medicaid nursing facilities  effective october  this repeal gave the states greater latitude in setting payment rates for nursing facilities 
budget constraints and other factors have caused some states to curb medicaid reimbursement to nursing facilities and states may continue to curb or delay payments to nursing facilities in the future 
the law also granted the states greater flexibility in establishing medicaid managed care programs without the need to obtain a federal waiver 
although these waiver programs generally exempted institutional care  including nursing facility services  these programs could ultimately change the medicaid reimbursement system for long term care 
massachusetts has received a federal government waiver to initiate a voluntary  long term care managed care program and maryland is in the design stage of a waiver request mandating managed long term care for individuals eligible for both medicare and medicaid dual eligibles 
these changes could include changing reimbursement for pharmacy services from fee for service  or payment per procedure or service rendered  to a fixed amount per person utilizing managed care negotiated or capitated rates 

back to index the benefits improvement and protection act of enacted a phase out of intergovernmental transfer transactions by states whereby states would artificially inflate the payments to certain public facilities to increase federal matching funds 
this action may have had the effect of reducing federal support for a number of state medicaid programs 
the reduced federal payments may impact aggregate available funds requiring states to further contain payments to providers 
we operate in several of the states that have experienced or will experience a contraction of federal matching funds 
state budget pressures in recent years have translated into reductions in the rate of state spending growth in certain jurisdictions 
given that medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets  we expect continuing cost containment pressures on medicaid outlays for skilled nursing facilities in the states in which we operate 
in each of the major states where we provide services  we are working with trade groups  consultants and government officials to address responsibly the particular funding issues 
the plight of state governments has helped to elevate issues related to medicaid onto the national agenda 
in  congress passed temporary relief to states providing a increase in the federal medicaid assistance percentage for five quarters estimated to provide states billion in medicaid relief 
that assistance terminated on june  actions to date on state medicaid budgets affirm that many states are adjusting downward state medicaid spending to reflect the loss of the temporary federal assistance 
medicaid funding is set annually 
most states have completed formulating their fiscal year budgets 
to date  detailed rate notices from states for fiscal year inpatient nursing home services have been in line with our expectations 
as part of the state budget process  a number of states have indicated a desire to divert individuals from placement in nursing homes through an expansion of home and community based services 
most of these efforts are being established under demonstration and waiver authority 
to date  these alternative care programs have not significantly impacted nursing home admissions 
certain important studies on medicaid nursing home reimbursement were released during our fiscal year late in november  the general accounting office released a study examining how nursing home reimbursement has been affected by the fiscal crisis being experienced by a number of states 
the report documents that most states have sustained their reimbursement commitments 
states have tapped reserves  tobacco settlement monies and other funding strategies including provider assessments to meet their obligations 
similar conclusions were reached by an academic study published in june in health affairs 
while the data in both studies does not evaluate the adequacy of state medicaid payments for nursing facility services  the analysis does suggest that under current difficult conditions states are honoring their commitments 
the reports are consistent with observed behavior in the states where we operate 
among the alternative medicaid funding approaches that states have explored are nursing home provider assessments as tools for leveraging increased medicaid matching funds 
such initiatives are authorized under the law 
nursing home provider assessments have been implemented in five states where we operate massachusetts  west virginia  rhode island  north carolina and new hampshire 
during june  new state laws were enacted in both new hampshire and new jersey amending previously enacted provider assessment laws to address federal approval concerns 
given successful negotiations with cms  new hampshire has approved its provider assessment program retroactive to may  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million of revenue which increased ebitda by million for the new hampshire provider assessment for the period may  through september  new jersey has submitted for federal government approval a revised state plan amendment 
pennsylvania continues to negotiate with the federal government to resolve items in dispute in their provider assessment submission 
given the on going negotiations between these states and cms  it is not possible to complete an accurate evaluation of the financial impact of these provider assessment proposals 
if enacted  we expect their implementation to have a positive impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
further delays in the federal processing of the pending provider assessment plans in new jersey and pennsylvania could adversely impact future nursing home funding in both jurisdictions 

back to index it is not possible to quantify fully the effect of legislative changes  the interpretation or administration of such legislation or any other governmental initiatives on our business and the business of the customers served by our rehabilitation services business 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the impact of any future healthcare legislation or regulation will not further adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental and private third party payor programs will be timely  will remain at levels similar to present levels or will  in the future  be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to such programs 
our financial condition and results of operations are affected by the reimbursement process  which in the healthcare industry is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the time that revenue is recognized and the time that reimbursement amounts are settled 
government regulation general our business is subject to extensive federal  state and  in some cases  local regulation with respect to  among other things  participation in the medicare and medicaid programs  licensure  certification and government reimbursement 
for our eldercare centers  these regulations relate  among other things  to the adequacy of physical plant and equipment  qualifications of personnel  standards of care  government reimbursement and operational requirements 
compliance with such regulatory requirements  as interpreted and amended from time to time  can increase operating costs and thereby adversely affect the financial viability of our business 
failure to comply with current or future regulatory requirements could also result in the imposition of various remedies including fines  restrictions on admission  denial of payment for all or new admissions  the revocation of licensure  decertification  imposition of temporary management or the closure of the facility 
licensure  certification and regulation our eldercare centers and healthcare services  to the extent required  are currently licensed under applicable law 
our skilled nursing centers and healthcare services  or practitioners providing the services therein  are certified or approved as providers under one or more of the medicaid and medicare programs 
generally  assisted living centers are not eligible to be certified under medicare or medicaid 
licensing  certification and other applicable standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are revised periodically 
state and local agencies survey all skilled nursing centers on a regular basis to determine whether such centers are in compliance with governmental operating and health standards and conditions for participation in government sponsored third party payor programs 
we believe that our eldercare centers and other sites of service are in substantial compliance with the various medicare  medicaid and state regulatory requirements applicable to them 
however  in the ordinary course of our business  we receive notices of deficiencies for failure to comply with condition of participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
we review such notices and take appropriate corrective action 
in these cases  we submit our plan to bring the center into compliance with regulations which must be accepted by the reviewing agency 
in some cases  the reviewing federal or state agency may take various adverse actions against a provider  including but not limited to the imposition of fines  suspension of payments for new or all admissions to the center  and in extreme circumstances  decertification from participation in the medicare or medicaid programs and revocation of a center s or service site s license 
these actions may adversely affect a center s ability to continue to operate  ability to provide certain services  and or eligibility to participate in the medicare or medicaid programs or to receive payments from other payors 
certain of our centers have received notices that  as a result of certain alleged deficiencies  federal and or state agencies were taking steps to impose remedies 
additionally  actions taken by one center or service site may subject other centers or service sites under common control or ownership to adverse remedies 

back to index all of our skilled nursing centers participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 
both initial and continuing qualifications of a skilled nursing center to participate in such programs depend upon many factors including accommodations  equipment  services  patient care  safety  personnel  physical environment  and adequate policies  procedures and controls 
several states in which we operate have adopted certificate of need or similar laws which generally require that a state agency approve certain acquisitions and determine the need for certain bed additions  new services  and capital expenditures 
state approvals are generally issued for a specified maximum expenditure and require implementation of the proposal within a specified period of time 
failure to obtain the necessary state approval can result in the inability to provide the service  the inability to operate the centers  the inability to complete the acquisition  addition or other change  and the imposition of sanctions or adverse action on the center s license and adverse reimbursement action 
during recent years several states have passed legislation altering their certificate of need requirements 
virginia is expected to phase out its certificate of need requirement and maryland is studying a similar action 
these changes are not expected to alter our business opportunities materially 
laws affecting billing and business practices we are also subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers 
these laws often prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider for medical products and services 
these laws include the anti kickback provisions of the federal medicare and medicaid programs  which prohibit  among other things  knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or paying any remuneration including any kickback  bribe or rebate directly or indirectly in return for or to induce the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under medicare or medicaid 
penalties may include imprisonment  fines  exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and loss of license  and the stark laws which prohibit  with limited exceptions  the referral of patients by physicians for certain services  including home health services  physical therapy and occupational therapy  to an entity in which the physician has a financial interest 
penalties may include denial of payment  mandatory refund of prior payment  civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and other providers of healthcare services 
possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs and civil and criminal penalties 
these laws vary from state to state  are often complex and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
from time to time  we have sought guidance as to the interpretation of these laws  however  there can be no assurance that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with our practices 

back to index there have also been a number of recent federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
during the past few years  the department of health and human services  or dhhs  has issued a series of voluntary compliance guidelines 
these compliance guidelines provide guidance on acceptable practices 
skilled nursing facility services and durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics  supplies  and supplier performance practices have been among the services addressed in these publications 
our corporate integrity program is working to assure that our practices conform to regulatory requirements 
dhhs also issues fraud alerts and advisory opinions 
for example  directives concerning double billing  home health services  the provision of medical supplies to nursing facilities  and most recently  contractual joint venture relationships have been released 
it is anticipated that areas addressed by these advisories may come under closer scrutiny by the government 
while we have reviewed government guidance  we cannot predict accurately the impact of any such initiatives 
laws governing health information we face additional federal requirements that mandate major changes in the transmission and retention of health information 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  was enacted to ensure  first  that employees can retain and at times transfer their health insurance when they change jobs  and secondly  to simplify healthcare administrative processes 
this simplification includes expanded protection of the privacy and security of personal medical data and requires the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information 
among the standards that dhhs has or may adopt pursuant to hipaa are standards for the following electronic transactions and code sets  unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals  security and electronic signatures  privacy  and enforcement 
although hipaa was intended to ultimately reduce administrative expenses and burdens faced within the healthcare industry  we believe that implementation of this law has resulted in additional costs 
we have established a hipaa task force consisting of clinical  financial and informational services professionals focused on hipaa compliance 
dhhs has released three rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information 
the first rule establishes uniform standards for common healthcare transactions  including healthcare claims information  plan eligibility  referral certification and authorization  claims status  plan enrollment and disenrollment  payment and remittance advice  plan premium payments  and coordination of benefits 
second  dhhs has released standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
these standards not only require our compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of protected health information  but they also require us to impose those rules  by contract  on any business associate to whom we disclose information 
third  dhhs has released rules governing the security of health information maintained or transmitted in electronic form 
dhhs finalized the transaction standards on august  dhhs issued the privacy standards on december   and  after certain delays  they became effective on april   with a compliance date of april  on february   dhhs issued final rules governing the security of health information 
these rules specify a series of administrative  technical and physical security procedures to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information 
affected parties will have until april  to be fully compliant 
sanctions for failing to comply with hipaa health information practices provisions include criminal penalties and civil sanctions 
in january  cms announced the adoption of the national provider identifier as the standard unique health identifier for health care providers to use in filing and processing health care claims and other transactions 
the rule is effective may  at this time  our management anticipates that we will be able to fully comply with those hipaa requirements that have been adopted 
as part of our corporate integrity program  we monitor our compliance with hipaa 
our compliance and privacy officer is responsible for administering the corporate integrity program which includes hipaa related compliance 
although our management cannot at this time estimate the cost of compliance  nor can our management estimate the cost of compliance with standards that have not yet been finalized by dhhs  we do not believe that the cost of compliance is having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

back to index corporate integrity program our corporate integrity program was developed to assure that we strive to achieve our goal of providing a high level of care and service in a manner consistent with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations and our internal standard of conduct 
this program is intended to allow personnel to prevent  detect and resolve any conduct or action that fails to satisfy all applicable laws and our standard of conduct 
we have a corporate compliance officer responsible for administering the corporate integrity program 
the corporate compliance officer  with the approval of the chief executive officer or the board of directors  may use any of our resources to evaluate and resolve compliance issues 
the corporate compliance officer reports significant compliance issues to the board of directors 
we established the corporate integrity program hotline  which offers a toll free number available to all of our employees to report compliance issues  including any alleged privacy violations under hipaa 
all calls reporting alleged non compliance are logged  investigated  addressed and remedied by appropriate company officials 
the corporate integrity subcommittee was established to ensure a mechanism exists for us to monitor compliance issues 
the corporate integrity subcommittee members are senior members of the finance  human resources  information systems  legal  clinical practices  internal audit and operations departments 
periodically  we receive information from dhhs regarding individuals and providers that are excluded from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
providers may include medical directors  attending physicians  vendors  consultants  therapists and other clinical staff 
on a monthly basis  management compares the information provided by dhhs to databases containing providers and individuals doing business with us 
any potential matches are investigated and any necessary corrective action is taken to ensure we cease doing business with that provider and or individual 
personnel we and our industry continue to experience shortages in qualified professional clinical staff 
we compete with other healthcare providers and with non healthcare providers for both professional and non professional employees 
as the demand for these services continually exceeds the supply of available and qualified staff  we and our competitors have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals and to utilize outside contractors for these services at premium rates 
furthermore  the competitive arena for this shrinking labor market has created high turnover among clinical professional staff as many seek to take advantage of the supply of available positions  each offering new and more attractive wage and benefit packages 
in addition to the wage pressures inherent in this environment  the cost of training new employees amid the high turnover rates has created added pressure on our operating margins 
lastly  increased attention to the quality of care provided in skilled nursing facilities has caused several states to mandate and other states to consider mandating minimum staffing laws that further increase the gap between demand for and supply of qualified individuals and lead to higher labor costs 
while we have been able to retain the services of an adequate number of qualified personnel to staff our facilities and sites of service appropriately and maintain our standards of quality care  there can be no assurance that continued shortages will not affect our ability to attract and maintain an adequate staff of qualified healthcare personnel in the future 
a lack of qualified personnel at a facility could result in significant increases in labor costs and an increased reliance on expensive temporary agencies at such facility or otherwise adversely affect operations at such facility 
any of these developments could adversely affect our operating results or expansion plans 

back to index in recognition of the competitive nature of clinical staff recruitment and retention  we have implemented the following reward  recognition and professional development programs shared governance  a structure to support the participation of nurses in the development and implementation of policies  projects and processes which affect their practice has been instituted  stepp steps to excellence in professional practice  a clinical advancement program which allows nurses to receive recognition and compensation for clinical expertise  has been implemented  and tap tuition assistance program  a program designed to provide eligible employees with financial assistance to pursue education and training through defined degree and certified programs of study related to professional career growth 
in addition  we recently hired an individual specifically responsible for the management of recruitment and retention of rehabilitation therapists 
our focus on recruitment  retention and continuing education has led us to identify even greater needs for professional development 
in response  in fiscal we have designated a chief learning officer dedicated to the pursuit of employee retention and growth 
we employ approximately  people 
we have centers that have certified unions that have entered into collective bargaining agreements 
we have four centers that have certified unions that currently have not entered into a collective bargaining agreement 
the agreements expire at various dates through and cover approximately  employees 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is generally good 
we have entered into an agreement with the service employees international union seiu to provide for one collective bargaining agreement which will cover our six currently unionized seiu buildings and under which the seiu may attempt to organize of our currently non unionized centers in the state of new jersey between september and may the agreement emphasizes our positive relationship and common goals shared with the seiu in the state of new jersey 
the agreement contains a formula which ties increases in employee wages and benefits to increases in the combined per patient day rates of the covered centers and protects us and our employees from lock outs and or strikes 
the initial term of the agreement will expire in september marketing marketing for eldercare centers is focused at the local level and is conducted primarily by a dedicated regional marketing staff that calls on referral sources such as hospitals  hospital discharge planners  doctors and various community organizations 
in addition to those efforts  our marketing objective is to maintain public awareness of our eldercare centers and their capabilities 
we take advantage of our regional concentrations in our marketing efforts  where appropriate  through consolidated marketing programs  which benefit more than one center 
toll free regional phone lines assist the marketing staff and direct referral sources  which speeds admissions by automated tracking of bed availability and specialty care capabilities for each of our centers and all of our affiliated centers 
we market our rehabilitation therapy services and other services through a direct sales force which primarily calls on eldercare centers  hospitals  clinics and home health agencies 

back to index historically  we operated our core business under the name genesis eldercare 
our logos  trademarks and service marks are featured in print advertisements in publications serving the regional markets in which we operate 
we are using advertising  including our toll free eldercare lines  to promote our brand names in trade  professional and business publications and to promote services directly to consumers 
competition we compete with a variety of other companies in providing healthcare services to older adults 
certain competing organizations have greater financial and other resources and may be more established in their respective communities than we are 
competing companies may offer newer or different centers or services than us  including a variety of community based services  and may thereby attract our patients who are either presently residents of our eldercare centers or are otherwise receiving our healthcare services 
we operate eldercare centers in states 
in each market  our eldercare centers may compete for patients with rehabilitation hospitals  subacute units of hospitals  skilled or intermediate nursing centers  and personal care or residential centers 
certain of these providers are operated by not for profit organizations and similar businesses that can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or receive charitable contributions unavailable to us 
in competing for patients  a center s local reputation is of paramount importance 
referrals typically come from acute care hospitals  physicians  religious groups  health maintenance organizations  the patient s families and friends  and other community organizations 
members of a patient s family generally actively participate in the selection of an eldercare center 
competition for medically complex patients is intense among acute care hospitals with long term care capability  rehabilitation hospitals and other specialty providers and is expected to remain so in the future 
important competitive factors include the reputation in the community  services offered  the appearance of a center  and the cost of services 
we compete in providing rehabilitation therapy services and other healthcare services with a variety of different companies 
generally  this competition is regional and local in nature 
the primary competitive factors in these businesses are similar to those in the inpatient services business and include reputation  the cost of services  the quality of clinical services  responsiveness to patient needs  and the ability to provide support in other areas such as third party reimbursement  information management and patient record keeping 
insurance the vast majority of our exposure to general and professional liability claims is insured by commercial insurers subject to per claim and aggregate retention limits 
the retentions are insured by our wholly owned captive insurance company  liberty health corporation  ltd 
lhc 
the vast majority of our exposure to workers compensation liability claims is fully insured by lhc 
growth in general and professional liability insurance premiums for coverage above our retention has risen dramatically in recent years 
we have managed this increase by assuming additional retention through lhc and by more proactively managing claims 
the dramatic increase in costs are particularly acute in the state of florida where  because certain laws allow for significantly higher liability awards than in other states  general liability and professional liability costs have increased substantially 
in fiscal  we sold all of our approximately  skilled nursing and assisted living beds in the state of florida  representing six percent of our then owned and leased beds 
we provide several health insurance options to our employees  including a self insured health plan and several fully insured health maintenance organizations 
growth in health insurance premiums in the market has risen to to in recent years 
our business is a labor intensive business  and therefore health insurance costs represent a significant expense for us 
in recent years  we have partially managed this increase with changes in program offerings 
continuing increases substantially in excess of inflation could have a negative impact on our profitability  as further shifts in responsibility for these cost increases to the employee may not be possible 

back to index we believe that adequate reserves are in place to cover the ultimate liability related to general and professional liability  workers compensation and health insurance claims exposure 
however  there can be no assurance that any current or future claims will not exceed applicable insurance reserves or that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will be able to maintain adequate coverage 
other environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
management does not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures  results of operations or financial condition

back to index item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest providers of healthcare and support services to the elderly in the united states 
within our network of geographically concentrated facilities  we offer services focusing on the primary medical  physical and behavioral issues facing the medically complex elderly population 
we are focused on qualitative and quantitative clinical performance measures in order to enhance and improve continuously the care provided in our facilities 
through our physicians  nurses  therapists and other members of our interdisciplinary medical care team  we apply a comprehensive approach to the complex needs facing the elderly  which we believe has resulted in our above industry average occupancy levels and an enhanced level of medicare and private paying patients 
we receive higher rates of reimbursement from medicare and private paying patients 
for the twelve months ended september   the average occupancy level in our inpatient facilities was approximately  and approximately of our net revenues were from medicare and private paying patients 
approximately of our net revenues are generated through inpatient services segment 
our inpatient services business is offered through a network of skilled nursing and assisted living centers primarily located in the eastern united states 
our eldercare centers are concentrated in the states of pennsylvania  new jersey  maryland and massachusetts 
we currently own  lease  manage or jointly own eldercare facilities  consisting of skilled nursing facilities  assisted living facilities and transitional care units together totaling  beds 
our rehabilitation therapy segment  which represents approximately of our net revenues  provides an extensive range of rehabilitation therapy services to the elderly  including speech pathology  physical therapy and occupational therapy in our eldercare regional market concentrations 
these services are provided by approximately  licensed rehabilitation therapists and assistants employed or contracted by us at substantially all of the eldercare facilities we operate  as well as by contract to third party healthcare facilities operated by other providers and through our outpatient rehabilitation agencies 
we also provide other complementary healthcare services  the revenues for which are included in all other services revenues in our segment financial information 
the aging of the population and increased life expectancies are the primary driving forces behind the growth of our businesses 
we believe that positive demographic trends imply that there will be a growing demand for the services offered by healthcare providers that deliver the most efficient  responsive  cost effective and high quality eldercare services 
we are continually engaged in various efforts to improve our profitability by focusing on key operational initiatives  including improving the level of medicare and private paying patients  increasing our rate of occupancy  improving nursing staff scheduling and retention  reducing reliance on overtime compensation and temporary agency services  and capitalizing on best demonstrated practices in various areas of cost control 
as a result  we believe we will be well positioned to take advantage of the favorable demographic and growth trends in our industry 
government funded programs  principally medicaid and medicare  provide approximately of our revenue 
over the past five years  changes in funding from these government sources has had a significant impact on our cash flows and profitability 
through trade and other organizations  we actively participate in partnership with other healthcare providers to pursue strategies to minimize any potentially adverse impact of government funding proposals 
we believe the continuation of government funding at levels sufficient to operate our business profitably is our greatest financial risk 

back to index labor costs  including salaries  wages and benefits  account for approximately of our total operating expenses 
we compete with other healthcare providers and with non healthcare providers for both professional and non professional employees 
in recent years  we and our industry have experienced shortages in qualified professional clinical staff 
while in our inpatient services segment we have been able to retain the services of an adequate number of qualified personnel to staff our facilities and sites of services  we have used expensive temporary nursing agency services to supplement staffing  particularly in fiscal and in fiscal  we implemented programs to improve staff scheduling and retention  and to reduce reliance on overtime compensation and temporary nursing agency services 
our efforts resulted in a reduction in the cost of temporary nursing staff in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and a reduction in fiscal as compared to fiscal  without experiencing a significant change in overall nursing hours per patient day 
however  if a shortage of nurses or other health care workers occurred in the geographic areas in which we operate  it could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and could further increase our operating costs  without a corresponding increase in the level of government funded reimbursement 
in fiscal  we and our industry are experiencing a shortage of qualified rehabilitation therapists 
as the demand for these services continues to exceed the supply of available therapists  we and our competitors have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals while utilizing outside contractors for these services at premium rates 
although we have been able to retain adequate levels of qualified therapists to maintain our standards of quality care in the services we provide  the shortage of qualified therapists has impacted negatively our ability to generate new therapy business 
we recently hired an individual specifically responsible for the management of recruitment and retention of rehabilitation therapists

tidewater membership agreement the tidewater membership agreement  referred to as the tidewater agreement  provides group purchasing and shared service programs to skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities operated by us 
under the tidewater agreement  we engaged tidewater  nci s wholly owned group purchasing subsidiary  as an independent group purchasing organization  and tidewater will grant to us access to its vendor contracts 
the initial term of the tidewater agreement is ten years 
we will not make any payments to nci under the tidewater agreement

such fees are based on a percentage of the volume of purchases made by all of tidewater s members  including us 
we will remain directly responsible to vendors for purchases through the tidewater agreement 
the tidewater agreement will obligate us to purchase certain minimum amounts  however  we may be a member of other group purchasing organizations 
we may earn financial incentives  such as fee sharing  for meeting certain purchasing volumes under the tidewater agreement 
employee benefits agreement we and nci entered into an employee benefits agreement which provides for certain employee compensation  benefit and labor related matters 
in general  after the spin off  we and nci are responsible for all obligations and liabilities relating to our respective current and former employees and their dependents and beneficiaries 
as of the date of the spin off  and except with respect to health and welfare plans and flexible benefit plans as set forth below  we ceased participation in any benefit plan or trust under any such plan sponsored or maintained by nci  and nci ceased participation in any benefit plan or trust under any such plan sponsored or maintained by us 
with respect to employees who are transferred to or from us or nci  both parties will mutually recognize and credit service with the other employer

in general  all liabilities relating to workers compensation claims incurred by or on behalf of either company s employees on or before december   the date of the spin off  will remain liabilities of us 
to avoid the administrative inconvenience and expense that would result from our having to establish separate health and welfare plans and flexible benefit plans for the remainder of the calendar year during which the spin off occurs  during the period beginning immediately following the spin off and ending on december   current and former employees of ours remained covered under nci s existing health and welfare plans and flexible benefit plans 
we have reimbursed nci for all expenses it incurred as a result of this arrangement 
as of january   current and former employees of ours and nci are covered under their own health insurance plans 
master agreement for pharmacy  pharmacy consulting and related products and services we and nci s subsidiary  neighborcare pharmacy services  inc  or ncps  entered into a master agreement for pharmacy  pharmacy consulting and related products and services  referred to as the pharmacy services agreement 
the agreement has an initial term of ten years  plus a renewal term of five years if ncps matches third party bids for comparable services 
the pharmacy services agreement provides the terms and conditions on which ncps and its affiliates provides pharmacy  pharmacy consulting and medical supply products and services to all long term care facilities owned or leased by us and our affiliates 

back to index each of our eldercare facilities entered into an individual services agreement with ncps that reflects the terms of the pharmacy services agreement 
the individual services agreements govern the terms under which pharmacy  pharmacy consulting and medical supply products and services will be provided to each eldercare facility by ncps 
pricing under the pharmacy services agreement is at pre negotiated prices or formulas consistent with market pricing for the applicable services and are set forth in the individual service agreements 
ncps has the right to adjust prices  other than those that are determined by formula  not more than once per year to account for increases in its costs in providing the services including inflation 
we are eligible for a pricing reduction at specified percentages for certain specified products and services if and so long as the aggregate number of skilled nursing facility beds served by ncps increases to specified targets over a baseline amount 
in addition  we and ncps will negotiate in good faith to enter into arrangements whereby we will contract directly with certain manufacturers of enteral nutrition products  durable medical equipment and other non pharmaceutical products historically purchased from ncps to receive end user pricing  and ncps will distribute enteral nutrition products and durable medical equipment to our facilities for a fee priced at the fair market value of such distribution services 
after five years  pricing may be reset depending upon ncps s pricing to its other customers of similar size 
moreover  we and nci will negotiate in good faith to amend the pharmacy services agreement and the individual services agreements in the event of and in a manner consistent with a modification of any applicable law or regulation  or interpretation thereof  that has the effect of prohibiting or restricting the terms of the pharmacy services agreement 
the pharmacy services agreement further provides that if average wholesale price or other descriptors of pricing in the agreement or any service agreement are no longer reasonably commercially available to be utilized to determine pharmacy pricing  we and nci will re negotiate the specific pricing applicable to the services provided to a substantially equivalent amount 
on may   we and nci amended the master agreement for pharmacy  pharmacy consulting and related products and services to correct a pricing error in the original agreement specifically related to intravenous drugs 
the financial impact of the amendment increases our pharmacy costs million on an annualized basis  which has been reflected in our financial results 
the amendment also accelerates by nine months our ability to renegotiate pricing with nci 
we may terminate the pharmacy services agreement with respect to any facility in connection with a sale of the facility to a third party or the closing of the facility so long as we use our best efforts to persuade the buyer or successor of the facility  if any  to assume the applicable service agreement 
this right is limited to five facilities through the first year  facilities through the second year  facilities through the third year  and a maximum of facilities over the year term of the pharmacy services agreement 
if the pharmacy services agreement or any individual service agreement is terminated by us  then ncps will be entitled to recover a specified amount per facility based on the remaining number of months in the term 
both we and ncps will indemnify the other against all claims  losses and liabilities arising out of the acts or omissions of the other party in connection with the pharmacy services agreement 
the pharmacy services agreement provides that we will not compete with ncps or solicit ncps s employees or customers until or  if later  two years following termination of the pharmacy services agreement 
pharmacy benefit management carecard agreement we and nci s subsidiary  carecard  inc  entered into a pharmacy benefit management agreement  referred to as the carecard agreement

the durable medical equipment agreement provides for an initial five year term with one year automatic renewals unless terminated upon days notice prior to the expiration of the then current term 
under the durable medical equipment agreement  ncps agreed to provide our facilities with durable medical equipment specialty beds and oxygen concentrators  equipment maintenance and warehousing of equipment at prices set forth in the durable medical equipment agreement

eldertrust ventas transactions on august   we acquired the remaining ownership interest in an unconsolidated joint venture partnership that operates four skilled nursing facilities with skilled nursing and assisted living beds 
each of the four eldercare centers had been leased to the partnership from eldertrust  a real estate investment trust from which we leased or subleased of our eldercare facilities and eight of our managed and jointly owned facilities 
we purchased our joint venture partner s interest in the unconsolidated partnership for million and subsequently purchased one of the four eldercare properties from eldertrust for million 
additionally  we paid eldertrust million to reduce the annual cash basis and accrual basis lease expense of one of the three remaining leased facilities by million and million  respectively 
the lease terms of the three facilities that continue to be leased from eldertrust were extended from to on september   we entered into additional agreements with eldertrust  the principal terms were as follows we agreed to purchase two skilled nursing facilities having skilled nursing beds and assisted living beds  and three assisted living facilities having beds  for million 
we previously leased these properties from eldertrust at an annual cash basis and accrual basis lease cost of million and million  respectively 
as of january   we purchased all of the aforementioned eldercare facilities  we agreed to pay eldertrust million to reduce annual cash basis and accrual basis lease cost associated with nine properties by million and million  respectively  and acquire options to purchase seven properties currently subleased to us by eldertrust 
on october   we paid eldertrust million to reduce the rents of two of the nine eldercare facilities  and on november  paid eldertrust the remaining million to reduce the rents of the other seven aforementioned eldercare facilities  and eldertrust was paid million upon consummation of the spin off in exchange for eldertrust s consent to the assignment of all remaining leases and guarantees from nci to us 
in february  eldertrust shareholders approved the merger of eldertrust with ventas sub  llc ventas  a delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of ventas  inc  a publicly traded delaware corporation 
this merger did not have a material impact on us 
in june  ventas exercised its option to purchase an assisted living facility from us for cash consideration of million 
we leased the property back from ventas under a year operating lease agreement 
we recognized a million gain on the sale of the property  which has been deferred and will be amortized on a straight line basis to lease expense over the year lease term 

back to index assets held for sale and discontinued operations in the normal course of business  we continually evaluate the performance of our operating units  with an emphasis on selling or closing under performing or non strategic assets 
on september   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
under sfas  discontinued businesses  including assets held for sale  are removed from the results of continuing operations 
the results of operations in the current and prior year periods  along with any cost to exit such businesses in the year of discontinuation  are classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
since our adoption of sfas  we have classified several businesses as held for sale or closed 
an increasing trend in malpractice litigation claims  rising costs of eldercare malpractice litigation  losses associated with these malpractice lawsuits and a constriction of insurers have caused many insurance carriers to raise the cost of insurance premiums or refuse to write insurance policies for nursing homes 
these problems are particularly acute in the state of florida where  because of higher claim amounts  general liability and professional liability costs have become increasingly expensive 
this increase in insurance costs prompted us to sell our otherwise profitable operations in the state of florida during fiscal since our inception  we have continued to develop our eldercare network in concentrated geographic markets in the eastern united states 
the geographic location of our eldercare centers in the states of illinois and wisconsin relative to our strategic geographic markets  combined with the operating performance of those centers  prompted us to identify those assets as held for sale during fiscal in addition to these assets  since we have identified eldercare centers in other states  one rehabilitation therapy services clinic  two physician services practices and our ambulance and diagnostics businesses as held for sale or closed due to under performance 
interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations for all periods presented based on debt expected to be repaid in connection with the sale of the assets 
the amount of after tax interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million  and million  respectively 
we have separately classified million and million of carrying value associated with our assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets at september  and  respectively 
our assets held for sale are classified in the consolidated balance sheets within both current and non current assets 
the current portion of assets held for sale represents those assets for which we have binding agreements of sale 
in december  we sold our two remaining wisconsin based eldercare centers for net cash proceeds of million 
the following table sets forth net revenues and the components of loss from discontinued operations for the years ended september    and in thousands net revenues    net operating loss of discontinued businesses   loss on discontinuation of businesses   income tax benefit    loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes   the loss on discontinuation of businesses includes the write down of assets to estimated net realizable value 

back to index purchase of joint venture interests on january   we acquired our joint venture partner s interest in two skilled nursing facilities in the commonwealth of massachusetts which we previously managed 
we previously owned a interest in one facility and a interest in the other 
upon completion of the transaction  we own of both facilities and acquired approximately million of working capital along with the property and equipment of the two skilled nursing facilities  having a total of beds 
the aggregate consideration consisted of million in cash and the assumption of debt in the amount of approximately million  million of which was repaid following completion of the transactions 
revenue sources we receive revenues from medicare  medicaid  private insurance  self pay residents and other third party payors 
our rehabilitation therapy services and other service related businesses also receive revenues from long term care facilities that utilize our services 
the following table reflects the payor mix of inpatient service revenues for the periods presented  and has been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations year ended september  medicaid medicare private pay and other the sources and amounts of our revenues are determined by a number of factors  including licensed bed capacity and occupancy rates of our eldercare centers  the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors 
likewise  payment for ancillary medical services  including services provided by our rehabilitation therapy services business  vary based upon the type of payor and payment methodologies 
changes in the case mix of the patients as well as payor mix among medicare  medicaid and private pay can significantly affect our profitability 
on july   cms published notice of the fiscal year prospective payment system rates that became effective october  the fiscal year rules provide for a increase in the annual inflation update factor and continue the current payment system with certain payment add ons that were authorized to compensate for non therapy ancillaries 
while no changes were made to the fiscal year rules  cms affirms that its contractor  the urban institute  is expected to complete its study of the skilled nursing payment system in an effort to explore both short term and long term solutions to its case mix methodology 
the study recommendations are expected to be considered as part of the proposed fiscal year rules  effective october  we refer to the anticipated refinement to the resource utilization group classification system as rugs refinement 
although we are unable to predict with certainty the extent of the impact of rugs refinement on our operating results  we believe it could result in a significant reduction in our ebitda 
the medicare modernization act suspended application of the  payment caps therapy caps on medicare part b rehabilitation therapy services through december  the therapy caps in place effective september  imposed payment limits to services provided by independent therapists as well as to those provided by outpatient rehabilitation facilities and other forms of rehabilitation agencies 
the suspension did not have retroactive impact upon medicare beneficiaries who exceeded their caps between september  and december  extension of the moratorium removes a significant financial threat to our therapy business for the short term 
previously  we estimated that the therapy caps would reduce our annual net revenues by approximately million and ebitda by approximately million 
the new law also assures at least a positive increase in the therapy fee schedule through calendar year no assurances can be made or given that congress will extend the moratorium on application of the therapy caps beyond calendar year as mandated by the law  the general accounting office is conducting a study of alternatives to the therapy caps 

back to index state budget pressures in recent years have translated into reductions in the rate of state spending growth in certain jurisdictions 
given that medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets  we expect continuing cost containment pressures on medicaid outlays for skilled nursing facilities in the states in which we operate 
in each of the major states where we provide services  we are working with trade groups  consultants and government officials to address responsibly the particular funding issues 
the plight of state governments has helped to elevate issues related to medicaid onto the national agenda 
in  congress passed temporary relief to states providing a increase in the federal medicaid assistance percentage for five quarters estimated to provide states billion in medicaid relief 
that assistance terminated on june  while legislation has been introduced in both the us senate and us house of representatives  prospects for congress extending the temporary assistance are not encouraging 
actions to date on state medicaid budgets affirm that many states are adjusting downward state medicaid spending to reflect the loss of the temporary federal assistance 
medicaid funding is set annually 
most states have completed formulating their fiscal year budgets 
to date  detailed rate notices from states for fiscal year inpatient nursing home services have been in line with our expectations 
among the alternative medicaid funding approaches that states have explored are nursing home provider assessments as tools for leveraging increased medicaid matching funds 
such initiatives are authorized under the law 
nursing home provider assessments have been implemented in five states where we operate massachusetts  west virginia  rhode island  north carolina and new hampshire 
during june  new state laws were enacted in both new hampshire and new jersey amending previously enacted provider assessment laws to address federal approval concerns 
given successful negotiations with cms  new hampshire has approved its provider assessment program retroactive to may  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million of revenue which increased ebitda by million for the new hampshire provider assessment for the period may  through september  new jersey has submitted for federal government approval a revised state plan amendment 
pennsylvania continues to negotiate with the federal government to resolve items in dispute in their provider assessment submission 
given the on going negotiations between these states and cms  it is not possible to complete an accurate evaluation of the financial impact of these provider assessment proposals 
if enacted  we expect their implementation to have a positive impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
further delays in the federal processing of the pending provider assessment plans in new jersey and pennsylvania could adversely impact future nursing home funding in both jurisdictions 
it is not possible to quantify fully the effect of legislative changes  the interpretation or administration of such legislation or any other governmental initiatives on our business and the business of the customers served by our rehabilitation services business 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the impact of any future healthcare legislation or regulation will not further adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental and private third party payor programs will be timely  will remain at levels similar to present levels or will  in the future  be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to such programs 
our financial condition and results of operations are affected by the reimbursement process  which in the healthcare industry is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the time that revenue is recognized and the time that reimbursement amounts are settled 
results of operations factors affecting comparability of financial information our consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended september  and and for the first two months through november  of the twelve months ended september  have been prepared on a basis which reflects our historical financial statements assuming that the operations of nci contributed in the spin off were organized as a separate legal entity which owned certain net assets of nci 

back to index the allocation methodology followed in preparing the financial statements prior to the december  spin off may not necessarily reflect the results of operations  cash flows or financial position of us in the future  or what the results of operations  cash flows or financial position would have been had we been a separate stand alone public entity for all periods presented 
management believes that the consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended september  is generally comparable to the consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended september  and  with the exception of interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
this lack of comparability is due to the restructuring of our capital following the spin off and the related incremental interest costs and amortization of deferred financing fees in connection with our new financing arrangements 
reasons for non gaap financial information the following discussion includes ebitda and adjusted ebitda which are non gaap financial measures 
for purposes of sec regulation g  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of operations  balance sheet or statement of cash flows or equivalent statements of the registrant  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented 
in this regard  gaap refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
pursuant to the requirements of regulation g  we have provided reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
management believes that the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because they are useful for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business 
we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda primarily as performance measures and believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda is net income 
we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a measure to assess the relative performance of our eldercare properties and other of our operating businesses  as well as the employees responsible for operating such businesses 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense which may vary from business unit to business unit depending upon such factors as the method used to finance the original purchase of the business unit or the tax law in the state that a business unit operates in 
by excluding such factors when measuring financial performance  many of which are outside of the control of the employees responsible for operating our business units  management is better able to evaluate operating performance of the business unit and the employees responsible for business unit performance 
consequently  management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to determine the extent to which our employees have met performance goals  and therefore may or may not be eligible for incentive compensation awards 
we also use ebitda and adjusted ebitda in our annual budget process 
we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda facilitate internal comparisons to historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors historical operating performance 
although we use ebitda as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business  the use of ebitda is limited because it does not consider certain material costs necessary to operate our business 
these costs include the cost to service our debt  the non cash depreciation and amortization associated with our long lived assets  the cost of our federal and state tax obligations  our share of the earnings or losses of our less than owned operations and the operating results of our discontinued businesses 
because ebitda does not consider these important elements of our cost structure  a user of our financial information who relies on ebitda as the only measure of our performance could draw an incomplete or misleading conclusion regarding our financial performance 
consequently  a user of our financial information should consider net income an important measure of our financial performance because it provides the most complete measure of our performance 
we define ebitda as earnings from continuing operations before equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates  minority interests  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
other companies may define ebitda differently and  as a result  our measure of ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda of other companies 
ebitda does not represent net income  as defined by gaap 

back to index adjusted ebitda is presented to exclude certain expenses and gains related to one time transactional events or settlements 
specifically  in fiscal we excluded a net gain recognized in connection with the early extinguishment of a mortgage debt 
in fiscal  we excluded debt restructuring and reorganization costs related to our subsidiaries chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
adjusted ebitda is presented because management uses this information in evaluating the continuing operations of our business and believes that this information provides investors a useful insight into our operating results 
management also believes that excluding such expenses and gains properly reflects our ongoing operations and provides better comparability to prior year results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as substitutes for  or superior to  gaap financial measures or as indicators of operating performance 
reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda year ended september  in thousands net income    add back loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes   equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates  minority interests income tax expense    interest expense    depreciation and amortization expense    ebitda    gain on early extinguishment of debt  debt restructuring and reorganization costs  adjusted ebitda    the gain on early extinguishment of debt is the result of a negotiated discount on a mortgage loan liquidated by us at the request of the mortgage lender 
we excluded this gain on early extinguishment of debt from the calculation of adjusted ebitda because management does not view such a gain as likely to occur in the foreseeable future  nor have we encountered a similar transaction in recent years 
while we often may be interested in extinguishing certain of our mortgage loans by refinancing such loans with senior credit facility borrowings at more favorable rates of interest  because most of these mortgage loans require expensive prepayment penalties  it often is not economically feasible for us to do so 
to have a mortgage lender approach us to extinguish mortgage debt so that we are able to negotiate favorable extinguishment terms is deemed by management to be an unusual event that is reasonably unlikely to occur within the next two years 
the debt restructuring and reorganization costs represents expense specific to our subsidiaries chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
prior to  our subsidiaries were not involved in a chapter proceeding  and the chapter bankruptcy proceedings are deemed by management to be an unusual event that is reasonably unlikely to occur within the next two years 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal revenues were  million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
of this growth  inpatient services revenue increased by million  external rehabilitation therapy services revenue grew million and other businesses revenue declined million 

back to index the million of revenue growth in our inpatient services segment is primarily attributed to increased payor rates and acquisitions 
of the total increase in inpatient services revenue  million is due to step acquisitions of eight eldercare centers  which we previously managed 
we purchased our joint venture partners ownership interests in these eight centers and now own of the operations 
as a result  the revenues and expenses of these centers are included in more periods in our current fiscal year results than in the prior fiscal year 
the balance of the increase in inpatient services revenue is primarily due to increased average rates per patient day 
our average rate per patient day in the current fiscal year was compared to for the prior year 
this increase in the average rate per patient day is principally driven by increased average medicaid rates in versus in and medicare rates per patient day in versus in 
of the million of medicaid rate increases  million resulted from the first time recognition of provider assessment revenue for our new hampshire centers 
the increase in our medicare rate per patient day is attributed to the october  upward medicare rate adjustments of and higher medicare patient acuity 
total patient days increased  to  in the current year compared to  in the prior year 
of this increase   patient days are attributed to the step acquisition of eight eldercare centers discussed above  and  are attributed to the current year having one additional calendar day due to a leap year 
the remaining decline of  patient days is attributed to a decline in the occupancy of our same facility centers which were included in both reporting periods 
our overall occupancy was stable at in compared to in external rehabilitation therapy services revenue increased by million  or 
rehabilitation revenue increases of million from newly signed contracts and million from increased sales volume from existing customer contracts were partially offset by million of lost business and million of decreases in rates charged to existing external customers 
management s decision to curtail the operations of our hospitality services business led to a million decline in other business revenue  with the million balance of the decline in other business revenue primarily resulting from reduced management fee revenue due to the step acquisitions of the eight previously managed properties discussed above 
fiscal net income increased to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
revenue increases of million  as discussed above  were partially offset by million of increased salaries  wages and benefits and million of increased other operating expenses 
of the million of increased salaries  wages and benefits  million is attributed to the step acquisition of the eight eldercare centers  approximately million is attributed to the replacement of higher cost temporary agency nurses with internally employed nurses  with the balance of the increase due to both normal inflationary growth in wage and benefits in our inpatient services segment and disproportionate growth in wage and benefit costs of our rehabilitation therapy services segment 
of the million of increased other operating expenses  million is attributed to the step acquisition of the eight eldercare centers and million is attributed to recognition of new hampshire provider assessment taxes 
these increases were offset by approximately million of reduced costs attributed to the replacement of higher cost temporary agency nurses with internally employed nurses 
the balance of the increase in other operating expenses of approximately million is largely attributed to normal inflationary increases in cost 
net income was further reduced from increases in lease expense  interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense and loss gain on early extinguishment and income tax expense as further discussed below 
net income increased due to lower after tax losses of discontinued operations and higher earnings of less than owned subsidiaries  each of which is further discussed below 
for fiscal  adjusted ebitda was million compared with million in same period of the prior year 
increased adjusted ebitda in the current fiscal year reflects a million increase in the adjusted ebitda of our inpatient services segment due to million of price reductions extended by our rehabilitation therapy services segment to our inpatient services segment  and million due to the step acquisition of eight eldercare centers 
the remaining million adjusted ebitda increase in the inpatient services segment is primarily the result of the previously discussed increase in payor rates and provider assessments  reduced utilization of external nursing agencies and improved pricing for drugs and medical supplies as a result of our post spin off pricing arrangements  offset by inflationary increases in cost 
the inpatient services increase in adjusted ebitda was offset by a decrease of million in the adjusted ebitda of our rehabilitation therapy services segment primarily due to certain contract pricing reductions  including the million of price reductions extended to our inpatient services segment  and million of higher labor related costs 
the increase in rehabilitation therapy labor costs is being driven by high market demand for a limited pool of qualified therapists 
increased loss on early extinguishment of debt in the current year decreased adjusted ebitda by million 
the remaining decrease in adjusted ebitda of million in fiscal is principally attributed to increased general and administrative costs driven by inflationary increases in cost and the incremental cost of operating independently of nci 

back to index capital costs and other lease expense increased by million to million in fiscal from million in the prior year period primarily due to the step acquisitions of three eldercare centers subject to leases 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in fiscal compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is principally attributed to incremental amortization of deferred financing fees following the completion of our new financing arrangements and incremental depreciation expense on information systems following the spin off 
incremental depreciation expense on information systems is due to higher levels of such systems attributed to us from nci in excess of estimated allocations made in the prior year carve out financial statements 
interest expense increased million in fiscal to million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year  principally due to increased debt levels above those allocated in the prior year carve out financial statements resulting from the october issuance of senior subordinated notes in an aggregate principal amount of million and  in december of  our entering into a senior credit facility consisting of a fully drawn million term loan 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal is the result of the early extinguishment of mortgage loans as well as the unscheduled voluntary prepayments of million of the term loan component of our senior credit facility and principally consists of the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees 
the gain on early extinguishment of debt recognized in the prior year is the result of a negotiated discount on a mortgage loan liquidated by us at the request of the mortgage lender 
loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  was million in fiscal and million for the same period in the prior year 
the change is due in part to a million after tax write down of assets classified as discontinued in fiscal compared to million after tax recorded in the prior year period  combined with the relative results of operations of those businesses identified as discontinued operations 
the improvement in the operating results of our discontinued businesses is primarily due to our disposition of certain discontinued operations since the prior year  including the sale of our discontinued florida properties in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year 
income tax expense in fiscal was recorded at an effective tax rate of 
income tax expense in fiscal was offset by the utilization of million of tax losses pursuant to the job creation and worker assistance act of income tax expense in fiscal was otherwise estimated using an effective tax rate of approximately 
the increase in the effective tax rate in the current fiscal year reflects a reduction in employment tax credits due  in large part  to enactment of the working families tax relief act on october  since the law was enacted after our fiscal year end  we could not reflect the benefit of provisions which retroactively extended the credits for wages paid or incurred for eligible new hires in fiscal income tax expense includes the provision of taxes on both equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and minority interests 
operating results of our less than owned subsidiaries in fiscal improved compared to the same period in the prior year  resulting in a combined increase of million in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and minority interests 

back to index fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal revenues were  million  an increase of million  or  over the same period in the prior year 
of this growth  inpatient services revenue increased by million  external rehabilitation therapy services revenue grew million and other businesses revenue declined million 
the million of revenue growth in our inpatient services segment is attributed to a combination of fluctuations in payor rates  occupancy and payor mix  as well as acquisitions 
our average rate per patient day in fiscal was compared to for the comparable period in the prior year 
this overall million increase in the average rate per patient day is principally driven by increased average medicaid rates in versus in  offset by a decline in our average medicare rate per patient day in versus in due to the million net impact of the october  skilled nursing facility medicare cliff 
approximately million of the inpatient services revenue increase resulted from the revenues of four eldercare centers acquired in july such increases were offset by a decrease in revenue of million resulting from an overall decrease in occupancy  partially mitigated by million of increased revenues primarily due to a favorable shift in payor mix 
the favorable shift in payor mix resulted from medicare census representing more of total census in than in total patient days increased  to  in the current fiscal year compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
of this increase   patient days are attributed to the aforementioned four eldercare centers acquired in july  offset by decreased operating census of  patient days as the result of a decline in overall occupancy at our same facility centers  which were included in both reporting periods 
our occupancy was and in fiscals and  respectively 
the million increase in our external rehabilitation therapy services revenue is attributed to the net addition of new contracts  which contributed an additional million of revenues with the remaining million of revenue growth attributed to increased sales volume with existing customers 
management s decision to curtail the operations of our hospitality services business led to a million decline in other business revenue  with the balance of the decline in other business revenue resulting from reduced revenue in our other non core business lines 
in fiscal  net income declined million to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
of this decline  million is attributed to the after tax losses of discontinued operations further discussed below  million is attributed to the impact of reduced medicare reimbursement due to the skilled nursing facility medicare cliff  and million is attributed to increased depreciation and amortization expense further discussed below 
these events  which had a negative impact on net income  were offset by reduced utilization of higher cost nursing agencies used to supplement our employed labor  higher reimbursement rates from non medicare payor sources  a million reduction in debt restructuring and reorganization costs further discussed below and reduced income tax expense as a result of our overall lower profitability and the recognition of million in tax credits in the current fiscal year due to a change in us tax law 
in fiscal  adjusted ebitda was million compared with million in the prior year 
reduced adjusted ebitda in fiscal reflects the million negative impact of the skilled nursing facility medicare cliff  million of increased general and administrative costs  offset by million of ebitda growth generated by our rehabilitation therapy services business 
the increase in general and administrative cost increases is attributed to adverse claims development in our self insured general and professional liability and workers compensation programs  offset by reduced corporate overhead costs as a result of a reduction in force 
capital costs and other depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in fiscal compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is attributed to incremental depreciation expense on capital expenditures made since the prior year in excess of fixed asset retirements  as well as incremental amortization on certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in fiscal in connection with the purchase of a rehabilitation therapy services business 

back to index interest expense was relatively unchanged with a million  or  increase in fiscal to million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year  principally due to a higher weighted average borrowing rate resulting from the incremental costs of derivative financial instruments entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal  offset by reduced interest as a result of having lower levels of indebtedness in fiscal debt restructuring and reorganization costs were million in fiscal as a result of the recognition of approximately million of reorganization costs for post confirmation liabilities payable to the united states trustee related to the chapter proceedings  as well as recording debt restructuring and reorganization costs resulting from a settlement reached with a lender of a pre petition mortgage obligation for an amount that exceeded the estimated loan value established in the september  fresh start balance sheet by approximately million 
the company did not incur any debt restructuring and reorganization costs in fiscal income tax expense in fiscal and fiscal is estimated using an effective tax rate of  offset by the utilization of tax losses of million realized in fiscal pursuant to the job creation and worker assistance act of loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  was million in fiscal and million in the prior fiscal year 
the change is due in part to an million after tax write down of assets classified as discontinued in fiscal compared to million after tax recorded in the prior fiscal year  combined with the relative results of operations of those businesses identified as discontinued operations 
the deterioration in the operating results of our discontinued businesses is attributed to the impact of the skilled nursing facility medicare cliff on such operations and adverse self insured professional liability claims development associated with our discontinued florida properties 
see certain transactions and events assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flows reference to our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows will facilitate understanding of the discussion that follows 
our operating cash flow has been used to finance trade accounts receivable  fund capital expenditures  service our indebtedness and make selective acquisitions 
financing trade accounts receivable is necessary because  on average  the customers and payors for our services do not pay us as quickly as we pay our vendors and employees for their services 
our cash flow from operations for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
the million improvement in cash flow from operations realized in fiscal versus fiscal primarily resulted from million in additional cash flow from accelerated collection of accounts receivable and million in additional cash flow resulting from the timing of payments to vendors and employees 
the remaining million improvement in operating cash flow primarily resulted from growth in operations 
capital expenditures consist primarily of betterments and expansion of eldercare centers and investments in computer hardware and software 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to incur capital expenditure costs at levels significantly above the million incurred in fiscal as we intend to increase our investment in both physical plant and information systems 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are anticipated to be within the range of million to million 
following the spin off  we are highly leveraged and  consequently  a significant portion of our operating cash flow is being used to meet our debt service requirements including payments that will be required under the excess cash flow recapture requirements of our senior credit facility 
see new financing arrangements below 
at the end of each fiscal year  we are required to prepare an excess cash flow calculation as defined in the senior credit agreement 
of the amount determined as excess cash flow  a percentage is to be paid to our senior lenders in the form of a mandatory payment no later than january of each year 
certain of the participating lenders have chosen not to require us to make the mandatory payment 
in november  we paid approximately million under the mandatory payment provisions to those participating lenders that did require such payment 

back to index cash from net investing transactions for fiscal was a net use of cash of million  attributed to million of capital expenditures and a use of cash of million primarily related to the eldertrust ventas transactions 
also in fiscal  we received cash proceeds of million from the sale of three eldercare centers located in the state of wisconsin  the sale of two eldercare centers located in pennsylvania and virginia  and the sale of our diagnostics business 
cash from net financing activities for fiscal was a net source of cash of million  attributed to million of net proceeds from our new financing arrangements  offset by the use of million to repay indebtedness of nci  million to repay mortgage and bond debt of eight eldercare centers  million in voluntary prepayments of the term loan portion of our senior credit facility  million of scheduled principal payments and million of cash transferred to nci in connection with the spin off 
we continually evaluate the most efficient use of our capital  including investments in our property and equipment  information systems  potential asset acquisitions or dispositions  purchasing  refinancing  exchanging or retiring certain of our outstanding debt securities to the extent permitted by our existing covenant restrictions 
as part of such ongoing evaluation  our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock commencing in december share repurchases  if any  may take place at management s discretion and or under pre established  nondiscretionary programs from time to time  depending on market conditions  in the open market  and in privately negotiated transactions 
in addition  in november  we prepaid an fixed rate mortgage having an aggregate principal amount of million 
we paid the lender a million penalty in connection with the prepayment 
we believe that the net cash provided by our operating activities  supplemented as necessary with cash reserves and borrowings available under our new financing arrangements described below will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other short term and long term liquidity needs  including the mandatory debt repayment under the excess cash flow recapture requirement and discretionary repurchases of our common stock noted above 
at september   we had restricted investments in marketable securities of million  which are held by lhc  our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary incorporated under the laws of bermuda 
the investments held by lhc are restricted by statutory capital requirements in bermuda 
as a result of such restrictions and encumbrances  we and lhc are precluded from freely transferring funds through intercompany loans  advances or cash dividends 
new financing arrangements in connection with the spin off  both we and nci entered into new financing arrangements in an effort to extinguish all senior secured joint and several debt and to provide adequate capital to both organizations separately 
in october  we issued senior subordinated notes in an aggregate principal amount of million with a term of ten years 
in april  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission in connection with our offer to exchange the unregistered senior subordinated notes issued in october for registered notes 
in july  upon the expiration of the exchange offer  million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes registered under the securities act of  as amended  were exchanged for the unregistered notes issued in october the aggregate principal amount of million of unregistered notes was not exchanged and remains outstanding 

back to index on december   we entered into a senior credit facility that provides for a term loan of approximately million  which was fully drawn at the consummation of the spin off  and a revolving credit facility of million 
as of december   there was million of available credit under the revolving credit facility after giving effect to million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility 
the term loan has a seven year term and amortizes one percent per year through year six 
the revolving credit facility has a five year term 
our senior credit facility includes an excess cash flow recapture requirement that may increase the required principal payments above contractual minimum amounts each year depending on a defined formula in the senior credit agreement 
the terms under the senior credit facility were amended as of june  such that the interest rate on the term loan portion of our senior credit facility was reduced to the london interbank offered rate libor plus prior to the amendment or a base rate plus an applicable margin 
in addition to this reduction in applicable margin  the amendment provides for further reduction to libor plus if the term loan achieves a rating at or above bb by s p or at or above ba by moody s 
the revolving portion of our senior credit facility has a rate of interest of libor plus or a base rate plus an applicable margin on any borrowings thereunder  and a commitment fee on the revolving portion of on any unused commitment 
during fiscal  we voluntarily prepaid million of the term loan portion of the senior credit facility 
the agreements and instruments governing our new financing arrangements contain various restrictive covenants that  among other things  require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios and restrict our ability to incur more debt  pay dividends  purchase company stock or make other distributions  make certain investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  make acquisitions  merge or consolidate  and transfer or sell assets 
our new financing arrangements require us to maintain compliance with certain financial and non financial covenants  including minimum ebitdar earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and rents  limitations on capital expenditures  maximum leverage ratios  minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and minimum net worth 
under the terms of our senior subordinated notes  the notes are not redeemable until after october  we may  however  use the net proceeds from one or more equity offerings to redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes issued on or before october  at of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  subject to the terms of the notes

we have posted million of outstanding letters of credit 
the letters of credit guarantee performance to third parties of various trade activities 
the letters of credit are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet unless they are probable of being utilized by the third party 
the financial risk approximates the amount of outstanding letters of credit 

back to index we are a party to joint venture partnerships whereby our ownership interests are or less of the total capital of the partnerships 
we account for these partnerships using the equity method of accounting and  therefore  the assets  liabilities and operating results of these partnerships are not consolidated with ours 
the carrying value of our investment in joint venture partnerships is million at september  our share of the income of these partnerships for the years ended september   and was million  million and million  respectively 
although we are not contractually obligated to fund operating losses of these partnerships  in certain cases  we have extended credit to such joint venture partnerships in the past and may decide to do so in the future in order to realize economic benefits from our joint venture relationship 
management assesses the creditworthiness of such partnerships in the same manner it does other third parties 
we have provided million of financial guarantees related to loan commitments of two jointly owned and managed companies 
the guarantees are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet unless we are required to perform under the guarantee 
credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counter parties failed to perform completely as contracted 
the credit risk amounts are equal to the contractual amounts  assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that no amounts could be recovered from other parties 
other commitments on september   we agreed to purchase in january our joint venture partner s interests in a nursing center in the commonwealth of massachusetts

the transaction is anticipated to occur at the end of the current lease term in march we will pay million to purchase the property and make our best efforts to assume approximately million of debt in the transaction 
our ability to exercise this option to purchase is contingent upon the lender s consent for assumption of the debt 
critical accounting policies we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
our critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant  and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
application of the critical accounting policies requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe that the following represents our critical accounting policies
