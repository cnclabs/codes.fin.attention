item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a leading casual dining restaurant company operating o charley s restaurants in states in the southeast and midwest regions  ninety nine restaurants in seven northeastern states  and six stoney river restaurants in the southeast and midwest 
historically  we have grown the o charley s concept by a combination of opening new stores and same store sales growth 
the growth in new stores has typically been in the range year over year 
during  we opened new stores and closed two stores 
this represents an approximate increase over in  we expect to open o charley s restaurants  a growth rate of approximately 
we reduced our growth rate for in order to better focus on our sales building initiatives in our existing restaurants as well as focusing on brand development in new expansion markets 
as we have expanded into new markets outside of our core operating areas  we have experienced sales levels lower than in our core markets 
we believe these lower sales levels are due to a lack of brand awareness and we are taking steps to improve awareness  which we believe will improve our sales and profitability in these new markets 
we are currently strategically evaluating the appropriate level of new unit growth for the o charley s concept that will allow us to maximize long term shareholder value 
according to an industry survey  the casual dining segment within the full service restaurant segment of the us restaurant industry  of which both o charley s and ninety nine are a part  reported average customer visit and same restaurant sales increases during our o charley s restaurants reported declining customer visits of and same restaurant sales decreases of in the lower same restaurant sales at the o charley s restaurants  combined with costs associated with the o charley s restaurants sales building initiatives and higher overall labor costs  resulted in lower than expected financial results during while fiscal was clearly a year that did not meet our sales and earnings objectives  there were several significant events that occurred 
we took significant steps to reverse the declining trend in customer visits at o charley s restaurants  we acquired the ninety nine restaurant and pub concept  we restructured our balance sheet providing a more flexible  long term capital structure  and we announced the signing of our first o charley s franchisee 
following is an overview of these important events to facilitate a better understanding of the discussion and analysis that follows 
o charley s sales building plan prior to  we consistently reported annual increases in same restaurant sales and customer visits at o charley s 
in the second fiscal quarter of  we began to experience decreases in customer visits at our o charley s restaurants  which eventually led to declines in same restaurant sales 
the decrease in customer visits at o charley s continued through the first two quarters of fiscal based on our analysis of marketing research  impact meetings with co workers and customer focus group results  we believe the customer visit declines occurred in part because our price to value relationship diminished for our value conscious customers  and certain service initiatives introduced during negatively impacted our customers experience 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we initiated a three phase plan intended to increase our sales and customer visits at our o charley s restaurants 
during the first phase  we improved the price value relationship with a new multi colored menu  introducing the pick two and pick three combo promotions and a price decrease on certain menu items 
additionally  we made improvements to our store atmosphere and increased our service levels 
each of these actions significantly increased customer visits but adversely affected operating margins due primarily to the better than expected customer response to the lower margin combo promotions 
during phase two  which occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we introduced certain higher margin items to the menu and increased the prices on the pick two and pick three combos 
prior to implementing these two phases  customer visits were down on average to as compared to the same prior year period 
subsequent to implementing these initiatives  customer visits increased on average approximately through the end of fiscal over the same prior year period 
while customer visits improved  the overall check average declined approximately to during the same period  resulting in same restaurant sales at o charley s declining to during the period of these sales building initiatives 
in addition  these initiatives negatively impacted our margins in the third and fourth quarters of during the first quarter of  we have introduced the third phase of our sales building initiatives which is designed to maintain the customer visit momentum established in  while improving the overall check average and same restaurant sales 
we expect phase three to be longer in term and broader in scope than the prior two phases  which lasted approximately four months 
we believe the third phase will broaden our customer base  appeal to core customers and improve our margins 
while these initiatives are currently meeting our expectations  there can be no assurance they will result in a sustained improvement in customer visits or in same restaurant sales 
acquisition of ninety nine we believe the intense competitive nature of the restaurant business has been  and will continue to be  an impetus for industry consolidation 
we believe multi concept operators with significant financial and physical resources will be better positioned to leverage advertising and support services  fully penetrate and establish brand dominance in specific geographic regions and reduce profit variations during weak economic times 
in january  we completed the acquisition of ninety nine restaurant and pub  a woburn  massachusetts based casual dining concept with locations 
table of contents in seven northeastern states 
we acquired ninety nine for million in cash and approximately million shares of common stock  plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
while the acquisition of ninety nine was substantially larger than any we have previously completed  we met our overall financial  operational and integration goals at ninety nine during see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the acquisition of ninety nine 
financing arrangements in conjunction with the acquisition of ninety nine  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility  comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
this credit facility remained in place through the first four weeks of the fourth fiscal quarter of  at which time we refinanced our capital structure in order to reduce our balance sheet leverage  reduce our exposure to interest rate risk and provide a more flexible  long term capital structure to support our overall business strategy 
to that end  during the fourth quarter we amended and restated our credit facility to a million revolving credit facility and issued million of unsecured  senior subordinated notes due the proceeds from the notes offering were used to repay the million term loan balance and to repay a portion of the revolving credit loan 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we repaid certain amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale and lease back of o charley s restaurant properties 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding these arrangements 
o charley s franchising during december  we entered into an exclusive multi unit development agreement with meritage hospitality group to develop and operate up to new o charley s restaurants in michigan 
meritage hospitality appointed roger zingle  a year veteran of the restaurant industry  as its president and chief operating officer of o charley s of michigan 
we intend to enter into additional development agreements to franchise our o charley s concept in other areas 
we will continue to experience expenditures and losses in implementing our franchising initiative until such time  if ever  that we generate sufficient franchising revenue to cover these expenditures 
following is an explanation of certain items in the company s consolidated statement of earnings revenues consist of restaurant sales and  to a lesser extent  commissary sales 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes 
commissary sales represent sales to outside parties consisting primarily of sales of o charley s branded food items  primarily salad dressings  to retail grocery chains  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
cost of food and beverage primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  produce and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
we believe our menus offer a broad selection of menu items and as a result there is not a high concentration of our food costs in any one product category 
generally  temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to customers  however  we have in the past generally adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities including restaurant management salaries and bonuses  hourly wages for restaurant level employees  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay 
we have an incentive bonus plan that compensates restaurant management for achieving and exceeding certain restaurant level financial targets and performance goals 
restaurant operating costs include occupancy and other expenses at the restaurant level  except property and equipment depreciation and amortization 
supplies  rent  supervisory salaries  bonuses and related expenses  management training salaries  general liability and property insurance  property taxes  utilities  repairs and maintenance  outside services and credit card fees account for the major expenses in this category 
advertising  general and administrative expenses include all advertising and home office administrative functions that support the existing restaurant base and provide the infrastructure for future growth 
advertising  executive management and support staff salaries  bonuses and related expenses  data processing  legal and accounting expenses and office expenses account for the major expenses in this category 

table of contents depreciation and amortization primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
for periods prior to december   depreciation and amortization also includes amortization of goodwill  which related primarily to the acquisition of the stoney river concept 
in accordance with sfas no 
 beginning december   we no longer amortize goodwill 
preopening costs include operating costs and expenses incurred prior to a new restaurant opening 
the amount of preopening costs incurred in any one period includes costs incurred during the period for restaurants opened and under development 
our preopening costs may vary significantly from quarter to quarter primarily due to the timing of restaurant openings 

table of contents the following information should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the following table reflects our operating results for   and as a percentage of total revenues unless otherwise indicated 
all fiscal years presented were comprised of weeks

see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal as if sfas no 
had been adopted at the beginning of fiscal 
table of contents the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial and other restaurant data relating to company restaurants number of restaurants o charley s restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants opened restaurant closed in operation  end of year ninety nine restaurants restaurants acquired restaurants opened restaurants closed in operation  end of year stoney river restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants opened in operation  end of year average weekly sales per restaurant o charley s ninety nine stoney river change in same restaurant sales o charley s ninety nine stoney river change in customer visits o charley s average check o charley s ninety nine stoney river when computing same restaurant sales and customer visits  restaurants open for at least weeks are compared from period to period 
change in customer visits is not available for ninety nine and stoney river 

table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues during  total revenues increased million  or  primarily related to the inclusion of million of sales from the operations of ninety nine restaurants since we acquired that concept on january  excluding the revenues of the ninety nine restaurants  revenues increased million  or 
o charley s restaurant sales increased million  or  as a result of the net addition of restaurants during  comprised of new restaurants opened and the closure of two restaurants 
same restaurant sales for the o charley s restaurants decreased in as compared to  due principally to a decline in the number of customer visits 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we implemented sales building initiatives that improved customer visits at the o charley s restaurants during the third and fourth quarters of but adversely affected operating margins 
sales at our o charley s restaurants were negatively affected in fiscal when customers and employees at one of our o charley s restaurants were exposed to the hepatitis a virus 
see legal proceedings 
we believe that the hepatitis a incident adversely affected sales at our nine knoxville  tennessee area restaurants during the fourth quarter of by approximately as compared to the same prior year period and adversely affected o charley s same restaurant sales and customer visits for the fourth quarter by approximately basis points 
although comparable sales at our knoxville area restaurants have improved sequentially since the outbreak was first publicized  we expect the negative publicity surrounding the hepatitis a incident will continue to adversely affect sales at our o charley s restaurants in ninety nine restaurant sales were million for the period since its acquisition on january  same restaurant sales for ninety nine restaurants were up for  compared with stoney river restaurant sales increased million  or  due primarily to full year effect of the three new restaurants opened in  same restaurant sales increases of in as compared to and higher sales volumes at new restaurants 
cost of food and beverage beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through the end of  cost of food and beverage increased as a percentage of restaurant sales compared to the same prior year period as commodity costs  primarily the cost of red meat  poultry and lettuce  increased as compared to the same prior year period 
in addition to the higher commodity costs  the sales building initiatives we implemented during the third fiscal quarter of at our o charley s restaurants included promotions of lower priced items  and a price reduction on certain menu items  both of which increased our food cost as a percentage of restaurant sales 
more recently  the cost of red meat has become erratic as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse was confirmed in a dairy cow in washington in december it appears that domestic consumer reaction was muted from this event and consumer beef demand has remained relatively strong 
overall beef costs have declined since the discovery of bse due to various factors including the reduction in beef exports 
following the bse discovery  avian influenza ai in broiler flocks has been reported in a number of asian countries 
some international consumers reacted to the finding of ai by increasing imports of us poultry products after banning imports from these asian countries 
this change in us poultry export demand drove prices sharply higher 
however  more recently there were broiler flocks in the united states that tested positive for ai  causing the higher prices to moderate as a number of major importers have placed bans on imports from the united states pending additional test results of these flocks 
we are unable to predict the repercussions of the bse and ai discoveries on consumer demand and commodity costs 
during the first quarter of  we expect commodity costs will average to higher compared to the same prior year period due principally to higher poultry and red meat costs 
for fiscal  however  we expect commodity costs to moderate to average to higher compared to the same prior year period due principally to higher poultry costs  offset by flat to slightly lower red meat costs 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  governmental regulation  production  availability  recalls of food products and seasonality  may affect our commodity costs 
we also expect to continue to realize improvements in our meat yields of approximately at our new commissary meat facility that has been in operation since the third quarter of we believe our expected yield improvement for equates to an estimated red meat cost savings of approximately million 

table of contents payroll and benefits during  we improved the insurance benefits offered to o charley s and stoney river hourly employees to enable us to attract and retain the most qualified candidates available 
these improvements resulted in a million  or basis point  increase in our payroll and benefits costs and expenses in in addition to the improved insurance benefits  payroll and benefit costs increased as a percent of restaurant sales in as a result of the higher average wage rates for the ninety nine managers and hourly co workers  lower average weekly sales at o charley s  which increased the percentage of fixed payroll costs  and increased service levels we introduced with the sales building plan at o charley s 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in restaurant level bonus expense 
restaurant management compensation is based  in part  on restaurant sales and profitability  and since both were below our annual targets we paid less bonus compensation during restaurant operating costs restaurant operating costs increased in primarily due to the higher base of restaurants that are leased by ninety nine  and to higher utility costs  primarily natural gas from increased usage due to inclement winter weather in the first quarter of and rate increases through the year 
these increases were partially offset by lower supervisory bonus expense in compared to the same prior year period 
restaurant supervisor compensation is based  in part  on restaurant sales and profitability  and since both were below our annual targets we paid less bonus compensation during during  we completed sale and lease back transactions pursuant to which we sold o charley s restaurant properties for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we completed transactions involving the sale of six additional o charley s restaurant properties for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the leases that we have entered into in connection with the million sale and lease back transactions will require us to expense on a straight line basis approximately million annually  including the amortization of the million deferred gain  over the year lease term 
we may enter into an additional sale and lease back transaction before the end of the first fiscal quarter of pursuant to which we may sell and lease back up to seven o charley s restaurant properties for estimated aggregate gross proceeds of million 
we cannot assure you  however  that this proposed sale and lease back transaction will be completed or  if we do complete this transaction  that the terms will not differ  perhaps significantly  from those reflected in this report 
we expect the recently completed million of sale and lease back transactions and  if completed  the proposed million sale and lease back transaction will increase rent expense by approximately million on an annual basis  including the amortization of the related deferred gain over the lease term 
for the first fiscal quarter of  we expect to have approximately million of additional net rent expense from these sale and lease back transactions 
advertising  general and administrative expenses in  advertising expenditures increased to million from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  declined to in from in the increase in advertising was primarily due to the acquisition of ninety nine and as part of the sales building initiatives at o charley s 
advertising expenditures were lower  as a percentage of revenues  as ninety nine spends less on advertising as a percent of restaurant sales compared to o charley s restaurants 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in during the first fiscal quarter of  we adopted a deferred compensation plan for the senior management of ninety nine that increased general and administrative costs 
in addition  we incurred incremental costs  primarily in salaries and related expenses  associated with operating multiple concepts  which increased general and administrative expenses 
these increases were offset primarily by a decrease in bonus expense 
executive and senior management compensation is based  in part  on company sales and profitability  and since both were below our annual targets we paid less bonus compensation during depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ninety nine  which leases all of its restaurants 
during  we will have less depreciation expense as a result of no longer depreciating the o charley s properties included in the recently 
table of contents completed million sale and lease back transactions and  if completed  the approximately seven o charley s properties included in the proposed million sale and lease back transaction 
preopening costs in  preopening costs declined as a percentage of total revenues due primarily to lower average cost for each new restaurant opening in as compared to currently  we incur average preopening costs of approximately  for each new o charley s and stoney river restaurant and approximately  for each new ninety nine restaurant 
interest expense interest expense increased in primarily due to increased borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition of ninety nine coupled with higher average interest rates under our credit facility 
income taxes our income tax rate in was which is lower than the income tax rate in the previous two years 
this income tax rate reduction occurred primarily because of higher income tax credits  primarily fica tip credits  relative to the lower than expected earnings 
the tax credits increased as expected in while pre tax earnings decreased in for the first quarter of  we currently expect the income tax rate to be in the mid to high range 
diluted weighted shares the increase in diluted weighted shares relates primarily to the shares issued and committed to be issued in connection with the acquisition of ninety nine 
we issued approximately  shares at the closing of the acquisition   shares on the first anniversary and will issue the remaining approximately million shares over the next five years 
since the remaining shares to be issued are not contingent on any future event other than the passage of time  they are included in the weighted share calculations 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues total revenues increased million  or  primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales of million  or 
the increase in restaurant sales was attributable to the net addition of o charley s restaurants  three new stoney river restaurants opened in and a same restaurant sales increase for the stoney river concept  partially offset by a same restaurant sales decline at our o charley s restaurants 
the overall check average for the o charley s concept was in compared to in customer visits at our o charley s restaurants decreased approximately during fiscal during the second quarter of  we implemented a value menu promotion at o charley s in response to the slowing economy  which lowered the price of certain entrees 
we believe this promotion generated positive customer visits and lowered our average check in we believe our customer visits were lower in  in part  as a result of not having a similar value promotion in during the third quarter of  we increased menu prices by approximately in approximately two thirds of our o charley s restaurants 
during the fourth quarter of  we introduced a new menu in all of our o charley s restaurants that included a menu price increase of approximately for the remaining one third of our restaurants that had not taken the menu price increase during the third quarter of we believe the increase in our check average was the result of the combination of the menu price increase taken in and the absence of a value promotion in similar to the one in the increase in same restaurant sales at our stoney river restaurants resulted from an increase in check average  partially offset by a decrease in customer visits 
cost of food and beverage during  cost of food and beverage decreased as a percent of restaurant sales primarily related to an overall reduction in the cost of certain food items and continued improvements in operating efficiencies at our restaurants and commissary 
we experienced lower costs in red meat  pork  poultry and dairy costs  partially offset by increases in certain produce costs 

table of contents payroll and benefits payroll and benefits expense in declined slightly as a percent of restaurant sales compared to  due to lower restaurant level bonuses and workers compensation expenses  offset by a modest increase in hourly wage rates and increased salaries for restaurant management in restaurant operating costs restaurant operating costs remained relatively flat as a percent of restaurant sales in in  we experienced higher overall restaurant occupancy and operating costs due primarily to increases in repair and maintenance cost  general liability insurance and credit card fees partially offset by lower utility costs compared to we also experienced a decrease in supervisory expenses in as a percentage of total restaurant sales due primarily to lower management training salaries 
advertising  general and administrative expenses advertising expenditures increased to million in from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in the increase in advertising expenditures was in response to the continued weakness of the us economy 
an increase in television costs represented the primary share of the overall increase in advertising expenditures 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased bonus expenses and integration costs associated with the acquisition of ninety nine partially offset by lower legal costs 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization increased slightly in  due primarily to new restaurants opened in and capital expenditures for improvements to existing restaurants  which offset the lack of goodwill amortization in preopening costs the decline in preopening costs in as a percent of total revenues was primarily attributable to lower average cost per restaurant opening in compared to interest expense interest expense decreased in as a result of overall lower interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on our revolving credit facility decreased to in as compared with in due to lower short term libor rates in in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of our evaluation of the goodwill carrying value of the stoney river reporting unit 

table of contents quarterly financial and restaurant operating data the following is a summary of certain unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the last three fiscal years 
for accounting purposes  the first quarter consists of weeks and the second  third and fourth quarters each consist of weeks 
as a result  some of the variations reflected in the following table are attributable to the different lengths of the fiscal quarters 
first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter dollars in thousands  except per share data revenues income from operations net earnings basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share restaurants in operation  end of quarter revenues income from operations net earnings basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share restaurants in operation  end of quarter revenues income from operations net earnings basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share restaurants in operation  end of quarter on january   the company acquired ninety nine restaurant and pub for million in cash and approximately million shares of common stock 
ninety nine operated restaurants at january  the earnings above include the earnings of ninety nine for the period from january  through december  the company incurred an after tax charge of million  or per diluted share  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of fiscal associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the charge was related to the write off of goodwill associated with the stoney river acquisition in may during the third quarter of  management decided to close five restaurants 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of to reflect the differences between the fair value and net book value of the assets  and a charge of  for exit costs associated with the closure of such locations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  capitalized lease obligations and sales of common stock 
our principal capital needs have historically arisen from property and equipment additions  acquisitions  and payments on long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
in addition  we lease a substantial number of our restaurants under operating leases  as described below  and have substantial operating lease obligations 
our working capital historically has had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to cash reinvestments in long term assets  mostly property and equipment additions  which we do not believe indicates a lack of liquidity 
on january   we completed the acquisition of ninety nine restaurant and pub for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock  plus the assumption of certain liabilities of ninety nine 
of the stock portion of the purchase price  we delivered approximately  shares at closing   shares on the first anniversary of the closing  and will deliver approximately  on each of the second and third anniversaries of the closing and  shares on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the closing 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ninety nine  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility  comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan  to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of ninety nine  repay the previous revolving credit facility and provide capital for future growth 
this credit facility remained in place through the first four weeks of the fourth quarter of and was secured by all our tangible and intangible assets and the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility had outstanding borrowings of million at october   which accrued interest at a rate of libor plus 
the term loan balance at the end of the third quarter of was million  which accrued interest at a rate of libor plus 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility at the end of the third quarter of was  compared to at the end of the same prior year period 
in the fourth quarter of  we amended and restated our credit facility and issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured  senior subordinated notes due the proceeds from the note offering were used to repay the term loan and to repay a portion of the revolving credit loan under our bank credit facility 
interest on the notes accrues at a fixed rate of and is payable semi annually on may and november of each year commencing may  the notes mature on november  the notes are unsecured  senior subordinated obligations and rank junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
at any time before november   we may redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  with the cash proceeds of certain equity offerings 
we may also redeem all or a portion of the notes on or after november  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the notes 
the notes are guaranteed on an unsecured  senior subordinated basis by certain of our subsidiaries 
our current bank credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility in a maximum principal amount of million 
the facility has a four year term maturing in  and bears interest  at our option  at either libor plus a specified margin ranging from to based on certain financial ratios or the base rate  which is the higher of the lender s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus  plus a specified margin from to based on certain financial ratios 
the credit facility imposes restrictions on us with respect to the incurrence of additional indebtedness  sales of assets  mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures  investments  repurchases of stock and the payment of dividends 
in addition  the credit facility requires us to comply with certain specified financial covenants  including covenants and ratios relating to our senior secured leverage  maximum adjusted leverage  minimum fixed charge coverage  minimum asset coverage and maximum capital expenditures 
the credit facility contains certain events of default  including an event of default resulting from certain changes in control 
at december   the credit facility was secured by all of the tangible and intangible assets and capital stock of the company as of the date of the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with such covenants at december  during the fourth quarter of  we also completed two sale and lease back transactions 
the first transaction  completed on october   involved the sale of of our o charley s restaurant properties for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the second transaction  completed on november   involved the sale of five of our o charley s restaurants for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
during the first quarter of 
table of contents  we completed a transaction involving the sale of six of our o charley s restaurants for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
all of these sales were made to an unrelated entity who then leased the properties back to us 
the leases that we entered into in connection with these transactions require us to make additional future minimum lease payments aggregating approximately million over the year term of the leases  or an average of approximately million annually 
the leases also provide for the payment of additional rent beginning in the sixth year of the lease term based on increases in the consumer price index 
the net proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down indebtedness under our bank credit facility 
we may enter into an additional sale and lease back transaction totaling aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million in we plan to use the proceeds from these transactions  if completed  to reduce indebtedness under our credit facility 
we cannot assure you that this proposed sale and lease back transaction will be completed or  if we do complete this transaction  the terms will not differ  perhaps substantially  from those of the recently completed transactions described above 
from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions 
these swap agreements may effectively convert some of our obligations that bear interest at variable rates into fixed rate obligations and may convert some of our obligations that bear interest at fixed rates into variable interest rate obligations 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  which effectively fixed the interest rate on million of our outstanding variable rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the corresponding floating rates of interest received on those notional amounts are based on one month libor rates and are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our credit facility 
the swap agreement with respect to million of our indebtedness expired in january the swap agreement relating to the remaining million of our indebtedness expires in january during the first quarter of  we entered into additional interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively convert a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to the senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps was million and is based on the six month libor rate in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on our senior subordinated notes due these swap agreements expire in january in october  we announced an authorization to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
any repurchases will be made from time to time in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion 
to date  we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this authorization 
any repurchases will be funded with borrowings under our bank credit facility 
net cash flows used by investing activities in included approximately million cash paid for the acquisition of ninety nine  net of cash acquired  capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants  a new usda inspected meat facility at our nashville commissary and technological improvements at our home office 
capital expenditures were million in  excluding million of new restaurant equipment financed through capitalized lease obligations  compared to million in and million in during  we paid approximately million in debt issuance costs  which will be amortized over the matching term of the related debt instrument 
our capital budget includes approximately million to million for capital expenditures  excluding new restaurant equipment financed through capitalized lease obligations 
these expenditures are for an estimated additional o charley s restaurants  to additional ninety nine restaurants  up to two additional stoney river restaurants  and improvements to existing restaurants and the commissary and home office additions 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures for will not vary significantly from budgeted amounts based upon a number of factors  including the timing of additional purchases of restaurant sites and the opening of new restaurants 
payments on long term debt were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
included in the long term debt payments is million associated with outstanding balances under credit facilities that were refinanced with the above mentioned financing sources

we have historically produced insufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital and capital expenditures and  accordingly  our ability to meet our anticipated capital needs is dependent on our ability to continue to access external financing  particularly borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions or strategic joint ventures 
any acquisitions  joint ventures or other growth opportunities may require additional external financing 
there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to us or that any such financing would not negatively impact our earnings

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows property and equipment excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill and trademarks impairment of long lived assets property and equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line method over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected value 
table of contents at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a store operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill and trademarks as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets 
beginning in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
at december   we have million in goodwill and million in indefinite life intangible assets shown in our consolidated balance sheet related to the acquisition of ninety nine restaurant and pub 
the determination of the estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to successfully integrate the ninety nine concept and to maintain the financial performance that this concept has experienced over its recent history 
changes in strategy  new accounting pronouncements and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
for example  we incurred an after tax charge of million  or per diluted share  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of fiscal associated with the adoption of sfas no 
the charge was related to the goodwill associated with the stoney river acquisition 
as discussed earlier  on january   we acquired ninety nine restaurant and pub for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
we completed a valuation of the assets and liabilities of ninety nine and allocated the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  including million related to trademarks  with the remaining amount of million being allocated to goodwill 
we selected the first day of each new fiscal year as the date on which we will test the goodwill and trademarks for impairment 
we completed a valuation of the goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
as of december   the first day of fiscal and our valuation showed that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its net book value and no impairment charge was needed 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset 
table of contents to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development of a given market within which a store operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the store efficiently and effectively 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  which is the level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in earnings on a timely basis 
other accounting matters as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we account for our stock option plans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas encourages all entities to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock compensation plans  whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
however  sfas no 
also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principle board opinion no 
apb  whereby compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock on the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we currently apply the provisions of apb to account for our stock option plans 
stock options issued to date pursuant to our stock options plans have had no intrinsic value at the grant date  and under opinion no 
 no compensation cost is recognized for them 
we have provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements pro forma net earnings and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in and subsequent years as if the fair value based method defined in sfas had been applied 
as of december   we had options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock outstanding at an average exercise price of per share 
the financial accounting standards board is considering changes to the accounting model for stock based compensation 
in the event that accounting rules associated with stock options were to change to require all entities to expense the fair value of stock options granted  our consolidated statement of earnings would be adversely impacted 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no  rescission of fasb statements nos 
 and  amendments of fasb statement no  and technical corrections 
sfas no 
amends existing guidance on reporting gains and losses on the extinguishments of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain or loss as extraordinary  as the use of such extinguishments have become part of the risk management strategy of many companies 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to require sale and leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale and leaseback transactions 
the provisions of the statement related to the rescission of statement no 
is applied in fiscal years beginning after may  earlier application of these provisions is encouraged 
the provisions of the statement related to statement no 
were effective for transactions occurring after may  with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to our million bank credit facility 
the charge was reflected as a component of other income expense in our consolidated statement of earnings 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities 
table of contents that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no  consolidation of variable interest entities  and interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in any entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference be between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
we continue to evaluate the impact  if any  that fin r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
on may   the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some circumstances three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer 
generally  the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period ending after december  we adopted the provisions of the statement on july  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land and construction costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly employees 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we currently utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized leases and our variable rate debt consists of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our credit facility  at certain times we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we receive a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
the fixed interest rates are dependent upon market levels at the time the swaps are consummated 
the floating interest rates are generally based on the monthly libor rate and rates are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had in effect million in swaps at an average fixed rate of  million of which matured in january and million of which matures in january during the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution 
these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to our million senior subordinated notes into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps was million and is based on six month libor rates in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on the notes 
these swap agreements expire in january
