the company s hard disk drives are used in desktop pcs  enterprise servers  network attached storage devices  an expanding list of ce products such as video game consoles  personal digital video recorders and satellite and cable set top boxes  and as external storage devices 
western digital markets its hard disk drives directly to pc manufacturers  including large  brand name pc manufacturers such as dell and hewlett packard  to ce manufacturers  and to distributors  resellers and retailers that serve a wide range of end users 
unless otherwise noted  all references to market share and industry data included in this discussion are according to the gartner report published in april of western digital builds hard disk drives in assembly facilities in malaysia and thailand 
the company also builds hard disk drive components such as printed circuit board assemblies and head stack assemblies in its malaysia and thailand facilities 
in july  the company acquired head manufacturing facilities in california and thailand  and currently produces a significant portion of its head requirements 
western digital procures other components from industry leading technology companies  many of which work with the company from design and development through manufacturing 
currently  eight hard disk drive vendors compete in the billion a year hard disk drive market  compared to fifteen vendors in calendar year according to gartner quarterly reports published in and calendar year  western digital  seagate technology  maxtor corporation  and hitachi global storage technologies supplied approximately of the total hard disk drive market during the company focuses on providing quality products  superior customer service and flexibility by managing its technology deployment  manufacturing  cost  delivery  quality and reliability 
western digital believes that its low cost business model allows it to access leading edge component technologies and cost saving innovations while minimizing investment expenditures 
western digital s growth will be influenced greatly by developments in the pc hard disk drive market 
gartner estimates that unit shipments of hard disk drives in the desktop pc market will grow by approximately per year through calendar year the company has increased its resources to address certain fast growing geographic markets such as asia  latin america  eastern europe and russia 
the company s revenue in asia during increased to of total revenue as compared to of total revenue for gartner estimates that demand for desktop pc hard disk drives in asia will increase per year through calendar year because ce demand for hard disk drives is relatively new  with many consumer applications currently employing similar hard disk drive technology as is found in desktop pcs  western digital presently believes it can expand shipments into this developing market 
as this market develops  additional investments by the company may be required 
gartner estimates that unit shipments of inch form factor hard disk drives in ce markets will grow by approximately per year through calendar year the company is also pursuing new revenue opportunities in non pc  information technology it applications through its application of the sata interface 
the sata interface contains many of the same benefits of scsi the predominant interface currently used in most enterprise hard disk drive applications at a lower cost 
trendfocus estimates that of enterprise hard disk drive unit shipments will use the eide or sata interface by calendar year in addition to the ce and sata growth opportunities  the company has plans to enter the mobile hard disk drive market in calendar year to provide hard disk drives for notebook pcs 
gartner forecasts that unit sales of inch form factor hard disk drives to the mobile computing market will grow from an estimated million in calendar year to approximately million in calendar year  reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 

table of contents fiscal overview according to quarterly reports for and calendar year from gartner  the desktop hard disk drive market increased by approximately based on unit shipments 
based on quarterly reports published by gartner in and calendar  the company believes that its market share in desktop hard disk drives increased to from in while western digital s unit shipments grew by in  the average selling price of its hard disk drives declined by due to aggressive pricing pressures and mix of products 
in  western digital s net revenue increased by  to billion  on unit shipments of million 
however  in  gross margin decreased to from in primarily as a result of aggressive pricing pressures 
in addition  the company incurred approximately million of start up expenses and other charges related to the acquisition of substantially all the assets of read rite corporation read rite in july these factors offset the ongoing positive contribution of the company s newly acquired head manufacturing operations 
as a result  operating income decreased by million  to million  and operating margins decreased to as a percentage of net revenue  compared with in for  the company expects incremental benefits from its integrated head operations  however  it is not clear whether this will be enough to offset any continued downward pressure on gross margin caused by competitive pricing 
western digital generated million in cash flow from operations in and finished the year with million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from the prior year s balance 
read rite asset acquisition in june  read rite  then one of the company s suppliers of magnetic recording heads  commenced voluntary chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
on july   western digital purchased substantially all of the assets of read rite  including its wafer fabrication equipment in fremont  california and manufacturing facility in bang pa in  thailand 
the cost of the acquisition was million and consisted of cash consideration of million  assumed debt obligations of the thailand operations of approximately million  direct costs of the acquisition and other miscellaneous assumed obligations totaling million 
proceeds from a million term loan were used to repay obligations assumed as a result of the acquired head manufacturing operations in thailand 
western digital s acquisition of the head manufacturing operations represented a fundamental change in the company s operating structure as the company is now manufacturing heads for use in its hard disk drives 
previously  the company purchased all of its recording head requirements from external suppliers  including read rite 
the company acquired the read rite assets for the following reasons to enhance its financial business model  to gain better control of head technology as the company s business grows  to improve flexibility  product planning and quality  and to improve its cost structure and tighten its supply chain through better operational integration 
taking the asset acquisition into consideration  the company expects its long term financial business model to benefit from a higher gross margin percentage  offset by higher research and development expenses  than it otherwise would have had without the acquisition 
the gross margin percentage improvement will result from lower cost of sales  as the company develops the ability to manufacture heads at a lower cost than what it would have otherwise paid external suppliers 
this is expected to result in higher operating income than it otherwise would have had without the acquisition 
the company began realizing these net financial benefits in however  these benefits were offset by downward pressures on gross margins caused by an aggressive pricing environment 
the incremental benefits from an integrated head manufacturing operation are expected to increase as the company continues to ramp its head manufacturing capability 
the company is currently satisfying a substantial portion of its head requirements through its own head manufacturing operations 
as a result of integrating the head manufacturing operations  the company carries a higher percentage of fixed costs than assumed in its prior financial business model 
for example  depreciation expense for the head manufacturing operations is expected to be between million and million per quarter by the end of 
table of contents capital expenditures and working capital investments required to support the head manufacturing operations will increase when compared to the company s prior financial business model 
for example  capital expenditures related to the head manufacturing operations are expected to average between million and million on an annual basis after initial capital investments are completed 
also  inventory turns are expected to decrease to between and from the company s historical average of between and the company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition 
the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows current assets property and equipment purchased technology in process research and development as of the date of the acquisition  read rite had two in process research and development ipr d projects gigabyte per platter and gigabyte per platter products 
the fair value allocated to these projects as part of the acquisition was million and million  respectively 
the multi period excess earnings method  a discounted cash flow income approach  was used to determine the value allocated to the ipr d 
the rate utilized to discount the cash flows to their present values was based on the weighted average cost of capital and an additional risk premium based on an analysis of the technology and the ipr d stages of completion 
based on these factors  was used as the annual discount rate 
these acquired ipr d projects had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the company recorded the million as a charge to research and development expense at the time of the acquisition

critical accounting policies the company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the company has adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates 
the company believes the following are its most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve management s judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue and accounts receivable in accordance with standard industry practice  the company has agreements with resellers that provide price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions 
in addition  the company may have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation on slow moving items and other incentive programs 
in accordance with current accounting standards  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers 
adjustments are based on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period  estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers  as well as historical pricing information 
if end market demand for hard disk drives declines significantly  the company may have to increase sell through incentive payments to resellers  resulting in an increase in price protection allowances  which could adversely impact operating results 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  the company routinely analyzes the different receivable aging categories and its bad debt loss history and establishes reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses 
if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due  an increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts would be required  which could negatively affect operating results 
the company records provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
the company bases these provisions on existing product return notifications as well as historical returns by product type see warranty 
if actual sales returns exceed expectations  an increase in the sales return provision would be required  which could negatively affect operating results 
warranty the company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized 
warranty covers costs of repair or replacement of the hard disk drive over the warranty period  which generally ranges from one to five years 
the company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for warranty  which include specific detail on hard disk drives in the field by product type  historical field return rates and costs to repair 
if actual product return rates or costs to repair returned products increase above expectations  an increase in the warranty provision would be required  which could negatively affect operating results 

table of contents inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
inventory write downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 
the company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information  and writes down inventory balances for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis 
unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the company s products  which may require an increase in inventory write downs that could negatively affect operating results 
litigation and other contingencies the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies 
accordingly  the company accrues loss contingencies when management  in consultation with its legal advisors  concludes that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable
