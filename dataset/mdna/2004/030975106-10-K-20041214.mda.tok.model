executive summary amerigas partners  the largest retail propane marketer in the united states  achieved record financial results during fiscal this year s increase in net income per unit reflects the benefits realized from the partnership s growth and expense containment strategies 
the partnership was able to achieve these results notwithstanding warmer than normal weather and a high product cost environment 
weather and product cost volatility are risks that face all competitors in this industry 
the propane industry is mature  with residential customer growth estimated to be approximately 
given the industry s maturity  the partnership s growth strategy focuses on acquisition of other propane marketers and internal growth achieved by exploiting its geographical coverage and by offering superior customer service 
during fiscal  weather was warmer than normal and our product costs increased approximately compared to the prior year 
the partnership s earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda grew to million compared to fiscal the negative effects of warmer winter weather and price induced customer conservation on propane volumes were partially offset by volume growth from acquisitions and growth in our prefilled propane xchange r ppx program  strategic accounts and the base business 
the partnership managed its margins effectively during a year of rising propane product costs while experiencing the benefits on operating expenses of the management realignment completed in late fiscal in fiscal and beyond  the partnership will continue to focus on growing its traditional customer base 
the partnership expects to achieve base business growth by improving customer service and the effectiveness of its sales force  while maintaining competitive prices 
in addition  the partnership will control operating and administrative expenses by executing a series of initiatives to enhance productivity 
analysis of results of operations the following analysis compares the partnership s results of operations for the year ended september  fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal and fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal 
the following table provides gallon  weather and certain financial information for the partnership and should be read in conjunction with fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal dollars in millions year ended september  gallons sold millions retail   wholesale revenues retail propane    wholesale propane other total margin a ebitda b operating income net income degree days warmer colder than normal c a total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales 
b ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and to evaluate our ability to meet loan covenants 
weather significantly impacts demand for propane and profitability because many customers use propane for heating purposes 
the following table includes reconciliations of net income to ebitda for the fiscal years presented year ended september  net income income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda c deviation from average heating degree days based upon national weather statistics provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for airports in the united states  excluding alaska 
fiscal compared with fiscal based upon heating degree day data  temperatures in fiscal were warmer than normal compared to temperatures that were essentially normal in fiscal retail propane volumes sold during fiscal decreased slightly compared to fiscal as the effects of warmer than normal winter weather more than offset volume growth from acquisitions  principally the october acquisition of horizon propane llc horizon propane 
in addition  fiscal retail propane volumes were also negatively affected by customer conservation driven by record high propane product costs 
low margin wholesale volumes increased primarily reflecting greater product cost hedging activities 
retail propane revenues increased million as a million increase due to higher average selling prices was partially offset by a million decrease due to the lower retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase due to higher average selling prices and a million increase due to the higher volumes sold relating to product cost hedging activities 
in fiscal  the propane industry experienced sustained higher propane product costs which resulted in higher average retail and wholesale selling prices 
total propane cost of sales increased million principally reflecting the effects of significantly higher propane product costs 
despite lower retail volumes sold as a result of the warmer weather  total margin increased million due to higher average retail propane margins per gallon and greater margin from non propane sales and services 
as a result of significantly higher propane product costs  the partnership increased average retail selling prices realizing higher average margins per gallon while remaining competitive in the marketplace 
average ppx margin per gallon decreased in fiscal as selling prices were lowered in response to competition in the marketplace 
the effects of lower average ppx selling prices on ppx margin per gallon were partially offset by effective cost management initiatives 
margin from non propane sales and services increased million principally reflecting higher margin from tank rentals  ppx cylinder sales and hauling and terminal sales and services 
ebitda increased million in fiscal reflecting the previously mentioned increase in total margin  the absence of a million loss on extinguishment of long term debt incurred in fiscal  and a million increase in other income 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses principally due to higher compensation  distribution  administrative and general insurance expenses  partially offset by the absence of million of expenses associated with initiating the management realignment in fiscal and the continued beneficial effects on fiscal operating expenses of the realignment 
although ebitda is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and to evaluate the partnership s ability to meet loan covenants 
other income in fiscal increased principally due to greater income from finance charges 
operating income in fiscal increased million as the previously mentioned increases in margin and other income were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense related to recent acquisitions  higher depreciation associated with ppx and the aforementioned increase in operating expenses 
net income in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal due to the increase in operating income  a million decrease in interest expense and the absence of the million loss on extinguishment of long term debt incurred in fiscal interest expense decreased principally as a result of lower long term debt outstanding 
fiscal compared with fiscal weather based upon heating degree days was essentially normal during fiscal compared to weather that was warmer than normal in fiscal although temperatures nationwide averaged near normal during fiscal  our overall results reflect weather that was significantly warmer in the west and generally colder than normal in the east 
retail propane volumes sold increased million gallons in fiscal due principally to the effects of the colder weather and  to a much lesser extent  volume growth from acquisitions and customer growth 
these increases were achieved notwithstanding the effects of price induced customer conservation and  with respect to commercial and industrial customers  continuing economic weakness 
retail propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase due to higher average selling prices and a million increase due to the higher retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase due to higher average selling prices and a million increase due to the higher volumes sold 
the higher retail and wholesale selling prices reflect significantly higher propane product costs during fiscal resulting from  among other things  higher crude oil and natural gas prices and lower propane inventories 
other revenues from ancillary sales and services were million in fiscal and million in fiscal total cost of sales increased million reflecting the higher propane product costs and higher volumes sold 
the million increase in total margin is principally due to the higher propane gallons sold and  to a lesser extent  slightly higher average retail propane unit margins 
notwithstanding the previously mentioned significant increase in the commodity price of propane  retail propane unit margins were slightly higher than the prior year reflecting the effects of the higher average selling prices and the benefits of favorable propane product cost hedging activities 
ebitda increased million in fiscal reflecting the previously mentioned increase in total margin and a million increase in other income partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses and a million increase in losses associated with early extinguishments of long term debt 
operating and administrative expenses increased principally due to higher medical and general insurance expenses  higher distribution expenses as a result of the previously mentioned greater retail volumes  and higher incentive compensation and uncollectible accounts expenses 
in addition  the partnership incurred million of costs during fiscal associated with a realignment of the partnership s management structure announced in june other income in fiscal includes a gain of million from the settlement of certain hedge contracts and greater income from finance charges and asset sales while other income in the prior year was reduced by a million loss from declines in the value of propane commodity option contracts 
operating income in fiscal increased less than the increase in ebitda due to higher depreciation expense principally associated with ppx partially offset by the previously mentioned increase in losses associated with early extinguishments of long term debt 
net income increased million reflecting the increase in operating income partially offset by the previously mentioned increase in losses associated with the early extinguishments of long term debt 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s debt outstanding at september  totaled million 
there were no amounts outstanding under amerigas olp s credit agreement at september  amerigas olp s credit agreement expires on october  and consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general purposes of amerigas olp 
the acquisition facility provides amerigas olp with the ability to borrow up to million to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets or  to the extent it is not so used  for working capital and general purposes  subject to restrictions in the amerigas partners senior notes indentures 
issued and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  which reduce the amount available for borrowings  totaled million at september  amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
amerigas olp also has a credit agreement with the general partner to borrow up to million on an unsecured  subordinated basis  for working capital and general purposes 
ugi has agreed to contribute up to million to the general partner to fund such borrowings 
amerigas partners periodically issues debt and equity securities and expects to continue to do so 
it has issued debt securities and common units in underwritten public offerings in each of the last three fiscal years 
most recently  it issued debt securities in april and common units in may  both in underwritten public offerings 
proceeds of public offerings are used to reduce indebtedness and for general partnership purposes  including funding acquisitions 
amerigas partners has effective debt and equity shelf registration statements with the us securities and exchange commission sec under which it may issue up to an additional million amerigas partners common units and up to million of debt or equity pursuant to an unallocated shelf registration statement 
amerigas olp must maintain certain financial ratios in order to borrow under its credit agreement including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
amerigas olp s ratios calculated as of september  permit it to borrow up to the maximum amount available 
for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 
based upon existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations  borrowings available under its credit agreement  and the expected refinancing of its maturing long term debt  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs in fiscal partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its available cash for such quarter 
available cash generally means all cash on hand at the end of such quarter  plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings after the end of such quarter  less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion 
since its formation in  the partnership has paid the minimum quarterly distribution of mqd on all limited partner units outstanding 
the amount of available cash needed annually to pay the mqd on all units and the general partner interests in fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
based upon the number of partnership units outstanding on september   the amount of available cash needed annually to pay the mqd on all units and the general partner interests is approximately million 
a reasonable proxy for the amount of cash available for distribution that is generated by the partnership can be calculated by subtracting from the partnership s ebitda interest expense and capital expenditures needed to maintain operating capacity 
partnership distributable cash as calculated under this method for fiscal  and is as follows year ended september  millions of dollars net income income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda interest expense maintenance capital expenditures distributable cash although distributable cash is a reasonable estimate of the amount of cash available for distribution by the partnership  it does not reflect  among other things  the impact of changes in working capital and the amount of distributable cash used to finance growth capital expenditures  which can significantly affect cash available for distribution 
distributable cash should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes distributable cash is a meaningful non gaap measure for evaluating the partnership s ability to declare and pay the mqd pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement 
the partnership s definition of distributable cash may be different from that used by other companies 
although the level of distributable cash in fiscal was less than the full mqd  other sources of cash  including cash from equity offerings and borrowings and changes in working capital  were more than sufficient to permit the partnership to pay the full mqd 
the ability of the partnership to pay the mqd on all units depends upon a number of factors 
these factors include the level of partnership earnings  the cash needs of the partnership s operations including cash needed for maintaining and increasing operating capacity  changes in operating working capital  and the partnership s ability to borrow under its credit agreement  to refinance maturing debt and to increase its long term debt 
some of these factors are affected by conditions beyond our control including weather  competition in markets we serve  the cost of propane and changes in capital market conditions 
conversion of subordinated units in december  the general partner determined that the cash based performance and distribution requirements for the conversion of the remaining  subordinated units  all of which were held by the general partner  had been met in respect of the quarter ended september  as a result  these subordinated units were converted to a like number of common units effective november  the conversion of the subordinated units did not result in an increase in the total number of amerigas partners limited partner units outstanding 
contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including obligations associated with long term debt  lease obligations and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  in millions payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt operating leases propane supply contracts total  cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership uses its revolving credit facility to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal changes in operating working capital used million and million of operating cash flow in fiscal and  and provided million in fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal and working capital cash needs primarily reflects the effects of higher propane product costs on customer accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
investing activities 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we spent million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal compared to expenditures of million comprising maintenance capital expenditures of million and growth capital expenditures of million in fiscal proceeds from disposals of assets increased million principally due to strategic divestitures of certain district locations 
during fiscal  the partnership acquired horizon propane and several other propane distribution businesses for total cash consideration of million 
financing activities 
cash flow used by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activity cash flow is primarily the result of repayments and issuances of long term debt  borrowings under our credit agreement  distributions on limited partner units and proceeds from issuances of common units 
in april  amerigas olp repaid million face amount of maturing first mortgage notes 
in conjunction with this repayment  amerigas partners issued million face amount of senior notes due at an effective rate of  and contributed the net proceeds of million to amerigas olp 
in may  amerigas partners sold  common units in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of per unit 
in june  the underwriters partially exercised their overallotment option in the amount of  common units 
the net proceeds of the public offering totaling million and the associated capital contributions from the general partner were contributed to amerigas olp and used to reduce indebtedness under its bank credit agreement and for general partnership purposes 
related party transactions pursuant to the partnership agreement and a management services agreement among amerigas eagle holdings  inc aeh  the general partner of amerigas eagle propane  lp eagle olp  and amerigas propane  inc the general partner  the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of the partnership 
these costs  which totaled million in  million in and million in  include employee compensation and benefit expenses of employees of the general partner and general and administrative expenses 
ugi corporation ugi provides certain financial and administrative services to the general partner 
ugi bills the general partner for all direct and indirect corporate expenses incurred in connection with providing these services and the general partner is reimbursed by the partnership for these expenses 
such corporate expenses totaled million in  million in and million in in addition  ugi and certain of its subsidiaries provide office space and automobile liability insurance to the partnership 
these expenses totaled million in  million in and million in subsequent to the columbia propane acquisition and prior to the sale of the partnership s ownership interest in atlantic energy see note to consolidated financial statements  the partnership purchased propane on behalf of atlantic energy  inc atlantic energy 
atlantic energy reimbursed amerigas olp for its purchases plus interest as atlantic energy sold such propane to third parties or to amerigas olp itself 
the total dollar value of propane purchased on behalf of atlantic energy was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
purchases of propane by amerigas olp from atlantic energy during  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in november  in conjunction with the partnership s sale of its ownership interest in atlantic energy  ugi asset management  inc ugi asset management and amerigas olp entered into a product sales agreement whereby ugi asset management has agreed to sell and amerigas olp has agreed to purchase a minimum of million gallons of propane annually at the atlantic energy terminal in chesapeake  virginia 
the product sales agreement will take effect on april  and continue for a primary term of five years with an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional five years 
the price to be paid for product purchased under the agreement will be determined annually using a contractual formula that takes into account published index prices and the locational value of deliveries at the atlantic energy terminal 
prior to the sale of atlantic energy  the general partner provided it with other services including accounting  insurance and other administrative services and was reimbursed for the related costs 
such costs were not material during  or in addition  amerigas olp entered into product cost hedging contracts on behalf of atlantic energy 
when these contracts were settled  amerigas olp was reimbursed the cost of any losses  or distributed the proceeds of any gains  to atlantic energy 
amounts due from atlantic energy at september  and totaled million and million  respectively  which amounts are included in accounts receivable related parties in the consolidated balance sheets 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have an effect on the partnership s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane are principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs  and the partnership generally attempts to pass on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
in order to minimize credit risk associated with derivative commodity contracts  we carefully monitor established credit limits with the contract counterparties 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact its fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under amerigas olp s credit agreement 
this agreement has interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
based upon weighted average borrowings outstanding under these agreements during fiscal and fiscal  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased our interest expense by million during each fiscal year 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with near term forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we enter into interest rate protection agreements 
the following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instruments held at september  and it also includes the changes in fair value that would result if there were an adverse change in the market price of propane of cents per gallon and interest rates on ten year us treasury notes of basis points change in fair fair value value millions of dollars september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk because the partnership s derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under sfas  we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane price or interest rate risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated underlying transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management 
the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in these policies could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with its audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
litigation accruals 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability  and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which was originally issued in january and clarifies accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin was effective immediately for variable interest entities created or obtained after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired before february   fin was effective beginning with our interim period ended march  if certain conditions are met  fin requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate certain variable interest entities 
the partnership has not created or obtained any variable interest entities prior to  or after january  therefore  the adoption of fin did not affect the partnership s financial position or results of operations 
effective april  the partnership adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
eitf  which results in the calculation of net income per limited partner unit for each period according to distributions declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings  as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed 
in periods with undistributed earnings above certain levels  the calculation according to the two class method results in an increased allocation of undistributed earnings to the general partner and a dilution of the earnings to the limited partners 
due to the seasonality of the propane business  the dilutive effect of eitf on net income per limited partner unit will typically impact the first three fiscal quarters 
eitf did not impact net income per limited partner unit for the fiscal year
