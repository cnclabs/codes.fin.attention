off balance sheet transactions the company was not a party to any off balance sheet transactions during any of the three years ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant policies are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  the impairment of excess of cost over fair value of net assets of acquired businesses and income taxes 
the company s information technology services segment includes revenue recognized under multiple element arrangements with its customers  which requires the use of significant judgments and estimates by management 
the accounting policies for revenue recognition in the information technology services segment comply with aicpa statement of position no 
software revenue recognition 
sop no 
requires revenue to be recognized only after software is delivered  all significant obligations of the company are fulfilled  and all significant uncertainties regarding customer acceptance have expired 
sop no 
also requires the unbundling of multiple elements and the allocation of pricing to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
in addition  the information technology services segment s revenues under long term service contracts are accounted for using a proportional performance method or on a straight line basis in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates the amortization for goodwill excess of cost over fair value of net assets of acquired businesses and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
under sfas no 
 intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as of december   the company had no intangible assets subject to amortization under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
sfas no 
requires a two step process for testing impairment 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
if an impairment is indicated  then second  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value 
based on valuations and analysis performed by independent valuation consultants and the company in the first quarter of  the company determined that the carrying value of its goodwill exceeded implied fair value  and therefore  the company recorded a non cash charge  after income taxes  of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
no impairment charge was appropriate under the previous goodwill impairment standard sfas no 
 which was based on undiscounted cash flows 
based on valuations and analysis performed by the company at december   no additional impairment charge was required 
future evaluations of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets are dependent on many factors  several of which are out of the company s control  including the demand for services provided 
to the extent that such factors or conditions change  it is possible that future impairments could occur  which could have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
at december   the company had a significant amount of net deferred tax assets  which consisted principally of net operating loss carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences resulting from differences in the tax and book basis of certain assets and liabilities 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire  if unused  as follows million in  million in  million in  and million in the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date 
based on evaluations performed by the company pursuant to sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of  a non cash valuation allowance of million was provided with respect to the company s federal and state net deferred tax assets see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to limitation in the event of a change in ownership  as defined in the tax laws 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  primarily to clarify the required accounting for interests in variable interest entities vies 
this standard replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  that was issued in january to address certain situations in which a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
for the company  application of fin r is required for interests in certain vies that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities  or spes  as of december  and for interests in all other types of vies as of march  the application of fin r has not and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in december of  sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  was issued 
sfas no 
revised prescribes employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  but does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
sfas no 
revised retains and revises the disclosure requirements contained in the original sfas no 
and requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
sfas no revised  which applies to a defined benefits pension plan of a foreign subsidiary of the company  must be adopted by the company in the fiscal year ending december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on the company s debt and investment portfolios and fluctuations in foreign currency 
the company centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents  accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate fair value 
the company s investments are not material to the financial position or performance of the company 
assuming variable rate debt of million at december   a one percent increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
a significant portion of the technical services business is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
