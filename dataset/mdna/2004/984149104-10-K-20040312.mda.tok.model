introduced in  the mobile assistant ma series is the company s primary line of wearable computer hardware products  the current versions of which are the ma v and ma tc 
introduced in  the atigo product line is a family of mobile wireless web panels that can be used either as stand alone handheld personal computers pcs or as displays for an ma system  a laptop or a conventional pc 
since their commercial introductions  the company has recognized revenue of approximately  on sales of approximately  ma and atigo systems 
the company derives its revenues from sales of its wearable computers  software products and consulting services 
in the future  the company expects to obtain additional revenues from the licensing of its intellectual property 
a number of trends are expected to have a significant effect on the company s operations in the future 
in past quarters  many of the company s large customers deferred or delayed anticipated purchases of the company s products because of uncertain economic conditions and other concerns 
if these conditions and issues persist or worsen  it is possible that more potential customers will defer  delay or cancel scheduled purchases  which would have an adverse effect on company operations 
while the company believes that general economic conditions began to improve during late and expects that they will continue to improve during  there can be no assurance that this expectation will be realized 
additionally  to the extent that potential customers have concerns about purchases from smaller suppliers  such concerns could have a negative impact on the company s revenues 
beginning with the widespread use of the internet on desktop computers  there has been an increasing demand for mobile computing and wireless communications devices that can bring the desktop internet experience to mobile users 
the rapid growth of internet enabled cell phones  pdas  interactive pagers and similar products result in a growing number of devices that cater to the mobile data user and which may compete with the company s products and which may also present opportunities for licensing in the future 
the company believes that sales of its wearable and mobile computers will rely to a large extent on the availability of wireless broadband services that can take advantage of the extensive processing power and display capabilities of the company s hardware products 
wireless lans are now well established in commercial markets worldwide that provide broadband capabilities over a limited physical range in places such as corporate offices  warehouses  factory floors and airfields 
however  wide range wireless access that allows a user to move freely over large geographic areas and still maintain broadband access commonly referred to as third generation or g is still only available in limited areas  including japan and parts of europe 
the company predicts that g service will be available in large metropolitan areas worldwide in the next few years 
for example  ntt docomo and at t wireless have announced plans to launch g service in select us cities by december the company believes that while the commercial markets can still be successfully penetrated prior to the widespread introduction of wireless broadband access  such service will be needed prior to successful large scale sales in the consumer markets 
critical accounting policies in accounting for the financial results of the company s operations  management employs several critical accounting methods and policies and makes estimates and assumptions which materially affect the manner in which such results are presented 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows inventory and tooling 
inventory consists primarily of wearable computer component parts held for resale and allocated tooling costs  and is primarily comprised of finished goods 
the capitalized tooling asset consists of payments made to third party vendors for their products and services that are used in the manufacture of the company s proprietary hardware products 
periodically  the company records charges and reserves against its inventory and tooling asset balances 
to determine the size of the charges and reserves to record  if any  management performs a review of the carrying value of its inventory and tooling 
as a result of this review  it may be determined that certain of the company s inventory is slow moving  risks becoming obsolete or may likely be sold at below historical cost 
based upon a specific review of the carrying costs for the inventory items  management estimates the quantity of each inventory item that the company expects to be able to sell and  if appropriate  quantifies inventory amounts that may not be recoverable 
subsequent to recording such charges and reserves  if any  management does not expect to record significant profits or losses upon the ultimate sale of this inventory 
this review is based on a number of assumptions and estimates made by management  including but not limited to those related to the introduction of new and competing product lines  the company s ability to sell the quantities of inventory on hand as well as the quantities expected to be received in the future  the net sales price the company ultimately expects to achieve  the introduction of competing products  customer demand and general economic conditions 
this analysis takes into account estimated price concessions which management believes are likely to be necessary in disposing of this inventory 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
the capitalized tooling asset is systematically allocated to inventory and property and equipment and is amortized as a component of cost of sales or depreciation based upon the number of units sold or used as demonstration units in a given period compared to the total number of units management expects to make in a product s production run 
management s expectation of the number of units to be made during a given product s production run is based on a number of assumptions and estimates  including but not limited to those related to the introduction of new product lines  the company s ability to procure and sell the quantities of inventory  the introduction of competing products  customer demand and general economic conditions 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
patents 
the company capitalizes legal fees  filing fees and other direct costs incurred to obtain patents and trademarks 
these costs are amortized over a five year period which management believes approximates the economic life of such patents even though the legal life of the patents is usually longer 
the costs of maintaining patents are expensed as incurred 
whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that there is the potential for the impairment of the carrying values of these patent assets  management performs an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
as a result of such analysis  management may reserve against or write down the carrying value of the patent asset 
the company recorded a  charge during against the carrying value of certain of its non strategic patents 
this charge was based on a number of assumptions and estimates made by management  including but not limited to those related to the outcome of potential litigation against competitors who may infringe on the company s patents  the outcome of potential litigation brought against the company related to infringement of another company s patents  impairment of trade secrets and know how and the company s intentions to use a given patent in the future 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
warranties for hardware product sales 
for sales of its hardware products within the us  the company generally provides a standard one year warranty on its parts and a six month warranty on labor 
the company s suppliers for the significant components of the company s hardware products  including the computing unit  fpd  hmd and batteries  provide the company with similar warranties 
the company s distribution partners are generally responsible for user and software support for channel sales 
in certain instances  the company offers extended warranties for up to two years beyond the standard one year warranty on atigo and the ma v 
the supplier of atigo typically provides the company with a corresponding warranty 
in certain instances  the company provides warranties in excess of those provided by its vendors to meet the specific needs of its customers 
at the time of sale  the company estimates and accrues the cost of such warranties 
if such warranty costs are ultimately higher than anticipated  the company may incur warranty expenses in the future that are significantly greater than those incurred in the past 
warranty expense is recorded by management using a number of assumptions and estimates  including but not limited to those related to estimates for future warranty claims based on reviews of historical warranty experience as well as other general and customer specific factors  industry warranty trends  intended uses by customers  successful negotiation of extended warranty coverage from the company s vendors and continued warranty support from vendors 
additionally  because of the recent introduction and unique nature of the ma v  ma tc and atigo product lines  the company only has limited historical data on which to forecast future warranty claims 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional warranty expenses may be recorded by the company 
revenue recognition on fixed price contracts 
the company recognizes revenue from long term service contracts in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts  using the relevant guidance in statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  as determined by the terms and conditions of the company s various consulting contracts with its customers  which typically involve software engineering and related services 
revenue is recognized on fixed price contracts based on the percentage of completion method by calculating the ratio of costs incurred over total estimated costs to complete  a basis which management believes reasonably matches revenue to proportional performance under each related contract 
historically  the company has not recorded losses related to its fixed price contracts 
however  in the event that the costs to complete increase  or are anticipated to increase  to a level that will result in a negative gross margin to the company  a loss will be recognized in the period that this determination is made 
possible events that could cause the total estimated costs to complete a project to change include  but are not limited to  the occurrence of unanticipated complications  technical or otherwise  changes to a client s requirements  general inefficiencies in the management of the engagement  a change in key personnel or the cost of personnel 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and december  revenue cost of sales provision for inventory and tooling gross loss income operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses interest and other net loss years ended december  and december  revenue 
the company derives its revenue from product sales of mobile wearable computers and components  product sales of software  and consulting services 
total revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  product revenue remained consistent between the year ended december  and at  and  respectively  representing a increase 
hardware revenues from us operations increased to  in compared to  driven primarily by atigo and alternative solutions sales 
alternative solutions consist of sales of non proprietary mobile wearable hardware based on a customer s specific needs and requirements 
alternative solutions sales totaled  during  compared with in this increase in us hardware revenues was offset by a decrease to  in compared to of european hardware sales of ma tc and ma v systems 
this decrease in european revenues was due to a drop in orders from a large european customer 
hardware revenues from asia  consisting primarily of ma v systems  decreased by to  in compared to there was no software product revenue in or revenue from software products generally consists of a few large transactions that are unrelated to the company s hardware products 
consulting  licensing and other revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for this increase was driven by revenues earned on two new large contracts in the us cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales include the costs of components for mobile wearable computer systems  purchased software  direct labor and materials  amortization of tooling costs  warranty costs  fulfillment and shipping costs  and inventory and tooling reserves 
total cost of sales for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the cost of sales related to the company s hardware products decreased to  for the year ended december  this decrease in hardware product cost of sales occurred during a period in which hardware product sales increased 
this fluctuation was caused by several factors 
first  total warranty costs for the year ended december  included  in charges for product replacement related to ma v sales to two of the company s us customers 
the company believes that the warranty expenses specific to these customers were non recurring in nature and does not anticipate that it will continue to record similar warranty expenses related to the ma v or other current product lines 
in addition  margins on sales of the ma v and tc were lower in since these products had been introduced in and margins typically drop following a product s commercial launch 
partially offsetting the above factors  which negatively affected hardware margins  was the commercial launch of the atigo product line in the third quarter of  which resulted in higher margins in the second half of during  the company continued to introduce new products in the atigo family  namely the atigo m and atigo t  and was therefore able to maintain relatively high hardware margins following their launches 
also affecting margins was the alternative solutions sale consisting of non proprietary wearable mobile hardware during for which no similar sales occurred during the company recorded gross margins on this alternative solutions sale of during the company expects margins on alternative solution sales to vary depending on the wearable mobile product deployed 
as a result of the above activities  gross margins from hardware sales for the year ended december  were  compared to for cost of sales of consulting  licensing and other revenue increased  which is consistent with the increase in consulting  license and other revenue 
as a result  consulting  licensing and other revenue gross margin was for both and total gross margins  excluding the provision for inventory and tooling  were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the company recognized inventory and tooling provisions of  and  in the fiscal years and  respectively  related to its wearable computer product lines 
the inventory and tooling provision included charges of i  against ma v inventory  components and tooling  ii  against ma tc inventory  iii  against ma iv inventory and iv  against poma inventory 
the inventory and tooling provision consisted of i a  charge to write down the net carrying value of inventory associated with the ma v  ma tc and ma iv product lines due to an estimated general decline in their value  ii a  charge related to a write down of a small number of early production models of the ma v product line with limited hard disk capacity received by the company  iii the  reversal of an inventory reserve recorded in related to the poma product line  a prior model of wearable computer and iv a  reserve against tooling associated with the ma v product line 
total gross margins  including the provisions for inventory and tooling  were and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the company s management believes that it can sell its wearable mobile computer inventory at amounts that approximate current net carrying values  which have been reduced as a result of the above charges 
to determine the size of the charges to record  management reviewed the carrying value of its inventory in light of the introduction of new and competing product lines  its ability to sell the quantities of inventory on hand as well as the quantities expected to be received in the future and the sales prices it ultimately expects to achieve 
this analysis took into account estimated price concessions which management believes are likely to be necessary in disposing of this inventory 
the significant majority of the inventory and tooling charges during and were recorded against the ma v product line 
even after the successful renegotiation of certain of the ma v manufacturing contracts during  the company had commitments to purchase significant quantities of inventory 
the company was required to write down and reserve a substantial portion of the ma v inventory in and as historical and forecasted sales are not sufficient to sell such quantities of inventory 
as a result of this review  it was determined that certain of the company s inventory is slow moving  risked becoming obsolete or will likely be sold at below its historical cost 
based upon a specific review of the carrying costs for the inventory items  management estimated the quantity of each inventory item that the company was expected to be able to sell and also quantified inventory amounts that may not be recoverable 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
management does not expect to record significant profits or losses upon the ultimate sale of this inventory 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the same period in this decrease is due to sustained cost savings measures that began in which resulted in decreases of approximately    and  respectively  in salaries and benefits  consulting  promotional items and trade shows 
non cash expense for outside marketing services funded through the issuance of the company s equity securities decreased by  to  in compared to  in general expenditures for sales and marketing expenses of the european and asian operations also decreased  from to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the corresponding period in as a result of the sustained cost savings measures that began in  general and administrative expenses in relating to salaries and benefits and consulting decreased approximately  and  respectively  compared to the same period in research and development expenses 
the company s research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  the purchase of test equipment and payments to consultants and other third parties which provide research and development services for general wearable technology 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the corresponding period in as a result of sustained cost saving measures that began in  research and development expenses in related to salaries  benefits and consulting decreased approximately   and  respectively 
an additional decrease resulted from a  decline in expenditures to third parties and consultants for design and development of the company s mobile wearable product lines 
expenditures during both the and periods related primarily to the atigo product line 
in addition  the research and development expenses of the company s european operations decreased by  from to due to sustained cost saving measures that began in interest and other expenses income  net 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  compared to interest income of  this decrease resulted primarily from the write off of a discount on a note payable in from early repayment of  provision for income taxes 
the company accrued and for a tax provision for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the operations of its foreign subsidiaries 
the company s us operations had a net loss for the years ended december  and and  therefore  no provision for us income taxes was required 
net loss 
as a result of the factors described above  the net loss for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the corresponding period in years ended december  and december  revenue 
the company derives its revenue from product sales of its mobile wearable computers and components  product sales of software and consulting services 
total revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  product revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the increase in product revenue was attributable to sales of the company s mobile wearable computer systems  which increased from  in to  in the increase in hardware sales resulted primarily from sales of two new product lines introduced in  the poma and atigo 
additional hardware product revenue resulted from the company s emphasis on new and enhanced product lines  the ma v and ma tc  which were introduced late in hardware revenues from us operations increased to  in compared to  driven primarily by atigo and ma v sales 
this increase was offset by a decrease to  in european hardware sales in compared to  due primarily to a decrease in orders from a large european customer 
hardware revenues from asia  consisting primarily of ma v systems  decreased by to  in compared to offsetting this overall increase in wearable computer sales was a decrease in software product revenue from  in to in revenue from software products generally consists of a few large transactions that occur throughout the year that are unrelated to the company s hardware products 
therefore  it is not uncommon to have significant fluctuations in software revenue from year to year 
the company s consulting  licensing and other revenue remained consistent between the year ended december  and at  and  respectively  representing a decrease  as the number of ongoing consulting contracts remained relatively consistent between and cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales include the costs of components for the company s wearable computer product lines  purchased software  direct labor and materials  amortization of tooling costs  warranty costs  fulfillment and shipping costs  and inventory and tooling reserves 
total cost of sales remained consistent between the year ended december  and at  and  respectively  representing less than a one percent decrease 
the cost of sales related to the company s hardware products increased to  for the year ended december  this increase in hardware product cost of sales is significantly greater than the increase in hardware product sales 
this fluctuation was caused by several factors 
first  total warranty costs for the year ended december  increased  compared to the same period in due to certain charges for product replacement related to sales of the ma v to two of the company s us customers 
the company believes that the warranty expenses specific to these customers were non recurring in nature and does not anticipate that it will continue to record similar warranty expenses in the future 
in addition  margins on sales of the ma v and tc were higher in the period than in the period  since both the ma v and ma tc product lines were introduced in and margins are typically highest following a product s commercial launch 
partially offsetting the above factors which negatively affected hardware margins  the company began shipping the atigo product line in the third quarter of  which resulted in a positive effect on margins 
as a result of these activities  gross margins from hardware sales for the year ended december  were  compared to for software cost of sales decreased from  for the year ended december  to for the same period in as the company had no software sales in the lack of high margin software sales impacts negatively on the company s gross margin from product sales which decreased to for the fiscal year from for cost of sales of consulting  licensing and other revenue decreased  which is relatively consistent with the decrease in consulting  license and other revenue 
this resulted in an increase in related margins to in from in  due primarily to an increase in the mix of higher margin contracts in when compared to the company recognized inventory and tooling provisions of  and  in the fiscal years and  respectively  related to its wearable computer product lines which are discussed in detail below 
total gross margins  including the provisions for inventory and tooling  were and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the inventory and tooling provision consisted of i a  charge to write down the net carrying value of inventory associated with the ma v  ma tc and ma iv product lines due to an estimated general decline in their value  ii a  charge related to a write down of a small number of early production models of the ma v product line with limited hard disk capacity received by the company  iii the  reversal of an inventory reserve recorded in related to the poma product line  a prior model of wearable computer  discussed below and iv a  reserve against tooling associated with the ma v product line 
the inventory and tooling provision consisted of i a  charge to reduce the net carrying value of inventory associated with the ma iv product line given the uncertainties created by the introduction of the ma v and ma tc product lines  ii a  inventory write off established for hard disk drives that were purchased for the ma v product line but later replaced with higher capacity hard disk drives during the first quarter of  all of the hard drives were sold in bulk at an amount approximating their net carrying value and this reserve was fully utilized  iii the  inventory charge recorded in related to the poma product line discussed below and iv a  charge to reduce the net carrying value of tooling associated with the ma iv product line 
in  a charge of  was recorded to reflect management s estimate of losses to be incurred on the total initial production run of the poma product line 
the company elected to sell the poma systems at prices that are less than their initial production costs to favorably position poma in the price sensitive light commercial and near consumer markets 
although the poma inventory had not been received by the company as of december   the company recorded the expected losses during  which was the period in which the underlying contracts were entered into 
because the inventory had not been received by the company as of december   and was therefore not recorded as an asset  this charge was recorded as an accrued liability which was being reclassified to an inventory reserve as poma inventory shipments were received during during  the company entered into an agreement with the manufacturer of poma through which the company was relieved of its obligation to purchase additional poma units 
pursuant to the terms of this agreement  the company made a payment of  during and reduced certain of the royalty rates that are used to calculate the licensing fees that the company receives from the manufacturer for its sales of poma or other wearable computer products 
during  the remaining accrued liability balance  net of the  payment  was reversed  resulting in a  reduction to the provision for inventory and tooling reserve 
the company s management believes that it can sell its wearable mobile computer inventory at amounts that approximate current net carrying values  which have been reduced as a result of the above charges 
to determine the size of the charges to record  management reviewed the carrying value of its inventory in light of the introduction of new and competing product lines  its ability to sell the quantities of inventory on hand as well as the quantities expected to be received in the future and the sales prices it ultimately expects to achieve 
this analysis took into account estimated price concessions which management believes are likely to be necessary in disposing of this inventory 
as a result of this review  it was determined that certain of the company s inventory is slow moving  risked becoming obsolete or will likely be sold at below its historical cost 
based upon a specific review of the carrying costs for the inventory items  management estimated the quantity of each inventory item that the company was expected to be able to sell and also quantified inventory amounts that may not be recoverable 
management does not expect to record significant profits or losses upon the ultimate sale of this inventory 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the same period in included in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  is a  non cash charge related to the cancellation of an agreement for marketing services and certain retail space at the waldorf astoria hotel in new york city 
non cash expenses for outside marketing services funded through the issuance of the company s equity securities  which included expenses of the marketing and rental agreement at the waldorf astoria hotel before cancellation  were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  decreases of approximately     and  respectively  in recruiting costs  salaries  benefits  consulting and promotional items occurred as a result of the cost saving measures undertaken in the last three quarters of general expenditures for sales and marketing expenses of the european and asian operations also decreased  from to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the corresponding period in as a result of the cost saving measures undertaken in the last three quarters of  general and administrative expenses relating to salaries and benefits  consulting and travel decreased approximately   and  respectively  compared to the same period in research and development expenses 
the company s research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  the purchase of test equipment and payments to consultants and other third parties which provide research and development services for general wearable technology 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the corresponding period in this decrease resulted largely from a  decline in expenditures to third parties and consultants for design and development of the company s mobile wearable product lines 
expenditures during the period related to the ma v and ma tc product lines while expenditures during the period related primarily to the atigo product line 
in addition  the research and development expenses of the company s european and asian operations decreased by  from to due to cost saving measures undertaken in the last three quarters of restructuring costs 
restructuring costs were  for year ended december  these expenses relate to the company s cost cutting efforts undertaken in the second  third and fourth quarters of  for which no comparable expenses were recorded during the same periods in these expenses consist of  for severance extended to terminated employees  a  charge related to the reduction of facilities  a  write off of certain capitalized patent costs and  for the closing of the company s branch operations in japan 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary operating in japan  xybernaut kk  was not closed 
interest and other  net 
other income for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the corresponding period in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest income earned from the company s cash balances from the fiscal year compared to the same period of provision for income taxes

included in the accounts receivable at december  is  associated with two december sales for which the company collected the balance in in addition  accounts receivable at december  include  of unbilled accounts receivable representing amounts earned and recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company expects to bill this amount in its entirety in upon reaching certain milestones in the contract 
at december   the company had prepaid assets of  an increase of  or  from the december  balance of  this fluctuation is due to an increase in payments of  to a vendor of atigo products prior to the receipt of inventory 
these shipments are expected to be received in this increase is offset by a decrease of  of prepaid assets in the company s european subsidiary due to cost saving measures 
the deferred revenue balances at december  and result from billings to customers that were in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts and from warranty revenue on hardware products 
deferred revenue on service contracts will be recognized as revenue as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
at december  and   and  respectively  were recorded as deferred revenue from service contracts

at december  and   and  respectively  were recorded as deferred revenue from warranties  of which   and  were classified as long term liabilities at december  and  respectively 
the company has recorded net losses since its inception 
these losses are primarily attributable to the operating expenses incurred by the company to design  develop  market and sell its mobile and wearable computer products and to provide general and administrative support for these operating activities 
the company s revenues and gross margins have not been sufficient to fund these operating activities 
as a result  the company has consistently reported negative cash flows from operating activities and net losses and had an accumulated deficit of  at december  the combination of the company s operating losses and its working capital requirements has severely impacted the company s financial position and liquidity 
during  and  the company funded its operating and investing activities through its financing activities  which consist primarily of private placements of common stock  warrant and stock option exercises and borrowings 
the company s management has taken steps that it believes are necessary to improve operations and raise additional capital  both of which are needed to meet its cash flow needs through december  and thereafter 
during and  management performed reviews of the company s operations and implemented various cost cutting programs to reduce the company s operating expenses to better align costs with current and expected business volume 
the company incurred total operating expenses in of approximately million  a decrease from million and million in and  respectively 
assuming there are no significant changes to the company s business plan  management expects to maintain a quarterly operating expense level of between million and million  representing savings of over from fourth quarter levels 
future significant fluctuations may still occur as a result of the company s research and development activities  which will vary depending on the company s wearable and mobile computer product development cycle during any given period 
additionally  new operations in china are expected to increase the company s operating expenses 
management believes that the company s current staffing and resources will be sufficient to carry out its business plan for the foreseeable future 
at the forecasted levels discussed above  management expects that the company will incur operating expenses of between million and million during however  there can be no assurances that actual operating expenses during or later periods will not be significantly higher 
the company will also be required to fund inventory procurement and other expenditures 
management expects to fund these activities through cash on hand  gross profits and outside financings 
potential sources of additional financing include private equity offerings  warrant exercises  strategic investments and various forms of debt financing 
in certain instances  concurrently with the exercise of warrants  the exercise prices have been reduced 
such reduction has resulted in the issuance of substantially more shares of common stock than would have occurred had the exercise price of the warrants not been reduced 
the company may reduce the exercise price of additional warrants in the future 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of current stockholders of the company will be reduced and if additional funds are raised at current and historical prices for the company s stock  such dilution could be significant 
if additional funds are raised through borrowings  the company will be subject to interest charges and principal repayments  will likely be required to comply with financial covenants or other restrictions  and will likely have to collateralize such borrowings with its assets  which could be taken by the lender in the event of default 
during  the company raised approximately million through sales of its common stock to institutional investors  through warrant and stock option exercises and through borrowings 
if a sustained decline in the general equity markets  the price of the company s common stock  or the us or world economy were to occur  the company could face difficulties in its ability to raise additional capital 
additionally  the company has historically made several private placements of its common stock per year  primarily to a limited number of institutional investors who specialize in making similar types of investments 
if these institutional investors were to choose to not participate in future private placements  the company could face difficulties in its ability to raise additional capital 
the company s certificate of incorporation limits its ability to issue more than  shares of common stock 
the company will be required to obtain shareholder approval to increase this number 
there can be no assurance that such approval will be obtained 
a limitation on the number of authorized shares may hinder the company s ability to obtain additional equity financing 
certain of the company s liabilities are past their stated terms of payment  including those owed to vendors that provide services and inventory which are required by the company to execute its business plan 
the company generally believes that it has a reasonably good relationship with most of its vendors and creditors 
however  certain of its vendors have filed legal actions to recover overdue accounts payables and ceased providing services and products to the company 
management does not believe that these actions will have a material adverse effect on the company  but there can be no assurance that other vendors will not pursue similar actions 
the company s management believes that the combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and outside additional funding from third party investors will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s ongoing cash requirements 
this is based on the company s historical ability to raise funds in the form of debt and equity financings 
however  there can be no assurance that the company can or will obtain sufficient funds from operations or from additional financings on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient additional financing  it will be required to reduce spending further in order to maintain its operations at a reduced level 
management believes that it would be able to reduce spending if required  however  there can be no assurances that it can successfully do so

all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  as a result of the company s international manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing  inventory procurement  and other activities  the company enters into transactions denominated in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen and the european euro or in which the us dollar equivalent is determined by the values of such currencies 
historically  the company has not realized significant gains or losses in transactions denominated in  or determined by  foreign currencies 
to date  the company has not entered into foreign exchange forward or option contracts to hedge its exposure to future movements in foreign exchange rates because the company s management believes that the potential impact of these movements does not justify the costs of entering into such contracts or the use of capital to collateralize these contracts 
as international sales and operations increase in the future  the company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge transactions denominated in a foreign currency or may be subjected to increased foreign currency exchange risk

if additional funds are raised through borrowings  the company will be subject to additional interest charges and will most likely be required to comply with financial covenants or other restrictions 
interest rate increases may materially increase the company s interest expense  hinder the company s ability to borrow additional funds or have a negative effect on the ability of the company s customers to purchase its products 
required financial covenants may also hinder the company s ability to expand or change its business operations 
to date  the company has not entered into interest rate forward or option contracts to hedge its exposure to future movements in interest rates because the company s management believes that the potential impact of these movements does not justify the costs of entering into such contracts or the use of capital to collateralize these contracts
