business logic is a critical part of today s new generation of enterprise applications  which are increasingly built in the java  enterprise edition jee programming language 
from our incorporation in august through december  we were a professional services company and generated revenue from technical consulting projects 
in january  we commenced development efforts on our initial software products  which we generated revenue from in late through early in september  we began development of our first web based software product  which we began shipping commercially in september in september  we introduced the first generation of what is now our suite of software products 
to date  we have licensed our products and provided services to over customers around the world 
in november  versata streamlined its operations to improve cash flow and increase the company s overall performance 
a key component of the initiative included a services agreement with virtusa corporation  a us based premier software engineering services firm  which also has advanced technology centers in india and sri lanka 
for the next two years  versata has retained virtusa to provide versata with engineering services including platform port development  quality assurance  and maintenance 
versata will retain responsibility for product vision  strategy  architecture  design and reference implementation  enabling it to more aggressively drive product innovation and rapidly deliver the next round of capabilities in support of its new strategy 
on december   versata announced a change in its fiscal year end from december to october the change was effective for the ten month period ended october  we derive our revenue from the sale of software product licenses and from related services 
our software is generally priced on a per central processing unit cpu basis 
sales of software licenses typically include revenue associated with product maintenance which provides the customer with unspecified software upgrades over a specified term  typically one year 
maintenance and support revenue consists of fees relating to the provision of customer support as well as product updates and upgrades 
professional services revenue includes consulting  training  mentoring  staff augmentation and project management or rapid requirements development to complete turnkey solution services 
customers typically purchase professional services from us for specialized training and mentoring activities directed at optimizing the customer s use of our software product 
professional services are generally sold on a time and materials basis 
maintenance and customer support is priced based on the particular level of support chosen by the customer and the number of cpu s in operation 
we market our products and services through our direct sales force  international distributors  consulting and system integration partners  companies that sell pre packaged software applications and companies that custom develop and integrate software applications 
our revenues to date have been derived predominantly from customers in north america 
net revenues from international sales represented   and  of our total revenue for the years ended october   and  and the ten months ended october  our cost of software license revenue consists of royalty payments to third parties for technology incorporated into our products  the cost of manuals and product documentation  as well as electronic delivery costs 
our cost of maintenance and support revenue consists of salaries  other employee related costs and general office costs incurred in providing customer maintenance and support

table of contents 
index to financial statements services revenue is likely to vary significantly from period to period depending on overall utilization rates  the mix of services we provide and whether these services are provided by us or by third party contractors 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our product development  sales and marketing and professional services departments  and to establish our administrative infrastructure 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed in the period incurred as such costs have not met the criteria for capitalization under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
historically  our operating expenses have exceeded the revenue generated by our products and services 
as a result  we have incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of october  and million as of october  for the year ended october  certain adjustments  not materially affecting the net loss  working capital or earnings per share calculations  were made to the consolidated financial statements after the press release was issued and before the conclusion of our financial statement audit 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we derive revenue from three sources as follows i sale of software licenses to end users  value added resellers var s  distributors  system integrators and independent software vendors isv s  ii maintenance and support which consist of post contract customer support pcs  and iii professional services which include consulting and training 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
under sop  we record revenue from licensing of software products to end users and system integrators  who use our software to build systems for their customers  when both parties sign a license agreement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of the product has occurred 
for var s and distributors  we recognize revenue upon notification of sell through  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for sales to certain isv s  where we receive non refundable royalty payments  we defer the fair value of pcs related to the arrangement and recognize the remainder as license revenue  when paid  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
generally  we provide payment terms that range from thirty to ninety days from the invoice date 
accordingly  payment terms that exceed ninety days are not considered fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized as payments become due 
when contracts contain multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements based upon the residual method 
vsoe is generally the price for products sold separately or the renewal rate in the agreement for pcs 
undelivered elements consist primarily of pcs and other services such as consulting  mentoring and training 
services are generally not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize revenue allocated to pcs ratably over the period of the contracts  which is generally twelve months 
for revenue related to consulting services  we recognize revenue as the related services are performed 
in instances where services are deemed essential to the software  both the software license fee and consulting fees are recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
the portion of fees related to either products delivered or services

index to financial statements rendered which are not due under our company s standard payment terms are reflected in deferred revenue and in unbilled receivables 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation we have several foreign subsidiaries  which together account for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended october   and of our assets and of our total liabilities as of october  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our stockholders equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in cumulative translation adjustments 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized in our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro  the indian rupee  and australian and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these periods 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected

an alternative method to the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation is the fair value approach prescribed by sfas  as amended by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
if the company followed the fair value approach  the company would be required to record deferred compensation based on the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant 
the fair value of the stock option is required to be computed using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes option valuation model  at the date of the stock option grant 
the deferred compensation calculated under the fair value method would then be amortized over the respective vesting period of the stock option 
information concerning the impact on our operating results of using the alternative of sfas is included below in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the event the company must adopt the provisions of fas  stock based compensation charges will increase our operating expense

requires that the company record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of the company s financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal matters requires significant judgment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its investments and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we establish policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
interest rate risks 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term time deposits of the local operating bank 
all of the cash equivalents  short term and long term investments are treated as available for sale 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  the company reduces its interest rate risk by investing its cash in instruments with short maturities 
we estimate that uniform change in general interest rates would have changed our net loss by approximately  in   in  and  for the ten months ending october

these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would have changed our net loss by approximately  in and  in the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall financial results
