item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview national health realty  inc nhr or the company is a real estate investment trust reit that began operations on january  currently nhr  through its subsidiary nhr op  lp the operating partnership  owns the real estate of health care facilities  including licensed skilled nursing facilities  six assisted living facilities and one independent living center the health care facilities  and owns first promissory notes with principal balances totaling  the notes at december  and secured by the real property of health care facilities 
competitive restrictions we have an advisory services agreement with national healthcare corporation nhc pursuant to which nhc will provide us with investment advice  office space and personnel 
nhc owns or manages long term care health care facilities with  beds in states 
nhc is the primary tenant of ten licensed skilled nursing facilities  six assisted living facilities and one independent living center owned by nhr 
the advisory services agreement provides that prior to the earlier to occur of i the termination of the advisory agreement for any reason or ii nhc ceasing to be actively engaged as the investment advisor for national health investors  inc nhi  we will not without the prior approval of nhi transact real estate leasing or financing business with any party  person  company or firm other than nhc 
it is the intent of the foregoing restriction that we will not be actively or passively engaged in the pursuit of additional investment opportunities  but rather we will focus upon our capacities as landlord and note holder of those certain assets conveyed to us by nhc s predecessor 
areas of focus in november  we received a prepayment of approximately million on our notes receivable from fcc 
we used the proceeds to reduce our bank credit facility which bore interest at at december  our cash flow was reduced by the approximate spread in these interest rates 
this reduction in cash flow will be offset in part by our december  purchase of approximately million of notes receivable which earn an average rate of 
we borrowed funds at approximately to purchase the million of notes receivable 
furthermore  the majority of our million of notes receivable from fcc mature on october  and may be prepaid without penalty before that date 
if and when these notes receivable are paid  the proceeds will be applied to our million line of credit which currently matures on december  and to the million note payable mentioned in the previous paragraph 
our cash flows would again be reduced by the spread between the yield on the mortgages receivable and the cost of debt 
however  no dividend reductions are expected in the near future 
accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  we may in the future determine that  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  revenue for interest or rent is not realizable 
for any such nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income only in the period when payments are received 
if conclusions as to the realizibility of revenue change  our revenues could vary significantly from period to period 
valuations of and impairments to our investments since the passage of the balanced budget act of affecting snfs january  the long term care industry has experienced material reductions in government and private insurance reimbursement 
some legislative relief was granted in and as a result of the balanced budget refinement act of  but some of those add on provisions expired october  materially reducing reimbursement 
effective october   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms increased reimbursement for medicare part a by in addition to the annual inflationary increase of 
no material changes to reimbursement are expected until cms refines the current rug iii case mix methodology 
the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments about refinancing which have affected some of our lessees and mortgagees 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgements and estimates on the part of management 
we monitor the liquidity and credit worthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an on going basis 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties and notes receivable are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to its stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
capital resources and liquidity at year end  our debt as a percentage of total liabilities and capital was 
this debt of  includes our credit facility debt with a principal amount of  and a promissory note payable to nhc with a principal amount of  the credit facility bears interest at variable rates  currently at the eurodollar rate plus at december  
the promissory note bears interest at the day libor plus with a floor of 
the million credit facility matures december  and the million promissory note matures december  in order to address the december  maturity of our million credit facility  we plan to obtain proceeds from note receivable maturities due us see fcc notes below  from the refinancing of certain assets through first mortgage notes with community banks  and from refinancing with our existing lenders 
although we believe that we will be successful in refinancing our obligations  no assurance can be given in this regard 
our cash flows from operating activities will not be adequate to meet these entire obligations 
the inability to obtain adequate refinancing prior to december  would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
leases we lease our health care facilities to various lessees properties are leased to nhc  and nine properties that were previously leased to nhc are leased to nine separate lessees not related to nhc 
with respect to these nine properties  nhc remains obligated under its master lease agreement and continues to remain obligated to make the lease payments to us 
lease payments made to us from the new lessees are credited against nhc s overall rent obligation 
at december   all payments are current 
our leases with nhc have initial ten year terms with provisions for two five year renewal terms at the same terms as the original lease 
our leases with the nine separate lessees have initial five year terms with provisions for two five year renewal terms for which the base lease payments must be negotiated on each renewal 
transfer of notes receivable to nhi effective december   we sold at par three mortgage notes receivable for  to nhi 
we received cash from nhi equal to our carrying amount 
as the result of the repurchase and put options included in the sale agreement  consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  we accounted for the transfer of notes receivable to nhi as a borrowing from nhi rather than as a sale of the notes 
effective december   nhr exercised its right to repurchase the notes at par for approximately  from nhi 
consequently  the borrowing from nhi is not recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the notes bear interest at a blended floating rate which was on december  funds to purchase the notes were borrowed from nhc at a floating rate with a floor of 
the rate was on december  fcc notes of the  of mortgage and other notes receivable recorded on our balance sheet at december    is due from florida convalescent centers  inc fcc of sarasota  florida 
the fcc notes bear interest at and substantially all of the notes mature october  approximately  of fcc notes were prepaid november  the proceeds of the prepayments were used to pay down our credit facility 
the balance of the fcc notes may be prepaid without penalty 
if repayment occurs  our existing line of credit requires the repayments to be used to reduce our bank debt 
in the event that we use any prepayments to pay down existing debt  a reduction of our cash flow will result 
however  no dividend reductions are expected in the near future 
effective july   the fcc centers securing the fcc notes were leased to integrated health systems  inc ihs  which filed for bankruptcy protection on february  pursuant to court order  the ihs lease was terminated and the fcc centers re leased to schwartzberg associates  a private multi state long term care company  during the second quarter of the ability of fcc to service the mortgage notes held by us is dependent on schwartzberg associates ability to make its lease payments to fcc or upon fcc s ability to refinance the notes payable to us upon maturity 
our payments from fcc are current as of december  hsmi sale effective january   we sold all of the real estate and equipment of the three long term health care centers under lease to the lessee  health services management of indiana  llc hsmi 
consideration for the sale and assumption of the  first mortgage and the properties is in the form of new mortgage notes in the total amount of  we accounted for this transaction under the deposit method in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas 
consistent with the deposit method  we did not initially record the sale of the assets and we continued to record depreciation expense related to the assets 
cash received from the buyer which since the sale totaled  as of october  was reported as a deposit on real estate properties sold until the period in which the down payment and continuing investment criteria of sfas were met  at which time we would account for the sale under the full accrual method 
during  we concluded that based on our impairment analysis in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas and based on certain events  these real estate properties required write downs in the amount of  as such  write downs of  and  were recorded during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
effective november   the initial and continuing investment criteria of sfas were met 
therefore  the sale of the real estate properties was recorded resulting in a gain on the sale of real estate of approximately  the sale of the assets resulted in recording a mortgage notes receivable of approximately  sources and uses of funds our leasing and mortgage services generated net cash from operating activities during in the amount of  compared to  in the prior period 
net cash from operating activities generally includes net income plus non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization and provisions for realty and loan losses  if any  and non cash gains on sales of real estate  if any  and working capital changes 
the year to year decrease is due primarily to reduced mortgage interest income and increased interest expense 
our investing activities provided  of cash flows in compared to  in collections and sales of mortgage notes receivable totaled  in compared to  in included in these collections are  of prepayments of mortgage notes receivable in compared to prepayment of  in deposits on real estate properties sold provided  of cash flow this year compared to  in the prior year

cash flows used in financing activities included  to pay dividends to stockholders  last year   to pay cash distributions to minority partners of our operating partnership  last year  and  to payment of financing costs in the prior year none in the current year 
commitments we intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount at least sufficient to satisfy the distribution requirements of a real estate investment trust 
such requirements necessitate that at least of our taxable income be distributed annually 
the primary source for distributions will be rental and interest income we earn on the real property and mortgage notes receivable 
regular dividends in the amount of and a special dividend in the amount of

therefore  there is no longer any potential liability on our part for any default by national or nhc on any of their outstanding debt 
our contractual cash obligations for periods subsequent to december  are as follows less than in thousands total year years years after years long term debt    total contractual cash obligations    we expect that current cash on hand  marketable securities  short term notes receivable  operating cash flows  and as needed  our borrowing capacity will be adequate to finance our operating and financing requirements for and results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  is  versus  for the same period in  an increase of

to  from  for the year ended december  revenues from rental income increased  or when compared to the same period in revenues from mortgage interest decreased  or in as compared to the same period in gain on sale of real estate increased  the increase in rental income is due primarily to the recognition of  of additional percentage rent 
percentage rent is calculated as of the amount by which gross revenues of each leased health care facility in each quarter of each year after exceed the gross revenues of such health care facility in the applicable quarter of the decrease in mortgage interest income is the result of lower balances of notes receivable 
we received prepayments on mortgages receivable totaling  in november and totaling  in december mortgage interest income decreased also because of reductions in the principal of the mortgage notes receivable due to regular monthly amortization 
the gain on sale of real estate is the result of recording the sale of indiana properties effective november  total expenses for the year ended december  decreased  or to  from  for the year ended december  interest expense increased  or in as compared to the period 
depreciation of real estate decreased  or 
general and administrative costs increased  or 
realty and loan losses  in the current year  were  in the prior year 
interest expense increased due primarily to the recognition of interest expense on a  obligation to nhi which started in december  offset by reduced interest expenses on the credit facility 
the reduced interest on the credit facility was caused by paydowns in december and december in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
the reduction of interest on the credit facility was offset in part due to an increased rate effective january  during  we concluded that based on our statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas impairment analysis and on certain events  certain real estate properties required write downs in the net book value of  write downs of  and  were recorded during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
it is possible that additional events could occur that  if adverse to nhr  would indicate a further impairment of the net carrying amount of these real estate properties 
if such adverse events occur  we will record additional losses in the period the events occur or become known

total revenues for the year ended december  increased  or 
to  from  for the year ended december  revenues from rental income increased  or when compared to the same period in revenues from mortgage interest decreased  or in as compared to the same period in the increase in rental income is due primarily to the recognition of  of percentage rent and due to receipt of  of past due rent receivable from a prior year 
percentage rent is calculated as of the amount by which gross revenues of each leased health care facility in each quarter of each year after exceed the gross revenues of such health care facility in the applicable quarter of the decrease in mortgage interest income resulted from reductions in the principal of the mortgage notes receivable 
total expenses for the year ended december  increased  or to  from  for the year ended december  interest expense decreased  or in as compared to the period 
depreciation of real estate decreased  or 
general and administrative costs decreased  or 
realty and loan losses increased  interest expense decreased due to a decrease in the interest rate of variable rate debt compared to a year ago and  to a lesser extent  due to payments of principal on long term debt 
we concluded that based on our statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas impairment analysis and on certain events  certain real estate properties required write downs in the net book value of  write downs of  and  were recorded during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
we believe that the carrying amount of these assets of  at december  is realizable 
it is possible that additional events could occur that  if adverse to nhr  would indicate a further impairment of the net carrying amount of these real estate properties 
if such adverse events occur  we will record additional losses in the period the events occur or become known 
during  we recovered  principal and accrued interest which had been written off in the prior year 
funds from operations we have adopted the definition of funds from operations ffo prescribed by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit october white paper as amended april accordingly  ffo is defined as net income loss applicable to common stockholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation of real property and after investments for unconsolidated entities in which a reit holds an interest 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows form operations  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
we view ffo as a measure of operating performance and believe that ffo is helpful in evaluating a real estate investment portfolio s overall performance considering the fact that historical cost accounting implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
in october  nareit informed its member companies that the sec has taken the position that asset impairment charges should not be excluded in calculating ffo 
previously  the sec accepted nareit s view that impairment charges are effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of property and thus should be excluded from ffo similar to other gains and losses on sales 
however  the sec s current interpretation is that recurring impairment charges on real property are not an appropriate adjustment 
based on the sec s interpretation  we have restated our prior year ffo amounts to exclude impairment charges 
this modification of ffo does not impact our net income 
the following table reconciles net income loss applicable to common stockholders to funds from to operations applicable to common stockholders in thousands  except share and per share amounts year ended december  net income    adjustments real estate depreciation    gain on sale of real estate  minority interest in nhr op  lp s share of add back for real estate related depreciation and gain on sale of real estate funds from operations applicable to common stockholders   basic funds from operations per share diluted funds from operations per share weighted average shares basic    diluted    future rental and mortgage interest income uncertainties our rental and mortgage interest income revenues are believed by management to be secure 
however  the majority of the income of our lessees and borrowers is derived from the lessees participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
adverse changes in these programs or the inability of our lessees and borrowers to participate in these programs would have a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of our lessees and borrowers and their resultant ability to service their obligations to us 
none of our lessees or borrowers are in bankruptcy  but the facilities that secure the fcc notes were initially leased by fcc to integrated health systems  inc ihs  which filed for bankruptcy protection february  by court order  the lease was terminated in fcc immediately re leased the properties to schwartzberg associates  a private  multi state long term care company 
the ability of fcc to service the mortgage notes held by us is initially dependent on schwartzberg associates ability to make its lease payments to fcc or  in the absence of lease payments  fcc s ability to operate or release these facilities 
all fcc note payments are current as of december  refer also to the above section fcc notes for information concerning the short term maturities of  of notes receivable 
income taxes we intend at all times to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
therefore  we will not be subject to federal income tax provided we distribute at least of our annual reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet other requirements to continue to qualify as a reit 
accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been made in the consolidated financial statements 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements during august  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and supersedes certain existing accounting literature  which literature we currently use to evaluate the recoverability of our real estate properties 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  the implementation of sfas has not had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is generally effective for nhr july  as originally issued  sfas would have required nhr to measure the minority interests in nhr op  lp on the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value at the balance sheet date  with a charge or credit to income specifically  interest expense for the change in carrying value during the period 
in november  the fasb deferred for an indefinite period the application of the classification and measurement guidance in sfas to noncontrolling interests in limited life subsidiaries such as nhr op  lp measurement of the minority interests in nhr op  lp at estimated fair value at each balance sheet date  if and when required  would result in significant volatility in nhr s financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that the guarantor recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantees 
fin also requires additional disclosure requirements about the guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  through december   adoption of fin has not had a material effect on nhr s financial statements 
the future effect of fin on nhr s financial statements will depend on whether we enter into new or modify existing guarantees 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin is generally applicable to nhr effective march  disclosures are required currently if the company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities 
the company is currently evaluating the requirement to consolidate any additional material entities as a result of fin impact of inflation inflation may affect us in the future by changing the underlying value of our real estate or by impacting our cost of financing operations 
our revenues are primarily from long term investments 
our leases with nhc require increases in rent income based on increases in the revenues of the leased facilities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months 
substantially all of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investment in notes receivable are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
as of december    of our long term debt bears interest at floating interest rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of  and a reduction in interest rates would result in annual interest expense declining  the remaining  of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
we currently do not use any derivative instruments to hedge interest rate or other risks 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the future use of such instruments would be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
therefore  our exposure related to such derivative instruments is not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
equity price risk we consider our investments in marketable securities as available for sale securities and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
hypothetically  a increase in quoted market prices would result in a related increase in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities of a  and reduction in quoted market prices would result in a related decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities of approximately
