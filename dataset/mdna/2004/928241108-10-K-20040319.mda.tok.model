item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we are a development stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products that address serious diseases treated by physician specialists and in hospital settings 
since commencing operations in december  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our product development programs  debt service  business development  sales and marketing activities and our former early stage research activities 
we have generated no revenues from sales of our own products and have been dependent upon funding primarily from equity and debt financing 
we have not been profitable from product sales since inception and have incurred a cumulative net loss of million through december  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  write off of acquired technology rights  general and administrative expenses  debt service and sales and marketing expenses 
we expect to incur additional operating and net losses over the next several years 
strategic direction in january  we redefined our strategic direction to focus on development of later stage opportunities  to build specific franchises relating to our current development programs and to expand our product portfolio through the acquisition of complementary late stage or commercial product opportunities as a means to accelerate our path toward becoming a profitable pharmaceutical company 
we intend to build franchises within narrowly focused prescribing groups 
initially we will focus on the transplant  hepatology and gastroenterology areas  using our clinical programs in cytomegalovirus cmv infections related to hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplantation  and hepatitis c hcv  as foundations for that effort 
our cmv product candidate maribavir  or vp entered phase clinical studies in january we expect to initiate phase studies with maribavir in the second quarter of viropharma and wyeth initiated phase clinical trials of our lead product candidate for the treatment of hepatitis c in february we intend to pursue aggressively in licensing or other means of acquiring products in a late stage of clinical development  or that are currently on the market but are under promoted or not currently promoted 
we plan to seek products for diseases treated by physician specialists and in hospital settings to complement the markets that we hope our cmv and hcv programs will serve 
strategic risks and uncertainties we may not be successful in implementing our strategic direction 
there are a variety of risks and uncertainties that we face in executing this strategy 
we will face intense competition in acquiring products to expand our product portfolio 
many of the companies and institutions that we will compete with in acquiring products to expand our product portfolio have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and substantially greater experience in conducting business development activities 
in implementing our strategic objectives  we expect to have sufficient cash available at the beginning of to fund our current business operations and debt service requirements until at least the end of however  the results of our business development efforts could cause our actual results to significantly deviate from this estimate 
we may need additional financing in order to acquire new products in connection with our plans as described in this report 
we are currently working to restructure our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
even if we are successful in such restructuring  our outstanding convertible notes may make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing 
we may not have sufficient resources to execute our plans  and our actual expenses over the period described in this report may vary depending on a variety of factors  including the cost of acquiring new product opportunities as a result of our business development efforts  the actual cost of conducting clinical trials  
table of contents the outcome of clinical trials in our cmv  hcv and intranasal pleconaril programs  and our resulting right to receive or obligation to pay milestone payments under agreements relating to those programs  and the costs associated with ongoing litigation 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on developing and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  successfully commercializing such product candidates which may include entering into collaborative agreements for product development and commercialization  and securing contract manufacturing services and distribution and logistics services 
we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our debt service obligations beyond recent developments in january  we announced that we began to implement our strategic decision to focus on later stage opportunities 
as part of this process  we substantially discontinued our early stage activities  including discovery research and most internal preclinical development activities 
we also made reductions in clinical development and general and administrative personnel 
we will complete certain discrete efforts related to our early stage programs in order to finalize the transition 
upon completion of these activities in mid  we will have reduced our workforce by approximately overall 
we estimate that approximately million of costs related to this restructuring will be included in viropharma s financial results 
our discontinuation of our early stage activities requires us to wind down our biodefense program in the coming months as part of the transition 
we also ceased efforts to develop pleconaril for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases as part of this restructuring 
we will continue to conduct initial studies of an intranasal formulation of pleconaril for the treatment of the common cold under our option agreement with schering 
we also will continue our hcv development efforts under our collaboration with wyeth 
we initiated phase clinical trials with maribavir  our cmv product candidate in january together with wyeth  we initiated phase clinical trials of our lead product candidate for the treatment of hepatitis c in february key events in november  we entered into an agreement granting schering corporation an option to license our intranasal formulation of the antiviral compound pleconaril for the treatment of the common cold in the united states and canada 
schering paid us an upfront option fee of million  and we are conducting a series of clinical studies to evaluate the antiviral activity  safety and other performance characteristics of the new intranasal pleconaril formulation 
after assessing the product s performance in the characterization studies  schering has the option to enter into a full license agreement with us under which schering would assume responsibility for all future development and commercialization of intranasal pleconaril in the united states and canada 
if schering chooses to exercise its option  we expect to receive an initial license fee of million and schering will purchase our existing inventory of bulk drug substance for an additional pre determined fee 
we would also be eligible to receive additional milestone payments upon achievement of certain targeted events as well as royalties on schering s sales of intranasal pleconaril in the licensed territory 
there is no assurance that schering will exercise its option to continue with the development and commercialization of an intranasal formulation of pleconaril 
schering s failure to exercise this option may cause us to abandon development work on this indication 
also in november  we further amended our agreement with sanofi synthelabo in connection with our entry into the option agreement with schering corporation in respect of intranasal pleconaril 
if schering exercises its option to continue the development and commercialization of pleconaril  the november amendment  among other things  reduces the royalty rate applicable to future product sales  if any  used to calculate royalties payable to sanofi synthelabo 

table of contents in august  we announced the acquisition of worldwide rights excluding japan from glaxosmithkline to an antiviral compound maribavir  or vp that is an inhibitor of cytomegalovirus cmv 
maribavir is a benzimidazole compound that was originally intended as a treatment for cmv retinitis  and phase data from studies previously conducted by glaxosmithkline demonstrated antiviral effect and a favorable safety profile 
under the terms of the agreement  we have exclusive worldwide rights excluding japan to develop and commercialize maribavir for the prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus infections related to transplant including solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  congenital transmission  and in patients with hiv infection 
we plan to focus initially on patients who have undergone allogenic stem cell eg  bone marrow transplantation 
we paid glaxosmithkline a million licensing fee upon entering into the agreement and may pay additional milestones based upon the successful outcome of certain clinical development and regulatory events 
we also may pay royalties to glaxosmithkline and its licensor on product sales  if any  in the united states and the rest of the world excluding japan 
this product candidate currently is in phase clinical studies  and we expect to initiate a phase clinical trial in the second quarter of the million up front licensing fee was recorded as an acquisition of technology rights expense during  as the underlying technology has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative uses 
in june  we amended our hcv collaboration agreement with wyeth to  among other things  focus the parties screening activity on one target  to allocate more of the collaboration s pre development efforts to viropharma subject to our cost sharing arrangement with wyeth for this work  and to clarify certain of the reconciliation and reimbursement provisions of the collaboration agreement 
in addition  under the amended agreement both companies are permitted to work outside the collaboration on screening against targets other than the target being addressed together under the collaboration 
in connection with our restructuring in january  we and wyeth agreed to cease screening compounds against hcv under our collaboration 
in march and may  complaints were filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against us seeking an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of an alleged class of persons who purchased shares of our common stock at various times between july  and march  in july  the complaints were consolidated into a single action 
the consolidated complaint names us  as well as certain of our directors and officers  as defendants 
the consolidated complaint alleges that we and or such directors and officers violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting and failing to disclose certain information regarding picovir pleconaril 
in august  we filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint 
in april  the court granted in part and denied in part the company s motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint 
in december  we filed a motion for partial summary judgment of this action and a memorandum opposing the certification of the plaintiffs class action status 
in march  we entered into an agreement in principle with plaintiffs counsel to settle this litigation 
the proposed settlement will be paid from our insurance coverage and will not result in the payment of any funds by us 
however  the proposed settlement is subject to the approval of the court 
if the proposed settlement is not approved by the court  then the range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against us or our directors or officers or settlements that could require substantial payments by us  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
these proceedings might require substantial attention of our management team and therefore divert time and attention from our business and operations 
liquidity and capital resources other than detailing fees from discontinued sales operations earned in the first eight months of for promoting products owned by aventis  we have not generated revenues from product sales 
we expect that our near term source of revenue will arise from milestone and license fee payments that we may receive from wyeth and schering if we achieve agreed upon events under our agreements with each of these companies 
however  there are no assurances that we can achieve the events that require payments to us under the wyeth and schering arrangements 
the cash flows we have used in operations historically have been applied to research and development activities  marketing and business development efforts  general and administrative expenses  and servicing our debt 
the process of bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase  phase  and phase clinical trials and fda approval is a time consuming and expensive process 
because our 
table of contents product candidates are currently in the preclinical and clinical stages of development  there are a variety of events that could occur during the development process that will dictate the course we must take with our drug development efforts and the cost of these efforts 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs that we will incur through the commercialization of any product candidate 
nonetheless  we expect that the most significant uses of our near term operating cash flows will be development activities in our cmv program through december   we have not incurred material expenses in connection with this program  other than the acquisition fee of million paid to gsk for the rights to maribavir vp 
during  we expect to spend between million and million for research and development activities for the development of maribivir 
these activities include phase studies with maribavir  initiated in january  and a phase study that we expect to initiate during the second quarter of the results of these studies will significantly impact the timing and the amount of expenses  including potential milestone payments to gsk  we incur related to this program in future years 
in addition  discussions with the fda regarding planned future studies may impact the timing  nature and cost of future planned studies 
we are solely responsible for the cost of developing our cmv product candidate 
should we achieve certain product development events  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to glaxosmithkline  the licensor of maribavir predevelopment and development activities with our hcv program during we expect to spend between million and million on predevelopment and development activities 
the planned activities include a phase clinical trial in our hcv program  initiated in february  a phase b clinical trial and other predevelopment activities 
these activities are performed in collaboration with wyeth  who pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s predevelopment and development expenses 
the results of the planned studies  along with other predevelopment activities performed during the year  will significantly impact the timing and amount of expenses we will incur related to this program in future years 
should we achieve certain product development events  wyeth is required to pay us certain cash milestones and to purchase  in cash  our common stock pursuant to terms of our collaboration agreement 
based on the activities planned by wyeth and us  there is the potential to achieve these milestones in or business development activities during  we intend to seek new opportunities to expand our pipeline 
the costs associated with acquiring any particular product candidate can vary substantially based upon market size of the product  the commercial effort required for the product  the product s current stage of development  the market s potential for generic competition and the market s barriers to non generic competition  among other factors 
due to the variability of the cost of acquiring a product candidate  it is not feasible to predict what our actual acquisition costs would be  however  the costs could be substantial 
intranasal pleconaril we are conducting studies intended to evaluate the safety  antiviral activity and other performance characteristics of an intranasal formulation of pleconaril which we began development of in we expect these activities to be completed in mid in the third quarter of  we received million under our option agreement with schering corporation schering which we will use to fund these studies 
we do not expect the costs of the studies to exceed the payment made by schering during should schering choose to enter into a license agreement with us  schering will be solely responsible for the future development and commercialization of pleconaril  and we could receive an upfront payment of million in  as well as an additional pre determined fee for our existing inventory of bulk drug substance 
in addition  should schering be successful in commercializing the intranasal formulation of pleconaril  we would receive royalties and milestones related to future product sales  if any 
general and administrative activities we expect to spend between and million on general and administrative activities in this includes costs related to unused office space that we are actively looking to sub lease 
payment of our debt service requirements annual interest payments on our outstanding million convertible subordinated notes due total million 

table of contents we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive material net cash inflows from our product candidates 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including the achievement of milestones and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by efforts of our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug candidates  our collaborative partners may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products  when and if appoved  or they may not successfully market these products 
through december   we have used approximately million of cash in operating activities 
we invest our cash in short term investments 
through december   we have used approximately million in investing activities  including million in short term investments and million in equipment purchases and new construction 
through december   we have financed our operations primarily through private and public offerings of common stock  a convertible subordinated notes offering  private placements of redeemable preferred stock  two bank loans and equipment lease lines totaling approximately million  net of approximately million used to repurchase million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due  and  shares of our common stock in exchange for the surrender of million in face amount of such notes 
during the twelve months ended december  we used approximately million of cash in operating activities 
we invest our cash in short term investments 
for the twelve months ended december   cash provided by investing activities was approximately million  including million from short term investments  net of million in equipment purchases 
for the twelve months ended december   we have used approximately million of cash in financing activities  which primarily relates to million in cash used to repurchase million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating approximately million 
also  at december  the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate on our short term investments was approximately 
future contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  are as follows contractual obligations payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total we lease an aggregate of  square feet in two facilities for our corporate and development activities under operating leases expiring in and  respectively 
we also have the right  under certain circumstances  to purchase the facility leased through during the third quarter of  we determined that we would not utilize  square feet of this aggregate leased space and we recognized a non cash charge of approximately million in our general and administrative expenses relating to this space 
following our restructuring in january  we further reduced our space requirements and will record the appropriate non cash charge relating to our facilities in we are currently seeking to sublease all unused space 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to sublease our unused space on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents as a result of our restructuring in january  particularly the discontinuation of our early stage activities  we expect our monthly expenses and operating losses in to be lower than we experienced during  and we expect to have sufficient cash available at the beginning of to fund our current business operations and debt service requirements until at least the end of we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our debt service and other obligations beyond to obtain this financing  we intend to access the public or private equity or debt markets or enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue shares of our stock 
we have an effective form s universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the potential additional issuance of up to approximately million of our securities 
the registration statement provides us with the flexibility to determine the type of security we choose to sell  including common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities  as well as the ability to time such sales when market conditions are favorable 
in order for us to issue securities registered on this registration statement we must either have an aggregate market value of the voting and non voting common equity excluding shares held by our affiliates of million or more as of the date of our most recently filed annual report on form k  or we must file a post effective amendment to the registration statement on form s or s if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
additional financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result of  among other factors  our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due  our inability to achieve regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  our inability to generate revenue through our existing collaborative agreements  the existence of pending litigation involving allegations of securities fraud  and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce any patent claim and or other intellectual property rights 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current development programs  or reduce or eliminate other aspects of our business 
additionally  wyeth is required to purchase our common stock at the time of successful completion of certain product development events pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement 
however  in the event we are not able to successfully achieve the product development events  this additional financing would not be available to us 
in order to improve our capital structure  we are currently working to restructure our existing outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
through december  we have reduced the principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in by million and the outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated notes payable at december  is million 
we have purchased an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes for approximately million in cash through december  in october and november  we entered into agreements with a third party under which we issued a total of  shares of our common stock in exchange for the surrender of million of face amount of our convertible subordinated notes held by such third party 
as a result of our reduction of million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes through december   our annual interest expense will be reduced by approximately million when compared to our original issuance interest expense 
a restructuring of the notes may involve significant dilution of the ownership of existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure these notes on favorable terms or at all  or that we will be able to effect future purchases of any additional notes at prices favorable to us  or at all 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and 
table of contents expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical policies and practices are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our financial statements included in item of this form k 
due to the nature of our business and our stage of development  we do not currently face the many complex or subjective judgments that face companies that are further along in their life cycle that may be necessary in applying accounting policies 
however  we consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows stock based employee compensation we apply apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb in accounting for all stock based employee compensation 
we have elected to adopt only the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
had we applied sfas our net loss allocable to common stockholders for the years ended december   and would have been increased by approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
revenue recognition our revenue from collaborative agreements consists of up front fees  and milestone payments 
we recognize revenues from these agreements consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
non refundable upfront fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement  but the actual performance period may vary 
we adjust the performance periods based on available facts and circumstances 
contract milestone payments related to the achievement of substantive steps or regulatory events in the development process are recognized as revenues upon the completion of the milestone event or requirement 
restructuring charges in  we had costs for which we applied statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
these costs related to exiting activities for which there was significant subjectivity and judgment and their impact on our financial condition was material 
during  we recorded a million charge related to an operating lease for office space for which we did not expect to utilize in the foreseeable future 
the charge was an estimate of the present value of the loss we will incur over the remaining life of the lease  which is years  net of assumed sublease income of million beginning in the fourth quarter of management used assumptions in calculating this estimate  including operating and maintenance costs  lease payments and sublease income derived from this office space 
should we negotiate higher than expected sublease rental income agreements  reach a settlement with our lessors to be released from our existing obligations  or should our space requirements change we could realize a favorable benefit to our results of future operations 
should future lease  maintenance or other costs related to these facilities exceed our estimates  we could incur additional expenses in future periods 
following our restructuring in january  we further reduced our space requirements and will record an appropriate charge consistent with sfas  as necessary  at the cease use date for the facility we currently occupy 
we also will reduce the liability recorded in related to office space that we previously believed we would not occupy 
we currently expect to move into a portion of this space in the second quarter of we are currently seeking to sublease all planned unused space to third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to sublease our planned unused space on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents as we progress in our development and move closer to product approval and commercial operations  we may face additional issues that will require increased levels of management estimation and complex judgments 
results of operations years ended december  and the net loss allocable to common stockholders increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  net loss allocable to common stockholders per share for the year ended december  was per share compared to a loss allocable to common stockholders of per share for the same period in the loss from continuing operation increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  loss per share from continuing operations for the year ended december  was per share compared to a loss per share from continuing operations of per share for the same period in during the year ended december   the company recognized a gain of million  net of the write off of million in deferred financing costs  related to the reduction of million in principal of its outstanding convertible subordinated notes due during the year ended december   the company recognized a gain of million  net of the write off of million in deferred financing costs  related to the reduction of million in principal of its outstanding convertible subordinated notes due revenues from continuing operations were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million during the same period in during the year ended december   we recognized license fee and milestone revenue from advance payments received under our collaborations with wyeth and schering that totaled million and million  respectively

in september  we paid glaxosmithkline a million license fee in connection with our agreement for the worldwide rights excluding japan to maribavir  or vp  an inhibitor of cytomegalovirus cmv 
this fee was recognized as an acquisition of technology rights and was expensed during during the year ended december   we had no marketing expenses 
during the same period in  we incurred million in marketing expenses related to pleconaril as a result of our joint marketing efforts with aventis pharmaceuticals inc this reduction is due to the termination of the collaboration with aventis in august of the marketing costs incurred during  million related to a restructuring severance charge  and the remaining million represented pleconaril marketing costs 
general and administrative expenses for of approximately million increased million when compared to the million from the same period in the increase is primarily due to a non cash charge of million for a lease associated with our unused office space  and million in expenses related to business development efforts undertaken during these additional costs are offset by a million reduction in general and administrative compensation expenses  a million reduction in severance costs related to the august restructuring  and a reduction in other general and administrative expenses 
interest expense for decreased to million from million in the same period in the prior year due to the reduction of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in and the fourth quarter of interest income fell approximately million to million during when compared to the same period in primarily due to lower invested balances and lower effective yields on investments due to the relatively lower interest rate environment during the current year versus the prior year
