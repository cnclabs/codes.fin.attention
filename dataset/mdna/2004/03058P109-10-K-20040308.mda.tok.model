table of contents americanwest bancorporation bank awb  a washington state chartered commercial bank  conducts its banking business through thirty four branches and two lending offices located in communities throughout eastern washington  including spokane  and eight branches in northern idaho 
awb offers a full range of financial services to commercial and individual customers  including short term and medium term loans  revolving credit facilities  inventory and accounts receivable financing  equipment financing  residential and small commercial construction lending  agricultural lending  mortgage lending  equipment leasing  various savings programs  checking accounts  installment and personal loans  and bank credit cards 
the bank also provides a broad range of depository and lending services to commercial  industrial and agricultural enterprises  governmental entities  not for profit entities and individuals 
the bank s deposit taking and lending activities are primarily directed to the communities in which their branches are located 
awb s primary marketing focus is on small to medium sized businesses  professionals and consumers in these communities 
business strategy awbc s business strategy is to continue to build a growing  profitable community banking and financial services network by emphasizing high quality customer service and by focusing on the financial needs of consumers and small to medium sized businesses 
awbc intends to pursue a growth strategy  the key components of which include providing superior customer service increasing market share in existing markets expanding the markets served through new branch openings and acquisitions increase market share in existing markets 
since its formation awbc has focused on commercial banking to small and medium sized businesses  professionals and other individuals 
management believes that awbc can continue to gain market share by targeting products and services to these businesses and consumers 
awbc emphasizes the development of long term relationships with its customers  which enables the bank to develop and offer new products that meet its customers needs 
awbc is actively involved in the communities it serves 
awbc believes this community orientation gives a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining targeted customers 
the consolidation of the banking industry in recent years has resulted in centralized loan approval in the larger financial institutions with which awbc competes 
this has frequently resulted in inconvenience and reduced service to small business and individual customers of these institutions  and in management s opinion has created opportunities for smaller  locally focused institutions  such as community banks  which can approve credit and offer other customized banking services within each branch 
awbc maintains local loan officers having the authority to approve loans subject to the bank s lending policies 
see lending activities lending and credit management 
expand markets served through new branch openings and acquisitions 
awbc intends to expand its presence in washington  idaho and oregon by opening new branches and possibly acquiring other financial institutions 
management considers a variety of criteria in evaluating potential branch expansion  including the demographics and short and long term growth prospects for the location  the management and other resources needed to integrate the branch into its existing operations  the degree to which the branch would enhance the geographic diversity of awbc or would enhance the presence in an existing market  and the estimated cost of opening and operating the branch as compared to the cost of acquiring an existing office and deposit base 

table of contents americanwest bancorporation in addition to internal growth  there may be attractive opportunities to grow awbc through carefully selected acquisitions of other financial institutions or their branches in washington  oregon and idaho 
awbc s ability to make future acquisitions depends on several factors such as the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  necessary regulatory and shareholder approval  and compliance with applicable capital requirements and  in the case of cash acquisitions  on its cash assets or ability to acquire cash 
awbc may need to obtain additional debt and equity capital in pursuing an acquisition strategy 
awbc s access to capital markets or the costs of this capital can be impacted by economic  financial  competitive and other conditions beyond awbc s control 
further  acquisition candidates may not be available in the future on favorable terms 
therefore  no assurance can be made that future acquisitions will occur 
provide superior customer service 
awbc attributes its success to its efforts to offer superior  personal service through professional bankers at all of its branches 
awbc believes that it distinguishes itself in its markets by emphasizing a culture in which customers are the highest priority 
ongoing employee training is focused on customer needs  responsiveness and courtesy 
lending activities awbc s loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans  agricultural loans  real estate mortgage loans  residential real estate and other construction loans  consumer installment loans and bankcard loans 
at december   awbc had total gross loans outstanding of million  which equals of awbc s deposits and of its assets 
the majority of the loans held by awbc were to borrowers within the bank s principal market areas 
see loan category amounts for five years in item  selected financial data 
commercial loans 
commercial loans primarily consist of loans to businesses for various purposes  including revolving lines of credit  equipment financing loans and letters of credit 
these loans generally mature within five years  have adjustable rates and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable  equipment or real estate 
commercial construction loans and loans secured by multifamily five or more residential properties are also classified as commercial loans 
these loans are primarily secured by liens on real estate  capital assets  accounts receivable and inventory  although certain loans are unsecured 
commercial lending has increased risks as a result of dependence on income production for future repayment  and in certain circumstances  the lack of tangible collateral 
commercial loans are underwritten based on the financial strength and repayment ability of the borrower  as well as the value of any collateral securing the loans 
commercial lending operations rely on a strong credit culture that combines prudent credit policies and individual lender accountability 
agricultural loans 
agricultural loans primarily consist of farm loans to finance operating expenses 
these loans generally mature within one year  have adjustable rates and are secured by farm real estate  equipment  crops or livestock 
since agricultural loans present certain risks not associated with other types of lending  ordinarily the policy of awbc is to make such loans only to agricultural producers with diverse crops  thereby mitigating the risk of loss attributable to a crop failure or the deterioration of commodity prices 
mortgage loans 
mortgage loans include various types of loans for which real property is held as collateral 
these loans include adjustable and fixed rate first mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties  and second mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties 
mortgage loans typically mature in one to five years and require payments on amortization schedules ranging from one year to twenty years 
construction loans 
construction loans are made to individuals and contractors to construct primarily single family principal residences 
these loans typically have maturities of twelve months 
interest rates are typically fixed  although some adjustable rate loans are made 
the bank s policies normally require that a permanent financing commitment be in place before a construction loan is made to an individual 
table of contents americanwest bancorporation borrower 
construction loans may involve additional risks because loan funds are collateralized by the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion 
delays may arise from labor problems  material shortages may be experienced and other unpredictable contingencies may occur 
it is important to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios 
because of these factors  the analysis of prospective construction loan projects requires an expertise that is different in significant respects from the expertise required for real estate mortgage lending 
construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of collateral risk than long term financing of residential properties 
awbc s risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value and marketability at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost including interest of construction 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment 
awbc s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each real estate construction loan 
among other things  awbc considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing for the borrower  the reputation of the borrower  the amount of the borrower s equity in the project  the independent appraisal and review of cost estimates  the pre construction sale and leasing information  and the cash flow projections of the borrower 
installment and other loans 
installment loans are primarily automobile  bankcard and personal loans 
consumer loans generally have maturities of five years or less  and fixed interest rates 
consumer lending may involve special risks  including decreases in the value of collateral and transaction costs associated with foreclosure and repossession 
interest rates 
the interest rates earned on loans vary with the degree of risk and amount of the loan  and are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  the availability of funds and government regulations 
approximately of the loans in the bank s portfolio have interest rates that float with the lending bank s reference rates  which are in turn based on various indices such as the rates of interest charged by money center banks 
lending and credit management 
the bank follows loan policies 
the policies establish levels of loan commitment by loan type  credit review and grading criteria  and cover other matters such as loan administration  loans to affiliates  costs  problem loans and loan loss reserves  and related items 
loans are analyzed at origination and on a periodic basis as conditions warrant as outlined in the bank s loan policies 
all loan applications are processed at awbc s branch lending offices 
designated bank officers follow approved guidelines and underwriting policies to approve all loan applications 
credit limits generally vary according to the type of loan and the individual loan officer s experience 
the maximum current loan approval limits available to any one individual vary from  to million per loan 
under applicable federal and state law  permissible loans to one borrower by awb are limited 
the bank  as a matter of policy  does not extend credit to any single borrower in excess of million 
at december   and  the outstanding balance of loan participations sold outside awb was million  million and million  respectively 
secondary mortgage sales 
the bank sells mortgage loans in the secondary market as a correspondent and as a broker 
the bank offers a variety of products for refinance and purchases  and is approved to originate fha and va loans 
the majority of loans originated in were fixed rate single family loans 
total loans sold in were approximately million 
approximately of such loans were sold with servicing retained during 
table of contents americanwest bancorporation nonperforming assets 
the following table provides information for the bank s nonperforming assets 
year ended december  in thousands nonperforming loans nonaccrual loans accrual loans days or more past due total nonperforming loans other real estate owned and other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans the bank s nonperforming loans consist of nonaccruing loans and accruing loans days or more past due 
accruing loans days or more past due remain on an accrual basis because they are adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
for nonaccrual loans no interest is taken into income unless received in cash or until such time as the borrower demonstrates an ability to resume payments of principal and interest 
interest previously accrued  but not collected is reversed and charged against income at the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
approximately of the non performing assets as of december  involve three other real estate owned ore assets and four non accruing relationships 
in the ore category  awbc has two ice skating complexes totaling million  both of which are being marketed one as an operating ice arena and the other as a commercial building 
the other ore property is an alzheimer facility at approximately thousand that is being marketed as an elder care facility or commercial offices 
the non accruing relationships include a million retail office complex near downtown spokane that management believes awbc is fully secured 
additionally  a  loan secured by residential lots for development located in yakima is believed to be fully secured and a million restaurant loan in spokane  which is believed to be fully secured 
finally  the last loan is a million purchased participation secured by an ethanol producing facility in south dakota 
the bank believes it is fully secured on this loan as well 
real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value at the date of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis 
after foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the real estate is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
real estate properties and other repossessed assets of the bank had a book value of approximately million as of december   consisting primarily of commercial real estate and equipment 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio of the bank 
the allowance is maintained at levels considered adequate by management to provide for anticipated loan losses  and is based on management s assessment of factors affecting the loan portfolios  including problem loans  business conditions and loss experience  an overall evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and collateral selling costs 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to operations and is reduced by loans charged off  net of any recoveries 
in originating loans the bank recognizes that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary depending on the type of loan  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions  and the quality of the security for the loan 
as a result  the bank maintains an allowance for loan losses by following generally accepted accounting principles outlined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and staff accounting bulletin  selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues 
the bank has established systematic methodologies for the 
table of contents americanwest bancorporation determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance and specific allowances for individual nonperforming loans 
the bank s methodologies  as set forth in its policies and reviewed with the audit committee of the company  include a general allocation based upon measurement of historical losses  anticipated losses and coverage of non performing loans methodology 
the anticipated losses methodology includes assigning specific loss ratings to general loan grading categories  which are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis 
the bank adopted sfas no 
and no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
these accounting pronouncements require specific identification of an allowance for loan loss for an impaired or nonperforming loan 
the bank believes it has established its existing allowances for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition banking regulators may request an additional allowance for loan losses based on their review of the loan portfolio 
also future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  which may result in an increase to the future allowance for loan losses as additional information becomes available 
the bank s management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in the bank s allowances for loan losses as follows years ended december  in thousands balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs commercial agricultural real estate installment other total charge offs recoveries commercial agricultural real estate installment other total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance acquired through acquisition balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period ratio of net charge offs to average loans average loans outstanding during the period

maturities are estimated using payment experience as of december  deposits the bank s primary source of funds has historically been customer deposits 
the bank strives to maintain a high percentage of noninterest bearing deposits  which are low cost funds and result in higher interest margins 
at december    and  the bank s ratios of noninterest bearing deposits to total deposits were   and  respectively 
the bank offers a variety of accounts designed to attract both short term and long term deposits from its customers 
these accounts include negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market investment accounts  savings accounts  and certificates of deposit and other time deposits 
interest bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by management of awb  based on competitive market factors and management s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits consistent with the bank s policies

as of december   these were the inland empire region headquartered in spokane  washington  the columbia region headquartered in kennewick  washington and the palouse north idaho region headquartered in latah  washington 
awbc s branches are located in and near the three largest metropolitan areas in eastern washington  spokane  yakima and the tri cities area comprised of pasco  kennewick and richland and in rural communities in eastern washington and northern idaho 
spokane  with its diversified economy of military  manufacturing  government  health care  construction  financial services  natural resources and retail has generally been stable and impervious to many of the national economic highs and lows 
the yakima valley s major industries center around agriculture and food processing as well as manufacturing and government 
the economy here has suffered due to recent market and production problems with the fruit orchards and related industries 
the tri cities is currently the fastest growing area in washington state 
a new nuclear waste vitrification plant and the jobs it has brought to the area are a major factor in its recent growth 
the bank s branches located in rural towns in eastern washington and northern idaho are in areas with economies that historically have been based on the agricultural  timber  and mining industries or on tourism 
these locations do not provide significant economic growth  but tend to be underserved by the financial industry 

table of contents americanwest bancorporation competition while the bank encounters a great deal of competition in its lending activities  management believes there is less competition in the bank s specialty middle market and neighborhood bank niche than there was a few years ago 
the bank believes that its competitive position has been strengthened by the consolidation in the banking industry  which has resulted in a focus on the larger accounts with less contact between the bank officers and their customers 
the bank s strategy by contrast  is to remain a middle market lender  which maintains close long term relationships with its customers 
the bank competes for deposits and banking business in central and eastern washington from thirty six locations as well as eight locations in north idaho 
the bank s market area encompasses spokane  stevens  ferry  lincoln  pend oreille  franklin  yakima  benton  whitman  grant  walla walla  and columbia counties in washington and kootenai  shoshone  clearwater  benewah  latah and nez perce counties in idaho 
the bank competes against commercial banks  mutual savings banks  credit unions  savings and loans  mortgage companies  and other financial institutions 
the major commercial bank competitors are the regional and national banks that have a branch or branches within the bank s primary trade areas 
management believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the bank s markets include interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans  the range of banking products available  and customer service and support 
although management believes that the bank s products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors  there can be no assurance that the bank can maintain its competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial resources 
employees as of december   awbc and its banking subsidiary had full time equivalent employees 
none of awbc s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
management believes relations with awbc s employees are good 
awbc is located at n 
newport hwy 
spokane  wa and the telephone number is supervision and regulation the following generally refers to certain significant statutes and regulations affecting the industry of its banking subsidiary 
these references are only intended to provide brief summaries and  therefore  are not complete and are qualified by the statutes and regulations referenced 
changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on the business and prospects of awbc 
the operations of awbc may also be affected by changes in the policies of banking and other government regulators 
awbc cannot accurately predict the nature or extent of the effects on its business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies  or new federal or state laws  may have in the future 
changes in banking laws and regulations on november   the president signed into law the financial services modernization act of generally  the act i repeals the historical restrictions on preventing banks from affiliating with securities firms  ii provides a uniform framework for the activities of banks  savings institutions and their holding companies  iii broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks and banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies  iv provides an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumers information and v addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day to day operations and long term activities of financial institutions 
bank holding companies are permitted to engage in a wider variety of financial activities than permitted under previous law  particularly with respect to insurance and securities activities 
in addition  in a change from previous law  bank holding companies will be in a position to be owned  controlled or acquired by any company engaged in financially related activities  so long as such company meets certain regulatory 
table of contents americanwest bancorporation requirements 
the act also permits national banks and  in states with wildcard statutes  certain state banks  either directly or through operating subsidiaries  to engage in certain non banking financial activities 
awbc does not believe that the act will negatively affect the operations of it or its subsidiaries 
however  to the extent the legislation permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
this consolidation could result in a growing number of larger financial institutions that offer a wider variety of financial services than awbc currently offers and that can aggressively compete in the markets currently served by awbc and its subsidiary bank 
general 
as a bank holding company  awbc is subject to the bank holding company act of bhca  as amended  which places awbc under the supervision of the board of governors of the federal reserve frb 
awbc must file annual reports with the federal reserve and must provide it with such additional information as it may require 
in addition  the federal reserve periodically examines awbc and its subsidiary bank 
in general  the bhca limits bank holding company business to owning or controlling banks and engaging in other banking related activities 
bank holding companies must obtain the frb s approval before they acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank that results in total ownership or control  directly or indirectly  of more than of the voting shares of such bank  merge or consolidate with another bank holding company  or acquire substantially all of the assets of any additional banks 
subject to certain state laws  such as age and contingency laws  a bank holding company that is adequately capitalized and adequately managed may acquire the assets of both in state and out of state banks 
under the financial modernization act of  a bank holding company may apply to the frb to become a financial holding company  and thereby engage directly or through a subsidiary in certain activities deemed financial in nature  such as securities brokerage and insurance underwriting 
control of nonbanks 
with certain exceptions  the bhca prohibits bank holding companies from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares in any company that is not a bank or a bank holding company unless the frb determines that the activities of such company are incidental or closely related to the business of banking 
if a bank holding company is well capitalized and meets certain criteria specified by the frb  it may engage de novo in certain permissible nonbanking activities without prior frb approval 
control transactions 
the change in bank control act of  as amended  requires a person or group of persons acting in concert acquiring control of a bank holding company to provide the frb with days prior written notice of the proposed acquisition 
following receipt of this notice  the frb has days within which to issue a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition  but the frb may extend this time period for up to another days 
an acquisition may be completed before expiration of the disapproval period if the frb issues written notice of its intent not to disapprove the transaction 
in addition  any company must obtain the frb s approval before acquiring if the company is a bank holding company or more of the outstanding shares or otherwise obtaining control over awbc 
transactions with affiliates 
awbc and its subsidiary bank are deemed affiliates within the meaning of the federal reserve act  and transactions between affiliates are subject to certain restrictions 
accordingly  awbc and its subsidiary bank must comply with sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
generally  sections a and b limit the extent to which a financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with an affiliate  as defined  to an amount equal to of such institution s capital and surplus and an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital and surplus  and require all transactions with an affiliate  whether or not covered transactions  to be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary  as those provided to a non affiliate 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans  purchase of assets  issuance of a guarantee and other similar types of transactions 
regulation of management 
federal law sets forth the circumstances under which officers or directors of a financial institution may be removed by the institution s federal supervisory agency  places restraints 
table of contents americanwest bancorporation on lending by an institution to its executive officers  directors  principal stockholders  and their related interests  and prohibits management personnel from serving as a director or in other management positions with another financial institution which has assets exceeding a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area 
tie in arrangements 
awbc and its subsidiary bank cannot engage in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  neither awbc nor its subsidiary bank may condition an extension of credit on either a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by it or an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor 
the frb has adopted significant amendments to its anti tying rules that removed frb imposed anti tying restrictions on bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries  allow banks greater flexibility to package products with their affiliates  and establish a safe harbor from the tying restrictions for certain foreign transactions 
these amendments were designed to enhance competition in banking and nonbanking products and to allow banks and their affiliates to provide more efficient  lower cost service to their customers 
however  the impact of the amendments on awbc and its subsidiary bank is unclear at this time 
state law restrictions 
as a washington business corporation  awbc may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions as provided under applicable washington corporate law 
in addition  washington banking law may restrict certain activities of its subsidiary bank 
general 
the bank is subject to regulation by the state of washington and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the federal and state laws that apply to awbc s subsidiary bank regulate  among other things  the scope of its business  its investments  its reserves against deposits  the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for loans 
the laws and regulations governing its subsidiary bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and not to protect stockholders of the subsidiary bank or its holding company 
cra 
the community reinvestment act the cra requires that  in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction  regulators must evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions  and applications to open a branch or facility 
insider credit transactions 
banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders  or any related interests of such persons 
extensions of credit i must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees  and ii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons 
a violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer  director  employee  agent  or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank  the imposition of a cease and desist order  and other regulatory sanctions 
fdicia 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of the fdicia  each federal banking agency has prescribed  by regulation  noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
these standards cover internal controls  information systems  and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate  and standards for asset quality  earnings and stock valuation 
an institution  which fails to meet these standards  must develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject 
table of contents americanwest bancorporation the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management of awbc believes that its subsidiary bank meets all such standards  and therefore  does not believe that these regulatory standards materially affect awbc s business operations 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate act permits nationwide interstate banking and branching under certain circumstances 
this legislation generally authorizes interstate branching and relaxes federal law restrictions on interstate banking 
currently  bank holding companies may purchase banks in any state  and states may not prohibit such purchases 
additionally  banks are permitted to merge with banks in other states as long as the home state of neither merging bank has opted out 
the interstate act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low income area 
under recent fdic regulations  banks are prohibited from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production 
the fdic has accordingly implemented a loan to deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition 
with regard to interstate bank mergers  washington has opted in to the interstate act and allows in state banks to merge with out of state banks subject to certain aging requirements 
washington law generally authorizes the acquisition of an in state bank by an out of state bank through merger with a washington financial institution that has been in existence for at least years prior to the acquisition 
with regard to interstate bank branching  out of state banks that do not already operate a branch in washington may not establish de novo branches in washington or establish and operate a branch by acquiring a branch in washington 
deposit insurance 
the deposits of its subsidiary bank are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor through its subsidiary bank s insurance fund bif administered by the fdic 
all insured banks are required to pay semi annual deposit insurance premium assessments to the fdic 
the fdicia included provisions to reform the federal deposit insurance system  including the implementation of risk based deposit insurance premiums 
the fdicia also permits the fdic to make special assessments on insured depository institutions in amounts determined by the fdic to be necessary to give it adequate assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the us treasury and other sources  or for any other purpose the fdic deems necessary 
the fdic has implemented a risk based insurance premium system under which banks are assessed insurance premiums based on how much risk they present to the bif 
banks with higher levels of capital and a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital or a higher degree of supervisory concern 
dividends 
the principal source of awbc s cash revenues is dividends received from its subsidiary bank 
the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation  in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends  which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in addition  a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements 
capital adequacy 
federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  the holding company or bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or nonbank businesses or to open new facilities 
the fdic and federal reserve use risk based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies 
these are designed to make such capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage 
table of contents americanwest bancorporation of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines are minimums  and the federal reserve has noted that bank holding companies contemplating significant expansion programs should not allow expansion to diminish their capital ratios and should maintain ratios well in excess of the minimum 
the current guidelines require all bank holding companies and federally regulated banks to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio equal to  of which at least must be tier i capital 
tier i capital for bank holding companies includes common shareholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles except as described above 
the federal reserve also employs a leverage ratio  which is tier i capital as a percentage of total assets less intangibles  to be used as a supplement to risk based guidelines 
the principal objective of the leverage ratio is to constrain the maximum degree to which a bank holding company may leverage its equity capital base 
the federal reserve requires a minimum leverage ratio of 
however  for all but the most highly rated bank holding companies and for bank holding companies seeking to expand  the federal reserve expects an additional cushion of at least to 
fdicia created a statutory framework of supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of the individual institution 
under regulations adopted by the fdic  an institution is assigned to one of five capital categories depending on its total risk based capital ratio  tier i risk based capital ratio  and leverage ratio  together with certain subjective factors 
institutions which are deemed to be undercapitalized depending on the category to which they are assigned are subject to certain mandatory supervisory corrective actions 
awbc does not believe that these regulations have any material effect on its operations 
effects of government monetary policy 
the earnings and growth of awbc are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government  particularly the federal reserve 
the federal reserve can and does implement national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession  but its open market operations in us government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the federal reserve  and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits  influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on awbc and its subsidiary bank cannot be predicted with certainty 
disclosure controls and procedures the sarbanes oxley act of and related rulemaking by the securities and exchange commission sec  which effect sweeping corporate disclosure and financial reporting reform  generally require public companies to focus on their disclosure controls and procedures 
as a result  public companies such as americanwest bancorporation  now must have disclosure controls and procedures in place and make certain disclosures about them in their periodic sec reports ie  forms k and q and their chief executive and chief financial officers must certify in these filings that they are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and disclose their conclusions about the effectiveness of such controls and procedures based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by the relevant report  among other things 
awbc is monitoring the status of other related ongoing rulemaking by the sec and other regulatory entities 
currently  management believes that awbc is in compliance with the rulemaking promulgated to date 
customer information security the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted final guidelines for establishing standards for safeguarding nonpublic personal information about customers that implement provisions of the financial modernization act of the guidelines 
among other things  the guidelines require each financial institution  under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof  to develop  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information  and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 

table of contents americanwest bancorporation privacy the fdic and other regulatory agencies have published final privacy rules pursuant to provisions of the financial modernization act of privacy rules 
the privacy rules  which govern the treatment of nonpublic personal information about consumers by financial institutions  require a financial institution to provide notice to customers and other consumers in some circumstances about its privacy policies and practices  describe the conditions under which a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and provide a method for consumers to prevent a financial institution from disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated third parties by opting out of that disclosure  subject to certain exceptions 
usa patriot act the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of the usa patriot act  designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain anonymous access to the us financial system  has significant implications for depository institutions  broker dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money 
the usa patriot act  together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies  require financial institutions  including americanwest bank  to implement additional or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to  among other things  anti money laundering compliance  suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers 
they also permit information sharing for counter terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions  as well as among financial institutions  subject to certain conditions  and require the frb and other federal banking agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering applications filed under section of the bhca or the bank merger act 
management believes that awbc and its subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all currently effective requirements prescribed by the usa patriot act and all applicable final implementing regulations

table of contents americanwest bancorporation the loan portfolio 
awbc and its subsidiaries regularly evaluate the level of provision and the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by considering such factors as current loan grades  historical loss rates  change in the nature of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  industry concentrations  delinquency trends  current economic factors and estimate impact of current economic conditions that may effect a borrower s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provision for loan loss

income tax expense 
income tax expense increased in proportion to the increase in income before income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that awbc s cash flow will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future 
cash flows from operations contribute significantly to liquidity  as do proceeds from maturities of securities and increasing customer deposits 
if awbc needs additional liquidity  it would be required to borrow or issue additional capital stock 
awbc s ability to incur indebtedness is limited by government regulations and its ability to service borrowings is dependent upon the availability of dividends from the bank 
the payments of dividends by the bank are subject to limitations imposed by law and governmental regulations 
at the end of and  awb had balances of million  and million in certificates of deposit that were attained through the use of qwickrate express data and their internet services 
the bank may borrow on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds 
bank borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets 
at december   awbc had approximately million of lines of credit available for liquidity purposes 
cash flows from operations also contribute significantly to liquidity as indicated in awbc s consolidated statement of cash flows  as well as proceeds from maturities of securities and increasing customer deposits 
awbc s total stockholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december   and million at december  at december   stockholders equity was of total assets  compared to at december  at december   awbc held cash and cash equivalent assets of million 
the capital levels of awbc and the bank exceed applicable regulatory well capitalized guidelines at december  and december  effects of inflation and changing prices 
the primary impact of inflation on awbc s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general 
table of contents americanwest bancorporation levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary

it defined a vie as a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for the business purpose that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
this interpretation will require a vie to be consolidated or deconsolidated by a company generally based on the risk of loss or return 
most of the provisions of interpretation no 
have been delayed until march  the company has a vie in the form of a trust set up to issue trust preferred securities and accordingly  the implementation of the interpretation is expected to require the deconsolidation of the trust

it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity

this eitf consensus is effective for fiscal years ending after december  accordingly  the company has adopted this statement as of december  and the result did not have an impact on the company s statement of financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management considers interest rate risk to be a market risk that could have a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations of awbc 
awbc does not use derivatives including forward and futures contracts  options  and swaps to manage its market and interest rate risks 
all of awbc s transactions are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of awbc s loan portfolio has interest rates  which float with the bank s reference interest rates 
fixed rate loans are generally made with a term of five years or less 
general economic conditions  regulatory policy and competition in the marketplace affect interest income and cost of funds 
the bank s operating strategies focus on asset liability management 
the purpose of asset liability management alm is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the awbc s earnings from undue interest rate risk 
awbc follows an alm policy for managing exposure to interest rate risk 
the alm policy is designed to maintain an appropriate balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to maximize interest rate spreads 
awbc monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities with respect to changes in interest rates and maturities  and directs the allocation of their funds accordingly 
the strategy of awbc has been to maintain  to the extent possible  a balanced position between assets and liabilities  and to place emphasis on the sensitivity of its assets
