the investment was written down to million  which represented the value of the company s preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at october  the closing date of september s books

accordingly  the company concluded that sufficient risk existed that worldheart may be unable to fully liquidate the company s investment in worldheart s preferred stock 
the company believed that the best objective indicator of the then fair value of its investment in worldheart s preferred stock was the market price of worldheart s common stock based upon the company s expectation that the value of its preferred stock investment would be realized through the common stock  as opposed to redemption of the preferred stock 
based upon the non strategic nature and declining profitability of certain products in the company s portfolio including certain distributed products  the company decided during the quarter ended june  to discontinue its sales effort of these products 
the long lived assets and the investments related to these products were evaluated to determine whether any impairment in their recoverability existed at the determination date 
as a result  edwards lifesciences assessed whether the estimated cash flows of the products or investments over the estimated lives of the related assets were sufficient to recover their costs 
where such cash flows were insufficient  the company utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of assets or investments and recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values

the company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital  capital expenditures and other financial commitments 
the company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long term capital to fund short term and long term growth objectives 
however  no assurances can be given that such long term capital will be available to edwards lifesciences on favorable terms  or at all 
as of december   the company had two unsecured revolving credit agreements providing for up to an aggregate of million in one to six month borrowings in multiple currencies 
borrowings currently bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus  which includes a facility fee 
one of the credit agreements provides for long term borrowings up to an aggregate of million and expires on march  the five year credit facility 
the other credit agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of million through march  the day facility 
as the day facility has not been used recently  the company does not plan to renew this credit agreement when it expires 
as of december   borrowings of million were outstanding under the five year credit facility and no borrowings were outstanding under the day facility 
edwards lifesciences pays a facility fee  regardless of available or outstanding borrowings  currently at an annual rate of for the five year credit facility and for the day facility 
as of december   all amounts outstanding under the five year credit facility have been classified as long term obligations  as these borrowings will continue to be refinanced pursuant to that credit agreement 
in march  the company will reclassify any balance outstanding on the five year credit facility to short term as the agreement will expire within one year 
the credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants  all of which the company was in compliance with at december  in may  the company issued million of convertible senior debentures  issued at par  bearing an interest rate of per annum due may  the notes 
interest is payable semi annually in may and november 
issuance costs of approximately million are being amortized to interest expense over years 
the notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock for each  principal amount of notes conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes may be converted  at the option of the holders  on or prior to the final maturity date under any of the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter  if the closing sale price per share of the company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
holders of the notes have the right to require the company to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest on may    and the company will pay cash for all notes so purchased on may  for any notes purchased by the company on may  or  the company may  at its option  choose to pay the purchase price in cash  in shares of the company s common stock  or any combination thereof

this contingent interest payment feature represents an embedded derivative 
based on the immaterial value associated with this feature  no value has been assigned to the derivative at issuance or at december  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has two securitization programs whereby certain subsidiaries in the united states and japan sell  without recourse  on a continuous basis  an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of accounts receivable 
the significant benefits of the securitizations are lower cost of funds and differentiated sources of liquidity 
the company has been able to effectively lower its overall cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads it pays on these advances as opposed to borrowings under the current libor based credit facility 
additionally  the company believes that in diversifying its funding sources  the company s funding availability in the capital markets is strengthened 
as of december   the company had sold a total of million of trade accounts receivable and received funding of million

pvt s technology is a combination balloon expandable stent technology integrated with a percutaneously delivered tissue heart valve 
unlike conventional open heart valve replacement surgery  this less invasive procedure is designed to be performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory under local anesthesia 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the company s accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in evaluating the company s transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  any impairments of assets  anticipated transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  and collection is reasonably assured 
in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 
the company enters into certain arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements to its customers 
revenue related to an individual element is deferred unless delivery of the element represents a separate earnings process 
total revenue for these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the fair value of the individual elements  with the relative fair values determined based on objective evidence generally based on sales of the individual element to other third parties 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company adopted emerging issues task force as of january  and presents the cost of certain vendor considerations as reductions of revenue 
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products  an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable 
these adjustments include estimates for charge backs  rebates  returns  and other sales allowances 
these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions does not properly reflect future activity  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
the company s estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data  as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates  and reflect other limitations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
inventory reserves result from inventory  which is obsolete  is nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration  or is damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
patent costs the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications 
the company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable 
the related costs are amortized over the remaining useful lives of the patents using the straight line method 
such deferred costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 
to the extent the company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement  costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received 
impairment of long lived assets on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review 
as the company s operations are comprised of one reporting unit  the company reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the company s fair value to the net book value of its assets 
if the book value of the company s assets exceeds the company s fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
additionally  management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangibles whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method 
the fair values of certain investments are based on quoted market prices 
for other investments  various methods are used to estimate fair value  including external valuations and discounted cash flows 
when the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost  management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the reasons for the decline in market value  the investee s performance against product development milestones  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
income taxes the company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure 
new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments

to the extent the company s estimates differ from actual payments or assessments  income tax expense is adjusted

the company evaluates annually the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps  option based products and forward currency contracts 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional amounts of the company s derivative financial instruments at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements  option based products  and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and  are not a measure of the company s exposure through its use of derivatives 
interest rate risk the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis 
the company s interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate  at specified intervals  calculated on an agreed upon notional amount 
as part of its overall risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates 
a basis point increase in interest rates approximately percent of the company s weighted average interest rate affecting the company s financial instruments  including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments  would not change the company s annual interest expense  net because the company has no floating rate debt  after giving effect to interest rate swaps 
in january  the company borrowed million on its floating rate five year credit facility to fund its general operating activities and the acquisition of pvt 
currency risk the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts 
the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated  but not yet committed  sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates 
such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets 
any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs  the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
option based products consist primarily of purchased put options in conjunction with written sold call options to create collars 
option based products are agreements that either grant the company the right to receive  or require the company to make payments at  specified currency rate levels 
as part of its risk management process  the company uses a value at risk var methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation  with a percent confidence level  using spot and three month implied volatilities as stochastic variables and correlations as of the measurement date to estimate this potential loss 
the company s calculated var at december  and  with a maturity of up to one year  is million and million  respectively 
this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances 
the company s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur 
actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  and changes in the company s portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods 
in addition  the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse  which may not be the case 
any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures  there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future 
credit risk derivative financial instruments used by the company involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in the event a counter party should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations 
credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines  counter party diversification  monitoring of counter party financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counter parties 
credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at december  reduced by the effects of master netting agreements 
additionally  at december   all derivative financial instruments  based on notional amounts  were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of aa or better by national rating agencies 
the company does not anticipate non performance by its counter parties and has no reserves related to non performance as of december   the company has not experienced any counterparty default during the three years ended december  concentrations of credit risk in the normal course of business  edwards lifesciences provides credit to customers in the health care industry  performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses which  when realized  have been within the range of management s allowance for doubtful accounts during all periods presented

the company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies 
these investments are classified in investments in unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
in  the company recorded a million pretax charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of worldheart 
the investment was written down to million  which represented the value of the company s preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at october  the decision to record the charge was based primarily on delays in worldheart s product development timelines  arising from its revised strategy 
should worldheart fail to meet certain future development and financing milestones  further impairment charges may be necessary 
in addition to the investment in worldheart million at december   edwards lifesciences had approximately million of investments in equity instruments of other companies 
at december   the company had recorded unrealized gains of million and unrealized losses of million on these investments in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
management considers these declines temporary in nature based upon the individual companies operating results  financial condition and achievement of product development milestones 
should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones  the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary
