the new senior credit facility contains affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios  such as debt to earnings including amounts provided for depreciation and amortization  earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense  minimum net worth  maximum ancillary facilities indebtedness and the prohibition of off balance sheet funding 
we are also obligated to ensure that the guarantors of the new senior credit facility must not at any time represent less than of the consolidated gross assets  turnover or earnings before interest and taxes of the uk subsidiaries 
as of september   we were in compliance with such covenants 
critical accounting policies accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivables  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change 
intangible assets we have significant amounts of goodwill 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
we have recorded goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through september  goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
a more frequent evaluation will be performed if indicators of impairment are present 
we completed the annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill balance 
the calculation of fair value used for an impairment test includes a number of estimates and assumptions  including future income and cash flow projections  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
deferred income taxes we account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company  as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net loss and operating loss carry forwards 
contingencies related to our acquisitions of certain flexible staffing agencies  we have entered into agreements to pay additional amounts  in cash  in the form of contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of such acquired entities 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  also  we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
revenue recognition patient services and respiratory therapy revenues are recognized when services are performed and substantiated by proper documentation 
for patient services  which are billed at fixed rates and account for over of our company s business  revenue is recognized upon completion of timesheets that also require the signature of the recipient of services 
revenues from the rental of home medical equipment including respiratory equipment are recognized over the rental period typically on a month to month basis 
revenues from the sale of oxygen and supplies for use in respiratory therapy are recognized when products are shipped  a contractual arrangement exists  the sales price is either fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we receive a majority of our revenue from the nhs and other uk governmental payors 
certain revenues are subject to review by third party payors and adjustments  if any  are recorded when determined 
purchase accounting we account for our acquisitions as purchase business combinations 
at acquisition  preliminary values and useful lives are allocated based upon fair values that have been determined for assets acquired and liabilities assumed and management s best estimates for values that have not yet been finalized 
we obtain a third party valuation in order to complete our purchase price allocations 
accordingly  final asset and liability fair values as well as useful lives may differ from management s original estimates and could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
results of operations year ended september  vs 
year ended september  revenues total revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of million or 
this increase was mainly due to the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange million  acquisitions in the social service sector million and internal growth in the social service sector and in our respiratory  medical equipment and supplies operations 
this increase was offset by a decrease in revenues due to changes to nhs quality standards  causing fewer of our workers to be available for placement with the nhs while the necessary training certificates  immunizations and criminal record checks required by these standards were obtained  and the expansion of the nhs professionals to encompass more healthcare workers 
there can be no assurance that the continued expansion of the nhs professionals may not adversely affect our revenues in future periods 
gross profit total gross profit increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   an increase of 
the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange accounted for million of the increase 
as a percentage of total revenue  gross profit for the year ended september  increased to from for the comparable prior period 
gross margins for patient services increased for the year ended september  versus for the comparable prior period mainly due to management s focus on supplying healthcare staff to our higher margin customers 
gross margins in respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales increased for the year ended september  versus for the comparable prior period mainly due to an increased focus on sales of portable oxygen therapy equipment and a steady increase in the number of patients in northern ireland  while keeping costs static 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   an increase of 
changes in foreign exchange accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining increase was mainly a result of higher levels of overhead costs due principally to increased expenditures on quality assurance audit programs to ensure compliance with changes to legislation million  acquisitions million  compensation charges for key executives to complete the reimbursement of tax liabilities and to resolve other consequences incurred by them in connection with the fiscal reorganization as well as a special compensation charge million and fees associated with migrating the trading of our shares of common stock from the american stock exchange to the nasdaq national market million 
we do not anticipate incurring further compensation expense related to the reorganization 
interest income total interest income for the year ended september  was million compared to million for the year ended september   which represents a decrease of million 
the decrease was attributable to a lower level of funds invested and was partially offset by favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange million 
interest expense total interest expense for the year ended september  was million compared to million for the year ended september   which represents an increase of million 
this increase was principally attributable to the write off of million of deferred financing fees and unamortized debt discount associated with the refinancing of the senior credit facility and million related to changes in foreign exchange 
this increase was partially offset by reduced bank debt in the fiscal year ended september   the recording of a million benefit related to the change in the fair value of our company s interest rate cap and floor collar agreement in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to a million benefit recorded in the fiscal year ended september   and the write off of debt discount of million associated with the repayment of loan notes in the year ended september  provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to million or of income before income taxes for the year ended september   compared to a provision of million or of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended september  included in the tax provision for the year ended september  is a benefit related to the reversal of an estimated income tax liability million for a business that was previously discontinued and no longer has any tax liabilities 
excluding this benefit  the provision for income taxes would have been million or of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended september  the difference in the effective tax rate from the year ended september  to the year ended september  is mainly due to the ratio of us pre tax losses to consolidated pre tax income as our company does not provide a tax benefit for us pre tax losses as it is more likely than not that we will not utilize our net operating losses in the us and permanent differences in the uk discontinued operations and gain on sale of subsidiaries discontinued operations resulted in income of million for the year ended september  on april   we sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two of our subsidiaries for approximately million in cash 
home healthcare  which comprised our us operations  was concentrated in new york and new jersey  and supplied infusion therapy  respiratory therapy and home medical equipment 
in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our company has accounted for home healthcare as a discontinued operation
