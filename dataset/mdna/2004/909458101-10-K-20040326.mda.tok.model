when interest accruals are discontinued  all interest income accrued is reversed 
while loans which are past due days or more as to interest or principal payments are considered for non accrual status  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of collateral  in management s judgment  is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued interest

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the only significant market risk to which the corporation is exposed is interest rate risk 
the business of the corporation and the composition of its balance sheet consist of investments in interest earning assets primarily loans and securities  which are funded by interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
these financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in the market rates of interest  resulting in market risk 
none of the corporation s financial instruments are held for trading purposes 
the corporation manages interest rate risk regularly through its asset liability committee 
the committee meets on a regular basis and reviews various asset and liability management information  including but not limited to  the bank s liquidity positions  projected sources and uses of funds  interest rate risk positions and economic conditions 
the corporation monitors its interest rate risk through a sensitivity analysis  whereby it measures potential changes in its future earnings and the fair values of its financial instruments that may result from one or more hypothetical changes in interest rates  this analysis is performed by estimating the expected cash flows of the corporation s financial instruments using interest rates in effect at year end 
for the fair value estimates  the cash flows are then discounted to year end to arrive at an estimated present value of the corporation s financial instruments 
hypothetical changes in interest rates are then applied to the financial instruments  and the cash flows and fair values are again estimated using these hypothetical rates 
for the net interest income estimates  the hypothetical rates are applied to the financial instruments based on the assumed cash flows 
the corporat ion applies these interest rate shocks to its financial instruments up and down basis points in basis point increments 
the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income percentage change in net income given a linear bp increase in the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated that net interest income for the corporation would decrease by and net income would increase by 
a bp decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by and decrease net income by 
management does not expect any significant adverse effect to net interest income in based on the composition of the portfolio and anticipated trends in rates
