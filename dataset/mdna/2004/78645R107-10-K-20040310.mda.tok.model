overview we develop  market  sell and support a portfolio of hardware and software network security products and services 
our products and services are used to create secure wide area networks wans and virtual private networks over the internet vpns to prevent security breaches that could result in unauthorized access to confidential data  invasion of privacy and financial loss 
we have two reportable business segments 
through our enterprise security division  we sell high performance security solutions to address the needs of our government  financial institution and other security sensitive commercial customers 
we also provide  through our embedded security division  a broad range of network security products  including silicon chips  accelerator cards  licensed intellectual property and software products  to oems that embed them in their own network infrastructure and wireless products 
these divisions are managed separately because they offer different products and employ different marketing strategies see note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review and consider possible acquisitions of companies that we believe will contribute to our long term objectives and discuss such acquisitions with the management of those companies 
such acquisitions  which may be material  may be made from time to time 
in january  we acquired pijnenburg securealink  inc  a delaware corporation primarily engaged in the manufacture of security chips for e commerce transactions through its european subsidiary 
securealink develops  markets and sells security chips and intellectual property  primarily in europe and asia 
as a result of the acquisition  we broadened our market with the addition of new technologies and a larger presence in europe 
we integrated the operations of securealink into our embedded security division 
in february  our management decided to discontinue our swiss subsidiary operations at gretacoder data systems gds  which was formerly our european operations segment see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the decision to discontinue gds s operations was based on the amount of its operating and cash losses during and  as well as a significant downturn in its future business prospects 
we transferred certain employees from gds s sales and marketing group to our sales group to create a european sales office focused on selling our enterprise products and services in europe 
the operating results of the discontinued businesses has been reported in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statements of operations 
in february  we acquired cylink corporation  which expanded our customer base and our product offerings to include security solutions for wans 
operations of cylink were integrated into the enterprise security division 
in february  we also acquired the assets of raqia networks  inc  a development stage company that was developing content inspection technology 
this transaction consisted primarily of technology related intangible assets 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets and properties used in connection with the toolkit  ipvia vpn and vpn client businesses of ssh communications security corp 
ssh for approximately million in cash 
ssh is a world leading supplier of managed security middleware 
in october  we entered into an agreement to acquire rainbow technologies  inc  a provider of information security solutions for mission critical data and applications used in business  organization and government computing environments  in a stock for stock transaction 
consummation of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including the approval of rainbow s stockholders and our stockholders 
under the terms of the agreement  each outstanding share of rainbow common stock will be exchanged for of a share of safenet common stock 
all outstanding options to acquire rainbow common stock will be assumed by us and converted into options to purchase shares of our common stock using the same exchange ratio 
if the merger is consummated  the company will issue in the transaction approximately million shares of safenet common stock on a fully diluted basis  which would represent approximately of the outstanding stock of the combined company as of october   the date the proposed merger was announced 
the company has subsequently announced a special shareholder meeting to be held on march  to approve the issuance of the shares of safenet common stock pursuant to the merger 
if this merger with rainbow is consummated  it will have a significant impact on our operations going forward 
while the impact of the proposed merger on our future results of operations and liquidity is uncertain at this time  the combined company is expected to add  new customers to safenet s existing customer base  distribution channels in over countries  and up to employees to safenet s approximately employees 
we expect that revenues of the combined company will be significantly greater than our revenues 
pro forma revenues for the combined company as of december  are million compared to our revenues for the same period of million 
we expect that the gross margins for the combined company will be lower than our current gross margins as a result of rainbow having a significant portion of its revenues under long term contracts  which is accounted for using the percentage of completion method  as well as  the effect of amortization of acquired intangibles 
this has the effect of including all significant costs  including allowable sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative costs related to its long term contracts in costs of sales instead of operating expenses 
the pro forma results of operations of the combined company for the year ended december  result in gross margins of as compared to safenet s stand alone gross margins of for the same period 
we expect our net loss to increase significantly as our reporting reflects the acquisition related charges  including amortization of acquired intangibles 
in addition  we anticipate the proposed merger will result in cost savings as a result of cost synergies and operating efficiencies after the integration of our businesses 
while the magnitude and timing of those benefits is uncertain  we currently anticipate pre tax annual cost savings of at least million to million  including anticipated savings of million to million in professional fees and insurance costs  million to million in marketing costs  and million to million in management and board of directors expenses 
for a description of the proposed merger with rainbow  including the risks associated with the merger  please refer to our registration statement on form s  which is on file with the securities and exchange commission and available through the sec s website at www

our historical operating results have been dependent on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the length of the sales cycle  the timing of orders from and shipments to clients  product development expenses and the timing of development and introduction of new products 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
the size and timing of our historical revenues have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year 
accordingly  the results of a particular period  or period to period comparisons of recorded sales and profits may not be indicative of future operating results 
results of operations of safenet the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data of safenet as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december revenues cost of revenues gross profit research and development expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses costs of integration of acquired companies write off of in process research and development amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating loss investment income and other expenses  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense loss from continuing operations the company has two reportable segments products  chips and software designed and manufactured for sale to companies that will embed the company s products into their products for ultimate sale to end users embedded security division  and network security products designed and manufactured for direct sales to end users and remote access software sold to oem s enterprise security division 
the segments are strategic business units that offer different products 
the segments are managed separately because each segment requires different technology and marketing strategies see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
the proposed merger with rainbow technologies  which is expected to close in march  is expected to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
since the transaction is scheduled to close subsequent to december   this merger has not been considered in the company s discussion of its results of operations and financial condition as of and for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues and gross margins variance revenues by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenues by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total revenue mix by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenue mix by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total gross margins by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total gross margins by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total includes amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the increase in licenses and royalties from to was primarily related to three items 
the largest item was the execution of six new license arrangements that accounted for million in revenue 
there were also million of new intellectual property licenses during finally  our development revenue related to our long term government contracts increased approximately million from to product revenues increased from to due to the acquisition of cylink and its wide area network wan product line 
the product revenue for that came from cylink based products was approximately million 
additional revenue came from sales of new products introduced in totaling approximately million 
this additional revenue was offset by a decrease in legacy product sales of approximately million 
the remaining decrease in product revenue was related to the embedded security division s loss of a significant contract with cisco systems early in that led to a million reduction in revenues 
the increase in service and maintenance revenue from to is due to two acquisitions 
the first was the acquisition of cylink in february  adding approximately million of service and maintenance revenue in the second was the acquisition of the oem product line of ssh  inc ssh in november in the period of safenet ownership  the maintenance contracts acquired in the ssh transaction accounted for million of incremental revenue 
revenues from to for the embedded security division increased slightly as increased license and royalty revenue  including intellectual property licenses  offset the loss of product revenue from the loss of a significant contract with cisco systems early in the enterprise security division significantly increased revenues from to through the acquisition of cylink and its product lines and related maintenance contracts as well as securing two significant license arrangements totaling million 
gross margins increased slightly   from to the most significant reason for this was the increase in license and royalty revenue  in dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
in  the significant licenses and intellectual property sales were software and technology based  which offer a higher percentage of gross margins in terms of dollars than safenet s recurring royalty revenue stream or development revenues from its long term government contracts 
these higher gross margins were also offset by decreasing product margins resulting from higher component costs for the wide area network products compared to safenet s legacy products 
due to several factors competition  an unsteady economy  and pricing sensitivity of high end products such as safenet s wan products  safenet chose not to pass those increased costs through to our customers 
safenet believes that the product margin of is reflective of its actual product margin for the company s current product offerings 
operating expenses variance operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development costs amortization of intangible assets cost of integration of acquired companies total the increase in research and development expenses from to was due to several factors 
headcount increased as a result of the cylink acquisition and the raqia acquisition  both in february  as well as the ssh acquisition in late several new products and technology offerings were introduced  including two new chip designs within the embedded security division and the highassurance product line with safenet s security management center from the enterprise security division 
safenet also continued development related to our long term government contracts 
safenet also expended significant efforts in  that will continue through  on entering and subsequently expanding safenet s technology and product offerings into the wireless communication market 
sales and marketing expenses increased from to  primarily as a function of revenues 
sales and marketing expenses remained constant as a percentage of sales  in and the dollar increases from to are a function of increased headcount in the sales and product marketing departments as safenet continues to introduce new products and expand its presence and awareness within the government  financial institution and original equipment manufacturers sectors 
safenet also invested significant sales and marketing resources into its new and expanding presence in the wireless communications markets 
safenet will continue to market itself into emerging markets  like wireless communications  as the need for secured communications continues to expand 
safenet also intends to expand its market presence in emea europe  middle east  and asia as well as apac asia pacific and the americas 
general and administrative expenses increased from to as the result of increased headcount 
safenet s management and support infrastructure increased by new employees in from in to in 
there were additional expenses specific to related to the adoption of the corporate governance requirements instituted for public companies by the sarbanes oxley act 
safenet will experience additional increases in these costs for as more requirements are instituted 
safenet believes  as a percentage of sales  that of revenues for  is a reliable measure of cost management 
the write off of acquired in process research and development costs for was directly attributable to the acquisition of the raqia assets million and the acquisition of cylink million 
these write offs represent the estimated fair value of the in process research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility at the acquisition dates  and had no alternate future use 
the values assigned to these acquired in process technologies relate entirely to three distinct projects a specific content inspection chip and compiler raqia  a specific gateway design for security applications that included specific government certifications cylink  and a fully integrated policy and security manager for multiple platforms and networks that use safenet technology cylink 
the estimated fair values of these projects were determined by the use of discounted cash flow models  using discount rates that took into account the stage of completion  and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the technology and product 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we incurred approximately million in additional research and development charges to complete the development of these technologies 
completion of the development of these technologies occurred during the first quarter of  reaching both technological feasibility and general availability 
for  the write off of in process research and development costs amounted to million  all of which related to the acquisition of securealink  which was for the in process research and development of a new application specific integrated circuit that was completed and licensed to a customer in safenet incurred an additional million of costs to complete this project during the amortization of acquired intangible assets for related to the acquisitions of cylink and the raqia assets  as well as securealink 
we acquired intangible assets  including developed technology  patents  customer relationships contracts  backlog  and non compete agreements 
the amortization of developed technology and backlog is included in costs of revenues and the remainder is included in amortization of intangible assets 
the cylink intangible assets total million and are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of years 
the raqia intangible assets total million and are being amortized over three years 
the securealink intangible assets total million and are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years 
for  the amortization of intangible assets related only to the acquisition of securealink and the appropriate intangible assets 
costs of integration of acquired companies are costs specifically incurred as a result of integrating the people  products  and technology of cylink  the raqia and ssh assets  as well as some preliminary costs for the pending merger with rainbow technologies 
the integrations of cylink and raqia were substantially completed during the second quarter of the integration of ssh assets and people was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of these costs are primarily employee transition costs and professional fees 
we will incur additional integration expenses in connection with these acquisitions  especially the rainbow technologies merger see liquidity and resources for further discussion related to the rainbow technologies merger 
interest and other income  net variance interest and other income  net the increase from to is attributable to higher cash balances in generating increased interest income of million 
in  safenet  through its dutch subsidiary  received a grant from the dutch government for developing technology in the netherlands of million 
there was no such grant in income tax expense benefit variance income tax expense benefit the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  is approximately 
this overall rate reflects the recognition of a tax benefit related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities established in purchase accounting for non deductible intangible assets  offset by the usage of us net operating loss carryforwards nols and current year deductions related to the exercise of non qualified stock options and the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options for which the tax benefit is recorded as a direct increase to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of income tax expense 
during  we incurred operating losses for which we recorded a full valuation allowance  as we could not predict the ultimate realization of the related deferred tax asset 
we believe the issuance of shares in the public offering we completed on july   when combined with the issuance of shares in connection with acquisitions in and  may have resulted in a change in control for purposes of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which would limit our ability to utilize a portion of these nols 
while we do not believe this limitation on the use of these nols would have a significant impact on our business  we are not able to quantify the amount of the limitation at this time 
loss from discontinued operations gds variance loss from discontinued operations the loss for resulted from our decision to discontinue operations at gretacoder data systems gds  which was formerly our european operations segment  in the first quarter of the discontinuation of operations was completed in may there are no costs associated with this activity in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues and gross margins variance revenues by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenues by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total revenue mix by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenue mix by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total gross margins by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total gross margins by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total revenues increased  or million  to million for the period ended december   from million in the embedded security division revenues increased or million due to the full year presence of the securealink acquisition for  which resulted in increased revenues of approximately million  as well as increased revenue from our largest commercial customer  cisco systems  inc cisco accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  the enterprise security division segment increased or million due primarily to revenues of approximately million earned under additional long term government contracts 
these contracts are the result of the government s approach to internet and communication security in light of the homeland security initiative 
gross margin remained consistent  for the period ended december   from in gross margins in the embedded security division decreased to in from in  due to the change in product mix with the addition of securealink delivering lower margin products 
enterprise security division margins increased to in from in based on increased customer base purchasing higher margin products as well changes in product mix with higher volumes in higher margin products such as license revenue 
operating expenses variance operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development costs costs of integration of acquired companies amortization of acquired intangible assets total research and development expenses increased  or million to million for the period ended december   from million in the increase is primarily related to the addition of the securealink business  with the main cost of that business being research and development costs 
research and development expenses for the embedded security division were focused on the next generation products chips  designed to be a very cost effective  high throughput  low power consuming chips in the tradition of safenet s other silicon products 
research and development expenses for the enterprise security division were focused on safenet s high assurance product line  including gateways  software  and other appliances 
some of these products were made available in with the remaining products coming to market in sales and marketing expenses increased  or million to million for the period ended december   from million in the additional expense reflects increased headcount  higher commissions from higher revenues  as well as additional promotional dollars spent on the branding of the securealink products and name 
as a percentage of revenues  the expenses were and in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the period ended december   from million in the increase is due to the additional office space obtained with the securealink acquisition  additional corporate employees  increased bonus expenses and additional professional fees incurred related to new corporate governance requirements 
as a percentage of revenues  the expenses were and in and  respectively 
the write off of acquired in process research and development assets  which totaled million for the year ended december   relates to the january acquisition of securealink 
this represents the estimated fair value of the in process research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility at the acquisition date  and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed at the acquisition date 
the value assigned to the acquired in process technology relates entirely to the development of a new application specific integrated circuit 
the estimated fair value of this project was determined by the use of a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate that took into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the technology 
subsequent to the acquisition  the company incurred approximately million in additional research and development charges to complete the development of the technology  which was licensed to a customer during fiscal year amortization of intangible assets  which totaled million for the year ended december   also relates to the january acquisition of securealink 
intangible assets  which consist primarily of developed technology and patents  are amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years 
interest and other income  net variance interest and other income  net interest and other income decreased by million  to million for the year ended december   from million in interest and other income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates throughout as compared to income tax expense benefit variance income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   the company incurred operating losses  however  the company also experienced an income tax benefit related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the securealink acquisition 
for the year ended december   the company incurred operating losses and therefore  did not record income tax expense 
the company s income tax benefit related to these losses has been offset by a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets since the company s ability to use the remaining net operating loss carryforward is dependent upon future taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   safenet had working capital of million including unrestricted cash and short term investments of million and restricted cash of million 
on july   we completed a secondary public offering pursuant to which we sold million shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of million 
safenet believes that its current cash resources and future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated short term and long term needs 
for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  cash provided by operating activities increased by million 
cash used in investing activities increased million  primarily due an increase in net purchases of investment securities of million and cash paid for the acquisition of the oem assets of ssh  inc million 
cash provided by financing activities increased million  which is mainly attributed to cash proceeds from our july secondary offering of million and an increase in cash received from stock option exercises of million 
material recurring uses of working capital include salaries and other compensation  which accounted for approximately million in  sales and marketing expenses  which accounted for approximately million in  and research and development projects  which accounted for approximately million in we have expended  and will continue to expend  significant amounts of cash for acquisition and integration costs related to prior and future acquisitions 
during  we completed the integrations of cylink  raqia  and ssh 
during  we also spent million for integration costs for the pending rainbow technology merger 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement related to the proposed merger with rainbow technologies  we may be obligated to pay rainbow technologies a termination fee of million if the merger agreement is terminated because our board of directors fails to support the merger in certain ways or in other specified circumstances following the public announcement of a competing acquisition proposal involving safenet 
we expect to incur costs associated with the merger which may aggregate million related to professional fees such as legal  due diligence  professional integration advisory services and financial advisory fees 
additionally  we would expect that there may be additional cash obligations  including obligations related to possible severance  directors and officers liability insurance for rainbow million  and lease buy outs 
at this point  we are unable to quantify the expected range  with the exception of the directors and officers liability insurance 
the following table sets forth  as of december   our commitments and contractual obligations for the years indicated amounts in thousands less than more than total one year years years years operating leases sales and marketing agreement purchase commitments total the operating leases are for the multiple facilities that we lease for our operations  sales and headquarters 
this agreement requires certain payments to be made in the future to complete our acquisition of these exclusive sales and marketing rights 
safenet generally does not make unconditional  non cancelable purchase commitments 
safenet enters into purchase orders in the normal course of business which are less than one year in term 
inflation and seasonality safenet does not believe that inflation will significantly impact its business 
we do not believe our business is seasonal 
however  because we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment and software revenues upon establishing fair value of undelivered elements  recognition may be irregular and uneven  thereby disparately impacting quarterly operating results and balance sheet comparisons 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in this note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
safenet believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
safenet senior management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies with the company s audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts safenet maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
we calculate the allowance based on a specific analysis of past due balances and also consider historical trends of write offs 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory safenet provides for its estimated inventory obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company utilizes projected sales by product to determine the net realizable value of the inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
software development costs safenet calculates amortization of its capitalized software development costs based on the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
in addition  safenet assesses the recoverability of software development costs by comparing the unamortized balance to the net realizable value of the asset and writes off the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value 
these calculations require management to make assumptions about future demand for its products  future revenues to be generated from the sale of its products  as well as the estimated useful lives of developed technology 
if actual market conditions or product demand is different from those assumptions  or if changes in technology limit the useful life of safenet s core technology  additional amortization or write downs may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets safenet accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase price for each of these businesses is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the dates of acquisitions 
any excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill 
the identified intangible assets include patents  developed technology  purchase orders  contract backlog and acquired in process research and development assets 
research and development assets are written off at the date of acquisition in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the fair values were determined by management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations prepared by independent valuation experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using risk adjusted discount rates 
for certain classes of intangible assets  the valuations have been based upon estimated cost of replacement 
the assigned useful lives  which range from one to five years  are based upon periods of estimated cash flows and other factors 
if safenet used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of identified intangible assets and the estimation of the related useful lives  the amounts allocated to these assets  as well as the related amortization expense  would have been significantly different than the amounts recorded 
effective january   safenet adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under statement  goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value using the impairment testing methodology in statement indicators of potential impairment include operating losses  loss of a significant customer and adverse industry developments 
impairment testing for goodwill is conducted annually 
our most recent test was conducted as of october  the impairment test was based upon a comparison of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  the embedded security division and the enterprise security division  to the sums of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities allocated to each reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation were estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the reporting units 
in order to project future cash flows  management made a number of assumptions concerning such things as future sales volume levels  future price levels  and rates of increase in operating expenses 
since the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their recorded net assets  no impairment was identified or recorded 
however  if safenet used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of the reporting units  an impairment of goodwill may have been identified 
revenue recognition safenet derives revenue from software and technology licenses  product sales  maintenance and other services 
software and technology licenses contain multiple elements  including the product license  maintenance and or other services 
the recognition of revenue under these arrangements requires management to make judgments about the likelihood of granting future concessions and the ultimate collectibility of fees 
revenues that are earned under long term contracts to develop high assurance encryption technology are recognized using contract accounting 
under contract accounting  revenue from these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
progress to completion is measured using contract milestones 
accounting for these contracts requires the estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each milestone and each contract 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of financial instruments 
safenet is exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
safenet currently does not have any derivative financial instruments to protect against adverse currency movements 
safenet manages its exposure to market risks related to operations through regular operating and financing activities 
all of the potential impacts noted below are based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  actual results may differ materially 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  principally related to the euro and the british pound 
such fluctuations impact the recorded values of our investments in foreign subsidiaries in our consolidated balance sheet  and our currency translation adjustment  a component of other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   a change in average exchange rates for the euro and british pound would have changed our reported currency translation adjustment of million by approximately million 
the company s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk is not significant  and therefore a fluctuation in exchange rates would have a negligible impact on earnings 
interest rate risk we are exposed to investment risk to the extent we purchase short term interest bearing investment securities  which are considered cash equivalents and short term investments 
for the year ended december   we had net interest income of approximately million 
a change in the average interest rate for the year ended december  would have had a negligible effect on earnings 
at december  and  safenet did not have any interest bearing obligations 
in addition  safenet does not hold any derivative instruments and does not have any commodity market risk
