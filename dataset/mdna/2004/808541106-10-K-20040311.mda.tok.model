pension accounting estimates the company recognizes the estimated compensation cost of employees pension benefits over their approximate period of service to the company in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the company s earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to pension benefits  which primarily consist of us and french pension benefits 
each year s recorded expense is an estimate based on actuarial calculations of the company s accumulated and projected benefit obligations for its various plans 
these actuarial calculations utilize several key actuarial assumptions which require management judgement  the most significant of which are the discount rate  used to determine the present value of estimated future retirement benefit payments  and the long term rate of return on plan assets  which is the expected average rate of return on plan assets which are expected to pay future benefits 
the company believes that its selections for these key actuarial assumptions are reasonable estimates for its plans and experience 
the company s us employee pension plans accounted for approximately percent and percent of the company s total pension plan assets and total accumulated benefit obligation  respectively  as of december  the discount rates used for the company s determination of projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations for its us employee pension plans were percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate fluctuates from year to year based on current market interest rates for high quality fixed income investments 
the company also evaluates the expected average duration of its pension obligations in determining its discount rate 
a change in the discount rate assumption of percent would change the company s estimated us pension expense by approximately million 
the company s assumed annual long term rate of return on plan assets for its us employee pension plan was percent for and was lowered to percent for  reflecting lower expected returns on plan assets 
the assumed long term rate of return is determined by evaluating historical and projected returns for benchmark equity and fixed income market indices as well as the projected investment mix of the company s pension assets 
the company changed its target us pension asset investment mix during and increased its expected return on plan assets to percent for the company utilized a monte carlo simulation analysis on the target us pension asset investment mix to determine its expected return on plan assets for the current asset allocation policy of the company s us employee pension plan targets an allocation of percent in equity securities  percent in fixed income securities and percent in other investments 
a change in the long term rate of return assumption of percent would change the company s estimated us pension expense by approximately million 
despite the company s belief that its estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results will likely differ from the company s estimates  and these differences could materially affect the company s future financial statements either favorably or unfavorably 
additionally  it is possible that assets of the company s plans could decline as a result of negative investment returns  which combined with increasing amounts of accumulated benefit obligations  could result in the company being required to make significant cash contributions to its plans in future periods 
for additional information regarding pension plan assets  benefit obligations and accounting assumptions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax valuation allowances the company records and maintains income tax valuation allowances as necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount which is estimated more likely than not to be realizable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the company has available net operating loss carryforwards  excess foreign tax credit carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and other various tax credits in the jurisdictions in which it operates  for which the company has recorded gross assets totaling million as of december  certain of these potential future benefits are not expected to be utilized in a manner beneficial to the company s financial results prior to their expiration 
as a result  the company has valuation allowances against certain of the above mentioned assets which totaled million as of december   reducing the related net deferred tax asset to million  an amount which is estimated to be realizable 
while the company believes it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize this amount of estimated net deferred income tax benefits  it is possible that the facts and circumstances on which the company s estimates and judgements are based could change  which could result in additional income tax expense in the future to increase the associated valuation allowances 
however  the company continues to evaluate possible methods to favorably utilize those assets that are reserved and  therefore  it is also possible that changes in the facts and circumstances on which the company s estimates and judgements are based could benefit the company in the future by some of the million of deferred tax assets reserved as of december  for additional information regarding income taxes and valuation allowances  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment valuation paper manufacturing  which is the company s primary manufacturing process  is a mature and capital intensive process 
as a result  the company makes substantial investments in property  plant and equipment which are recorded at cost 
the cost of depreciable property  plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes over the depreciable lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on the company s estimates of the useful lives of the assets  that is the period over which the company expects to benefit from the use of the asset 
paper machines and related equipment are not readily obsoleted and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years 
banded cigarette paper production assets in the united states are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years  although that product has not yet been widely commercialized 
the company periodically assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of long lived assets based on its expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related operations 
these factors  along with management s plans with respect to the operations  are considered in assessing the recoverability of property  plant and equipment 
facts and circumstances upon which management s estimates and plans are based could change  thus the possibility exists of a material adjustment to the company s financial statements in the future 
icms litigation the company evaluates contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  when a material loss contingency exists  the company accrues an estimated loss when the likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if no accrual is made for a material loss contingency because both of the above conditions are not met  or if an exposure to loss exists materially in excess of an accrual that is made  disclosure regarding the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 
as described in detail under litigation in part i  item  legal proceedings  swm b received assessments from the taxing authorities of the state of rio de janeiro  brazil related to icms taxes 
as of december   the assessment totaled approximately million  of which approximately million is covered by an indemnification agreement with the former owner of the predecessor of swm b  for a net exposure to the company of approximately million 
in  the courts granted swm b relief from having to bond the potential tax liability while it challenges the assessment 
in august and november  the court hearing the challenges in the state of rio de janeiro ruled in swm b s favor in its suits to vacate the assessment  affirming the bases of swm b s legal challenges of the assessment  and ruled that the government should pay the company s legal and court fees in the cases 
while the favorable decisions by the court with respect to the assessment provide further support for swm b s positions  these decisions will be automatically appealed  as provided for under brazilian legislation for cases involving an adverse financial outcome for the government in lower courts 
swm b continues to vigorously contest the assessment and believes the final resolution of this matter may still entail judicial proceedings up to and including presentation of the matter to the supreme court of brazil and is not likely to be finally resolved for several years 
the company s current evaluation of the matter is that swm b is more likely than not to prevail in its challenge of the assessment under the facts and law as presently understood and no reserve has been provided for this contingent liability 
however  there is a reasonable possibility that swm b will ultimately be required to pay all or a portion of this contingent liability  which could adversely impact the company s future financial results or financial condition 
in february  swm b filed suit against the state of rio de janeiro to recover icms credits previously reversed in following receipt of the assessment 
after the assessment was filed against the company  swm b changed its procedures and did not utilize icms tax credits through the end of production and sale of immune papers during as a result of the developments mentioned above with respect to the assessment  swm b has petitioned the court for permission to offset approximately million of overpaid icms taxes against current tax liabilities 
although swm b believes it has a reasonable chance of success in this case  no asset has been recorded for this potential recovery 
summary while a material impact to its future financial results or financial condition related to one or more of the above matters is possible  the company does not currently believe it is likely 
the company continually updates and assesses the facts and circumstances regarding these critical accounting matters and other significant accounting matters affecting estimates in its financial statements 
in addition to these accounting matters  other factors may affect the company s results  as described below 
factors that may affect future results many factors outside the control of the company could impact the company s results 
while not an exhaustive list  the following important factors could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
international business risks in addition to its us operations  the company has manufacturing facilities in france  brazil and canada 
the company  principally through its french and brazilian subsidiaries  markets and sells products in over countries  many of which are third world markets which are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political and economic conditions  expropriation  import and export tariffs  controls and restrictions  monetary exchange controls  inflationary economies  changes in currency value  changes in business and income tax regulations and risks related to restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
tax and repatriation matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various business and income tax laws in each of the countries in which it does business through wholly owned subsidiaries and through affiliates 
although the company believes it complies with the many business and income tax requirements of each of its operations  the company is exposed to the possibility of changes in enacted laws and interpretations of laws which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
also  the company evaluates its overall financing plans in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and manages international movements of cash from and amongst its foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner  however  an unanticipated international movement of funds due to unexpected changes in the company s business or in needs of the business could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
market risk as a multinational entity  the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company utilizes a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including operating and financing activities and  where considered appropriate  utilizing derivative instruments 
the company uses derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and not for trading or speculation 
all derivative instruments used by the company are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties 
foreign currency risk the company has subsidiaries located in france  brazil  canada and spain 
the company  together with its subsidiaries  conducts business in over countries worldwide transacting some of its business in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on the company s operating profit 
since the company and its subsidiaries transact business in many other countries  some of those sale and purchase transactions are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the company s operations 
as a result  changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the transaction is denominated versus the local currency of the company s operations into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction 
this can result in more or less local currency revenue or cost related to such transaction  and thus have an effect on the operating profit of the company 
this currency transaction risk is mitigated  in part  since some of the revenue and expense transactions of the company s foreign subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars  providing a degree of natural hedging 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on the amount reported in other income expense  net 
once the above indicated receivables and payables from the sale and purchase transactions have been recorded  to the extent currency exchange rates change prior to settlement of the balance  a gain or loss on the non local currency denominated asset or liability balance may be experienced  in which case such gain or loss is included in other income expense  net 
the company utilizes forward and swap contracts and  to a lesser extent  option contracts to selectively hedge its exposure to foreign currency transaction risk when it is practical and economical to do so 
the use of these contracts minimizes transactional exposure to exchange rate changes because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instrument will offset  in whole or in part  the loss or gain on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
these instruments are entered into with well known money center banks  insurance companies or government agencies counterparties 
usually these contracts extend for no more than months 
the company believes that the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged were the counterparties to fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
management of foreign currency transactional exposures was not changed during  and the company does not expect any significant change in such exposures or in the strategies it uses to manage such exposures in the near future 
as of december   a ten percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the functional currencies of the company and its subsidiaries against the prevailing market rates of non local currencies involving the company s transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pre tax loss of approximately million 
these hypothetical gains or losses on foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are defined as the difference between the contract rates and the hypothetical exchange rates 
while the company believes the above loss resulting from the hypothetical unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be material to the company s results of operations  the company reduces this risk by selectively hedging its exposure when it is practical and economical to do so 
in addition to currency transaction risks  the company is also exposed to currency translation risk 
since the financial results of the company s foreign subsidiaries are determined in the local currency of each foreign subsidiary  these financial results are translated into us dollars on a monthly basis in order to determine the company s consolidated financial results 
a weakening of the us dollar versus the local currency of the foreign subsidiary will have a favorable currency translation impact when positive financial results of that foreign subsidiary are translated to us dollars 
the company s foreign currency translation effects typically offset to a significant degree the foreign currency transaction impacts in the company s operating results 
interest rate risk the company holds a combination of variable and fixed rate debt consisting of short and long term instruments 
the company selectively hedges its exposure to interest rate increases on its variable rate long term debt when it is practical and economical to do so 
the company utilizes various forms of interest rate hedge agreements  including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements 
most often the company utilizes variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements  typically with contractual terms no longer than months 
the company s strategy to manage exposure to interest rate changes did not change during  and management does not expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate changes or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 
various outstanding interest bearing instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in fair market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to the company s fixed rate debt outstanding at december   a ten percent change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair market value of such debt and with respect to the company s variable rate debt outstanding at december   a ten percent change in interest rates would not result in a material impact to the company s future annual pre tax earnings 
commodity price risk the company is subject to commodity price risk  the most significant of which relates to the price of wood pulp  which is the company s largest single component of cost 
the per ton cost of wood pulp is cyclical in nature and more volatile than general inflation 
the company consumed approximately   and  metric tons of wood pulp in  and  respectively 
during the period from january through december  the us list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp  a representative pulp grade used by the company  ranged from a low of per metric ton in march and april of to a high of per metric ton in january selling prices of the company s paper products are influenced  in part  by the market price for wood pulp  which is determined by worldwide industry supply and demand 
generally  over time  the company has been able to increase its selling prices in response to increased per ton wood pulp costs and has generally reduced its selling prices when wood pulp costs have significantly declined 
increases in prices of wood pulp could adversely impact the company s earnings if selling prices are not increased or if such increases do not fully compensate for or trail the increases in wood pulp prices 
derivative instruments have not been utilized by the company to manage this risk 
with respect to the company s commodity price risk  a hypothetical ten percent change in per ton wood pulp prices would impact the company s future annual pre tax earnings by approximately million  assuming no compensating change in the company s selling prices 
the company believes that  while its exposure to commodity price risk is material to its results of operations  such risk is understood by its customers and over time changes in the price of wood pulp are typically reflected in selling prices 
general inflation due to competitive pressures  the company is not always able to pass along its cost increases through increased selling prices 
the company s main costs impacted by general inflation are wages and salaries  energy  chemicals  employee benefit costs  primarily medical and pension expenses  and costs of insurance 
seasonality sales of the company s products are not subject to seasonal fluctuations  except in the united states and brazil 
in the united states  customer shutdowns typically occur in july and december and typically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months 
additionally  the us mills shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months  resulting in higher product costs and reduced operating profit 
in brazil  customer orders are typically lower in december due to a holiday season through much of january and february 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to the environmental impact of air  water and other emissions from its mills as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
the company believes it is operating in compliance with  or is taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
while the company has incurred in the past several years  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations  these costs are not expected to materially affect the company s business or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements will not occur at some future time as a result of environmental matters 
additional information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings environmental matters herein 
legal proceedings information concerning legal proceedings is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and its subsidiaries  management believes that such actions and claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
reliance on significant customers most of the company s customers are manufacturers of tobacco products located in more than countries around the world 
two such customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales in each of the last several years  and the loss of one or both such customers  or a significant reduction in one or both of these customers purchases  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco products and governmental actions in recent years  governmental entities around the world  particularly in the united states  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products  to limit smoking in public places and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
in the fourth quarter of  the major us cigarette manufacturers reached agreement with all us states and several commonwealths and territories to settle health care cost recovery and other claims 
in anticipation of these settlements and as a direct result of these settlements  most of the us cigarette manufacturers increased prices of cigarettes significantly 
domestic cigarette consumption has declined  in part due to these price increases which  in turn  decreases demand for the company s products 
during  the us department of justice filed a multi billion dollar civil suit against the tobacco industry 
in addition  litigation is pending against the major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms and for alleged violations of antitrust laws 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry  its financial liquidity or relationships with its suppliers 
also in recent years  certain governmental entities  particularly in the united states  have considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked 
the state of new york enacted a law directing that such a set of requirements be implemented 
on december   the state of new york announced the adoption of final regulations for reduced ignition propensity cigarettes 
the fire safety standard requires that all cigarettes sold in the state of new york as of june  have reduced ignition propensity properties 
the regulations do contain a provision that allows wholesalers and retailers to transition their existing inventories 
cigarette manufacturers are in varying stages of development of cigarettes with such characteristics 
philip morris and the company previously announced the joint development of a banded cigarette paper that may make a cigarette less likely to ignite certain fabrics and have entered into a licensing and royalty agreement covering future commercialization of this new paper 
while the joint development effort with philip morris was undertaken in advance of legislative initiatives in certain states to make cigarettes less likely to ignite certain fabrics when left unattended  the banded cigarette paper product that resulted from the joint development program  marketed under the name paper select by philip morris  is directed toward the same objective as the legislation 
this joint development effort is also discussed in part i  item herein under the caption philip morris supply agreement 
the company also has patents related to alternative means  including print banded cigarette paper  for addressing ignition control and continues to work on other possible innovations with other customers and on its own as the cigarette industry faces meeting these requirements 
in addition to the state of new york  several other states have introduced bills in their respective legislative committees concerning cigarette fire safety standards 
health canada has also indicated that it would evaluate the implementation of new standards that would require cigarette manufacturers to market reduced ignition propensity cigarettes in that country 
there appears to be momentum building for reduced ignition propensity products  and the company currently anticipates that cigarette manufacturers will use banded and print banded cigarette papers to meet these regulatory requirements  however there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the timing and volume requirements the company s customers will have for such papers 
furthermore  it is not possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted  or to what extent  if any  such legislation or regulations might affect the consumer tobacco products industry in general 
during  percent of the company s net sales were from products used by the tobacco industry in the making and packaging of cigarettes or other tobacco products 
management is unable to predict the effects that the above described legal and governmental actions might have on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  particularly in the foregoing discussion regarding the outlook of the company  critical accounting policies and estimates and factors that may affect future results  constitute forward looking statements  generally identified by  but not limited to  phrases such as the company expects or the company anticipates  as well as by use of words of similar effect  such as appears  could  should  may and typically  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to the safe harbor created by that act 
this report contains many such forward looking statements  including statements regarding management s expectations of future selling prices for the company s products  the company s anticipated market shares  future market prices for wood pulp used by the company  expected sales volumes trends  new product introductions  expected outcome of labor negotiations  anticipated compensation  benefit  insurance  depreciation  nonmanufacturing and interest costs  anticipated financial and operational results  anticipated capital spending  anticipated tax and other governmental actions  contingencies  anticipated common stock share repurchases and other expected transactions of the company 
forward looking statements are made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company 
there can be no assurances that such events will occur or that the results of the company will be as estimated 
many factors outside the control of the company also could impact the realization of such estimates 
the above mentioned important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company
