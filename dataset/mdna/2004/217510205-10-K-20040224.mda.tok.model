item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our current operating activities include developing  building and testing the vantedge product line and establishing relationships with our target customers 
in the future  we expect that revenue growth  if any  will be substantially dependent on sales of the vantedge product 
the vantedge product is generally available for sale however  we have yet to generate material revenues from the sale of the vantedge product line 
currently  our revenue is generated primarily from sales of and service on our copperedge dsl concentrators  or ce  and the related wide area network wan modules and line modules  as well as from ce system software upgrade licenses 
additionally  we license network management software  which provides monitoring and management capabilities for the ce  revenues from which have not been material to date 
for the year ended december   sales to our two largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  of which sales to versatel and mpower accounted for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
while the level of sales to any specific customer is anticipated to vary from period to period  we expect that we will continue to have significant customer concentration for the foreseeable future 
our customers buying patterns are unpredictable 
future sales  if any  to the significant customers mentioned above may be substantially less than historical sales 
the loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could among other things reduce or delay our net revenue  adversely impact our ability to sustain or achieve annual or quarterly profitability and adversely impact our ability to generate positive cash flow  and  as a consequence  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we market and sell our products directly to telecommunications service providers and through distributors 
we generally recognize revenue from product sales or sales type leases upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimated and the sales type lease criteria are met 
no revenue is recognized on products shipped on a trial basis 
estimated sales returns  based on historical experience by product  are recorded at the time the product revenue is recognized 
to date  significant revenues generated from international sources are entirely comprised of sales to versatel 
we expect our gross margin to be affected by many factors including competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  costs of components and sub assemblies  costs from our contract manufacturers  the mix of products or system configurations sold and the volume and timing of sales of follow on line cards for systems shipped in prior periods 
as of december   we had a substantial amount of fully reserved finished goods and component inventory for the ce product line 
our reserve had been established based on our projection  which indicated certain inventories would not be used or would be sold below their original cost 
in the future  we could utilize fully reserved components to complete product  which could result in higher gross margins 
the gross margin realized will be highly dependent upon our cost to 
table of contents complete the units and our ability to sustain pricing at current levels which may prove to be difficult given the severe pricing pressures that we are currently experiencing 
in addition  our overall gross margin realized on sales of our products may fluctuate widely and will be highly dependent upon sales mix  utilization of fully reserved inventory  if any  and the prices at which our customers are willing to purchase our products 
we outsource most of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations  and we conduct manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  program management  documentation control and product repairs at our facility in san diego  california 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue during the periods presented consists of payments to our contract manufacturers  which in was principally with plexus corporation 
we selected our manufacturing partner with the goal of ensuring a reliable supply of high quality finished products and of lowering per unit product costs as a result of manufacturing economies of scale 
however  we cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain the volumes required to realize these economies of scale or when or if such cost reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
during the years ended december    and we recorded credits charges to cost of revenue for inventory on hand and on order totaling million  million  and million respectively 
the million credit taken in was related to a reduction in adverse purchase commitments taken in prior periods 
the amounts of the charges were determined based on estimates of the amounts we were committed to purchase and the anticipated demand for our products at the time the charges were taken 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
our customers buying patterns are unpredictable 
accordingly  actual demand for our products could be materially less or more than our estimates 
the ultimate amount of inventory purchase commitments and ultimate amount of excess inventory cost incurred could differ materially from our estimates as a result of these uncertainties 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products and enhancement of our network management software 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product objectives 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as trade shows and promotional expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  human resources  management information systems and administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  bad debt expenses and other general corporate expenses 
prior to  we initiated employee stock option programs and restricted stock programs that required us to record deferred compensation and recognize compensation expense 
we expect that the total amount of compensation expense that will be recognized under these programs will vary from period to period and the ultimate amount of compensation expense that will be recognized is not currently determinable 
during the third quarter of  additional deferred compensation was recorded in conjunction with a grant of restricted stock to two executive officers 
the deferred compensation is being amortized to expense in accordance with fasb interpretations no 
and no 
over the vesting period of the individual options and restricted stock 
we recorded total deferred stock compensation of million from inception to december  and amortized million from inception to december  as of december  approximately  shares of restricted stock remain outstanding and unvested 
approximately  shares of the remaining restricted stock outstanding vests in august of approximately  shares of the remaining restricted stock outstanding vests in july of and the remaining  shares vest quarterly over three years beginning in october the shares are restricted as to sale or transfer until vesting 

table of contents during the year ended december   we recorded a net charge of million in bad debt expense related to an investment in a sales type lease 
this charge was estimated based on an updated credit assessment of the lessee 
during the year ended december   we received approximately million in lease payments under this sales type lease and recorded those payments as a reduction of bad debt expense  which have been included in general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   we received approximately million as a settlement of all remaining amounts due under this lease agreement  which is included as a reduction to general and administrative expenses 
we have had three restructurings since march these restructurings resulted in our adoption of business plans to re size our business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
as a result of the adoption of these plans  we recorded total charges of approximately million 
these charges primarily relate to consolidation of our continuing operations resulting in impairment of assets  anticipated losses on disposition of assets and excess lease costs  and the elimination of job responsibilities  resulting in costs incurred for employee severance 
details of the restructuring charges are as follows in s cash non cash reserve balance at december  charge activity reserve balance at december  impairment of assets non cash   excess lease costs cash    elimination of job responsibilities cash   cash non cash reserve balance at december  charge activity reserve balance at december  impairment of assets non cash excess lease costs cash    elimination of job responsibilities cash cash non cash reserve balance at december  charge activity reserve balance at december  excess lease costs cash    elimination of job responsibilities cash critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
examples include estimated restructuring costs  excess inventory and adverse purchase commitments  provisions for returns  bad debts  warranty costs  and the ultimate realizability of investments and the ultimate outcome of litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents we have several critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
typically  the circumstances that make these judgments complex and difficult have to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows as discussed under warranty reserves in note of the notes to the financial statements  we provide limited warranties on certain of our products  typically for periods of up to one year 
we recognize warranty reserves when products are shipped based upon an estimate of total warranty costs  and such reserves are included in accrued liabilities 
the estimate of such costs is based upon historical and anticipated requirements 
as discussed under inventory in note of the notes to the financial statements  inventory is stated at the lower of cost  principally standard costs  which approximates actual costs on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we estimate the market value of our inventory based upon anticipated future demand for our products 
as discussed under revenue recognition in note of the notes to the financial statements revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales returns are estimated based on historical experience and management s expectations and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 
annual service and support arrangements can be purchased by customers for products no longer under warranty and are generally billed quarterly 
revenue from service and support arrangements is recognized ratably as services are performed 
we may extend limited stock rotation  product return and price protection rights to certain distributors and resellers

future sales  if any  to our significant customers mentioned above may be substantially less than historical sales 
our future sales will be substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully commercialize and sell our vantedge product 
gross margin 
our gross margin decreased from million or in to million or in the decrease in gross margin  relative to the prior year  occurred primarily due to the recognition of a gain of million in related to a reduction in purchase commitments previously charged to cost of revenue in during and we sold inventory that had previously been written down by million and million respectively 
research and development 
our research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower compensation costs as a result of lower headcount  lower depreciation related to fixed assets  and lower spending on prototype equipment  consultants and other outside services 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased as a result of flat sales and decreasing costs during we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods for the primary purpose of developing new products and enhancing our existing products 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in travel and depreciation expense  which was partially offset by an increase in consultant costs and other outside services expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue from in to in was the result of a decrease in cost as noted combined with the increase in our net revenue during general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation expense as a result of lower equipment purchases  reduced facility lease costs as a result of increased sub lease receipts  and reduced legal costs  which savings was partially offset by higher compensation expense 
included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and  is a credit related to the recovery of bad debt in the amount of million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in this decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of the items mentioned above 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease reflects a decrease in interest income generated from lower average cash balances and investments in marketable securities in and decreased average yields on such investments 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was zero for and years ended december  and net revenue 
our revenue decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to significantly fewer sales of our ce products

our customers buying patterns are unpredictable 
future sales  if any  to our significant customers mentioned above may be substantially less than historical sales 
our future sales will be substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully commercialize and sell our vantedge product 

table of contents gross margin 
our gross margin increased from million or in to million or in the increase in gross margin  relative to the prior year  occurred primarily due to million in charges taken during the year ended december  to reduce certain inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
in addition  we recognized a one time gain of million in related to a reduction in purchase commitments previously charged to cost of revenue in and the sale of inventory in that had previously been written down by million 
research and development 
our research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower compensation costs as a result of lower headcount  and lower spending on prototype equipment  employee recruiting and travel costs

we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods for the primary purpose of developing new products and enhancing our existing products 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff  decreased promotional and product marketing expenses  decreased sales commissions associated with lower net revenue  decreased expenses related to customer support and decreased travel costs 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue from in to in was the result of a decrease in cost as noted above which was partially offset by the decrease in our net revenue during general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in bad debt expense  decreased staffing for finance  management information systems  and human resources  and reductions in recruiting and facility related expenses

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in this increase as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of the items mentioned above 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased from million in to zero in we purchased onprem networks corporation on february  for approximately million 
as a result of the purchase we recorded purchased intangibles of approximately million 
immediately following the purchase we wrote off million of in process research and development in for projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which there was no alternative future use 
such amount was determined with the assistance of a third party appraiser based upon the present value of estimated future cash flow contributions from the identified projects 
the remaining purchased intangibles were being amortized over a three year period from the date of the acquisition 
during the second quarter of  we calculated the present value of expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the assets 
this evaluation resulted in a write off of million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the underlying factors contributing to the decline in expected financial results included changes in our strategic focus in the marketplace and an overall decline in the telecommunications equipment market 
in connection with these plans  the onprem product line was discontinued 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease reflects a decrease in interest income generated from lower average cash balances and investments in marketable securities in and decreased average yields on such investments

table of contents liquidity and capital resources currently  we are not generating sufficient revenue to fund our operations 
we expect our operating losses  net operating cash outflows and capital expenditures to continue if we are unable to increase sales 
on march   august   and july   we announced that we had adopted business plans to re size our business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to decrease our operating expenses significantly below current levels and still remain viable and competitive 
if we are unable to realize sufficient savings from re sizing our business  and or sufficiently increase our revenues  our ability to deploy and service our products  fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures could be significantly impaired 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term marketable investments of million 
in the year ended december   we required approximately to million in cash per quarter to fund our operations  and we expect this rate of usage to continue or increase 
based upon our quarterly cash use in  we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations for at least the next fifteen months 
these estimates reflect various assumptions  including the assumption that sales of our existing products will continue at approximately the same levels as in  that testing  continued development and commercialization of our new vantedge product proceeds as planned  that our current sub lease tenants do not default on our sublease agreements  that we do not incur significant additional expense related to litigation  including any adverse determination in the litigation described elsewhere in this form k under the heading legal proceedings 
any of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect 
we have made significant investments in the development of our vantedge product and believe it has significant promise  however it is unclear whether it will be commercially successful and generate revenue to offset the decline of sales of our current products 
presently  vantedge is in trials at a number of carriers and it is uncertain as to whether it will meet the carrier s performance and cost expectations or whether it will require substantial further development 
as a result  the enhancement and commercialization of our vantedge product might be delayed or might require the expenditure of significantly more funds than currently anticipated  in which case our liquidity and capital resources would be adversely affected 
should sufficient funds not be available to fund the commercialization of vantedge  our viability as a going concern may be in doubt 
we currently fund our operations with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments 
in order to fund our operations significantly beyond the first quarter of  we expect that we may have to further reduce our expenses and or raise additional funds 
should any of these or other factors occur  our use of cash may be adversely affected 
this may require management to reduce expenses to have sufficient funds for our operations beyond the first quarter of management believes that such expense reduction  if appropriate  would need to occur during the third quarter of in order for the cost savings to be meaningful to us 
we anticipate that we may have to seek equity or long term debt financing in the private or public capital markets to obtain the funds we need to continue operations and to demonstrate our future viability as a going concern to potential and existing customers 
such capital raising may be made more difficult if we are no longer listed on the nasdaq stock market as a result of our failure to continue to meet the listing requirements required by nasdaq  which is a risk we could face 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to or more favorable than those of the holders of our common stock 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to or more favorable than those of the holders of common stock and the terms and conditions relating to such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 

table of contents additional financing may not be available when needed on terms and conditions favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms and conditions  we may be unable to fund our ongoing operations 
in addition  our inability to obtain additional financing may make us unable to successfully commercialize our vantedge product  damage our customers perceptions of us and our management team  inhibit our ability to sell our products to a customer base which values financial strength and stability  and decrease our stock price 
any or all of these consequences would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
cash used in operating activities for the years ended december    and was  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash used by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in research and development and to a lesser extent a decrease in general and administrative expenses

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our long term debt arrangements and our investments in certain held to maturity securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of interest sensitive financial instruments at december
