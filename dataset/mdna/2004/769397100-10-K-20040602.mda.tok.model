critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified three policies  that due to judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights msr s and the impairment of investments 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussions and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in particular  note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  describes generally the company s accounting policies and note provides details used in valuing the company s msr s and the effect of changes to certain assumptions 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is provided based upon management s continuing analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes techniques to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
mortgage servicing rights the company stratifies its msr s based on the predominant characteristics of the underlying financial assets including coupon interest rate and contractual maturity of the mortgage 
an estimated fair value of msr s is determined quarterly using a discounted cash flow model 
the model estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio based on various factors  such as servicing costs  servicing income  expected prepayments speeds  discount rate  loan maturity and interest rate 
the effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments represents the predominant risk characteristic underlying the msr s portfolio 
the company s methodology for estimating the fair value of msr s is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  the determination of fair value uses anticipated prepayment speeds 
actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value 
thus  any measurement of msr s fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions made as of the date made 
those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different time 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan is paid off earlier than anticipated 
moreover  since most loans within the servicing portfolio do not contain penalty provisions for early payoff  the company will not receive a corresponding economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than expected 
msr s are the discounted present value of the future net cash flows projected from the servicing portfolio 
accordingly  prepayment risk subjects the company s msr s to impairment 
msr s impairment is recorded in the amount that the estimated fair value is less than the msr s carrying value on a strata by strata basis 
investment valuation the company s determination of impairment for various types of investments accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
is predicated on the notion of other than temporary 
the key indicator that an investment may be impaired is that the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value 
each reporting period  the company reviews those investments the fair value is less than carrying value 
the review includes determining whether certain indicators indicated the fair value of the investment has been negatively impacted 
these indicators include deteriorating financial condition  regulatory  economic or technological changes  downgrade by a rating agency and length of time the fair value has been less than carrying value 
if any indicators of impairment are present  management determines the fair value of the investment and compares this to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  the investment is considered impaired and a determination must be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
securities held to maturity are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized in interest income using the interest method 
if the cost basis of these securities is determined to be other than temporary impaired  the amount of the impairment is charged to operations 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value 
premiums and discounts are amortized using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity 
unrealized holding gains and losses  or valuation allowances established for net unrealized losses  are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of income taxes  unless the security is deemed other than temporary impaired 
if the security is determined to be other than temporary impaired  the amount of the impairment is charged to operations 
the company s underlying principle in determining whether impairment is other than temporary is an impairment shall be deemed other than temporary unless positive evidence indicating that an investment s carrying value is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs negative evidence to the contrary 
evidence that is objectively determinable and verifiable is given greater weight than evidence that is subjective and or not verifiable 
evidence based on future events will generally be less objective as it is based on future expectations and therefore is generally less verifiable or not verifiable at all 
factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and c our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time 
in situations in which the security s fair value is below amortized cost but it continues to be probable that all contractual terms of the security will be satisfied  and that the decline is due solely to changes in interest rates not because of increased credit risk  and the company asserts that it has positive intent and ability to hold that security to maturity  no other than temporary impairment is recognized 
operating strategy in the fiscal year ended march   the company began to implement a growth strategy to broaden the products and services from traditional thrift offerings to those more closely related to commercial banking 
the growth strategy included four elements geographic and product expansion  loan portfolio diversification  development of relationship banking and maintenance of asset quality 
since the end of fiscal  the company has added three branches including the branch at the main office for administration in downtown vancouver 
in addition  the july acquisition of today s bancorp  inc added one branch and a commercial lending center 
the washougal branch was relocated to a new facility  and the stevenson  white salmon and goldendale branches were remodeled 
the number of automated teller machines increased from six to seventeen so that each branch location now is serviced by at least one automated teller machine 
the company s growing commercial customer base has enjoyed new products and the improvements in existing products 
these new products include business checking  internet banking and new loan products 
retail customers have benefited from expanded choices ranging from additional automated teller machines  consumer lending products  checking accounts  debit cards  hour account information service and internet banking 
fiscal marked the st anniversary since riverview community bank opened its doors in the historical emphasis has been on residential real estate lending 
the company is focused on diversifying the loan portfolio through expansion of commercial loans 
in fiscal  the company had four experienced commercial lenders and currently there are seven commercial lenders who are expanding the commercial lending services available to riverview s customers 
in the fiscal  commercial loans as a percentage of the loan portfolio were 
commercial loans were of total loans at the end of fiscal year commercial lending has higher credit risk  wider interest margins and shorter loan terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio profitability 
the company s relationship banking has been enhanced by the addition of ram corp  a trust company directed by experienced trust officers  through expanded loan products serviced by experienced commercial and consumer lending officers  and an expanded branch network led by experienced branch managers 
development of relationship banking has been the key to the company s growth 
the fair market value of assets under management has increased from million at march   to million at march  net interest income the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income it receives on interest earning assets and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is also affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets equal or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the level of non interest income and expenses also affects the company s profitability 
non interest income includes deposit service fees  income associated with the origination and sale of mortgage loans  brokering loans  loan servicing fees  income from real estate owned  net gains and losses on sales of interest earning assets  bank owned life insurance income and asset management fee income 
non interest expenses include compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  deposit insurance premiums  data servicing expenses and other operating costs 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government legislation and regulation  and monetary and fiscal policies 
comparison of financial condition at march  and at march   the company had total assets of million compared with million at march  the increase in total assets reflects the july acquisition of today s bancorp 
the increase in total assets was primarily an increase in loans outstanding  goodwill and bank owned life insurance 
cash  including interest earning accounts  totaled million at march   compared to million at march  the million decrease in loans held for sale to  at march  compared to million at march   reflects the variable demand for residential loan refinancing 
as interest rates fall  loan volume shifts to fixed rate production 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  loan volume will shift to adjustable rate production 
selling fixed interest rate mortgage loans allows the company to reduce the interest rate risk associated with long term fixed interest rate products 
it also frees up funds to make new loans and diversify the loan portfolio 
we continue to service the loans we sell  maintaining the customer relationship and generating ongoing non interest income 
loans receivable  net  were million at march   compared to million at march   a increase 
the acquisition of today s bancorp in july increased gross loans million 
the increases were primarily in commercial  land  commercial real estate and residential construction  consumer loans were partially offset by decreases in one to four family residential  multi family  multi family construction and commercial construction loans

cash decreased to million at march   from million at march  as a result of investment in securities and bank owned life insurance 
investment securities available for sale was million at march   compared to million at march  the million increase reflects the million of securities acquired in the today s bancorp acquisition  and purchase of million of securities  called and paydowns of million and unrealized market gains and losses 
mortgage backed securities held to maturity was million at march   compared to million at march  the  decrease was a result of pay downs 
mortgage backed securities available for sale was million at march   compared to million at march  the million net decrease reflects million in purchases and million in paydowns and unrealized market gains and losses 
deposits totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the deposit increase is primarily due to the increase in non interest bearing account balances 
checking accounts and money market accounts transaction accounts total average outstanding balance increased to million at march   compared to million at march  transaction accounts represented and of average total outstanding balance of deposits at march  and march   respectively 
fhlb advances were million at march  and there were no new borrowings in fiscal year shareholders equity increased million to million at march  from million at march  the increase was primarily as a result of the million of stock issued in the acquisition of today s bancorp and million of total comprehensive income  offset by million stock repurchased and retired and million of cash dividends paid to shareholders 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income 
net income was million  or per diluted share for the year ended march   compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended march  earnings were lower for the year ended march   primarily as a result of the pre tax other than temporary non cash charges of million for fhlmc preferred stock and  for fnma preferred stock 
net interest income 
net interest income for fiscal year was million  representing a million  or a increase  from fiscal year this improvement reflected a increase in average balance of interest earning assets primarily increases in the average balance of non mortgage loans  investment securities and daily interest bearing assets  partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities to million  which was offset by a increase in average balance of interest bearing liabilities a increase in all deposit categories and a decrease in fhlb borrowings to million 
the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal which indicates that the interest earning asset growth is being funded more by interest bearing liabilities as compared to capital and non interest bearing demand deposits 
interest income 
interest income totaled million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal the decreased yield is the primarily the result of the lower yields on loans that reflect the federal reserve board discount rate cuts that occurred during fiscal years and interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended march  totaled million  a million decrease from million for the year ended march  the decrease in interest expense is the result of lower rates of interest paid on deposits and fhlb borrowings due to the federal reserve board discount rate cuts that occurred during fiscal years and the weighted average interest rate of total deposits decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the level of liquidity in fiscal year allowed the runoff of high interest rate deposits acquired in the acquisition of today s bancorp and held the fhlb borrowings stable at million 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended march  was  compared to  for the year ended march  the fiscal provision for loan losses was less than the million net charge offs for the year 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at march  from million at march  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total net loans increased to compared to at march  net charge offs to average net loans for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the increase in the balance of the allowance for loan losses at march  reflects the acquisition of today s bancorp  the proportionate increase in loan balances  the change in mix of loan balances  the increase in substandard assets and a change in loss rate when compared to march  the acquisition of today s bancorp added million to the allowance for loan losses and approximately  of the charge offs was related to loans acquired in the acquisition 
the mix of the loan portfolio showed an increase in the balances of commercial  commercial real estate loans  and construction  and consumer loans at march  as compared to balances at march  substandard assets increased by million to million at march  compared to million at march  the balance of substandard asset of million at march  is a decrease of million from the million balance of substandard assets after the acquisition of today s bancorp 
the loss rate for other mention loans was increased from at march  to at march  in order to reflect the risk of loss 
management considered the allowance for loan losses at march  to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio the company establishes a general reserve for loan losses through a periodic provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
the provisions for loan losses are based on management s estimate of net realizable value or fair value of the collateral  as applicable  and the company s actual loss experience  and standards applied by the ots and the fdic 
the company regularly reviews its loan portfolio  including non performing loans  to determine whether any loans require classification or the establishment of appropriate reserves 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require the company to provide additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
the allowance for loan losses is provided based upon management s continuing analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes techniques to estimate the fair value of the loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves subjective judgments regarding future events  and thus there can be no assurance those additional provisions for credit losses will not be required in future periods 
although management uses the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
any increase or decrease in the provision for loan losses has a corresponding negative or positive effect on net income 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million or for the twelve months ended march  to million compared to million for the same period in excluding the fiscal million pretax loss on sale of securities and other than temporary impairment on equity investments  non interest income increased  or for the year ended march  when compared to the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the loan servicing income of  for fiscal year compared to a loss of  for fiscal year the increase in loan servicing income for fiscal year reflects the  increase in market valuation of mortgage servicing rights in fiscal as compared to the  write down of mortgage servicing rights in fiscal for the year ended march   fees and service charges increased  or when compared to the year ended march  the  increase in fees and service charges is primarily due to the  or  growth in fee income from deposit services that was offset by the  decrease in mortgage broker fees in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the rise in mortgage rates experienced in fiscal reduced the volume of mortgage refinance activity as compared to the mortgage finance activity in fiscal the reduced mortgage refinance activity resulted in reduced mortgage broker activity and reduced gains on sale of loans held for sale 
mortgage brokered loan production decreased from million in to million in mortgage broker fees included in fees and service charges totaled million for the year ended march  compared to million for the previous year 
mortgage broker commission compensation expense was  for the fiscal ended march  compared to million for the fiscal ended march  asset management services income was  for the fiscal year compared to  for the fiscal year ramcorp 
had million in total assets under management at march  compared to million at march  in fiscal year  the bank purchased million of bank owned life insurance that increased non interest income by  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year one measure of a bank s ability to contain non interest expense is the efficiency ratio 
it is calculated by dividing total non interest expense less intangible asset amortization by the sum of net interest income plus non interest income less intangible asset amortization and lower of cost or market adjustments 
the company s efficiency ratio excluding intangible asset amortization and lower cost or market adjustments was in fiscal compared to in fiscal merger related expenses that were non capitalizable were not material to the company in fiscal year the principal component of the company s non interest expense is salaries and employee benefits 
for the year ended march   salaries and employee benefits  which includes mortgage broker commission compensation  was million  or a increase over the prior year total of million 
full time equivalent employees increased to at march  from at march  the primary reason for the increase was the expansion of lending and branch locations and the related staffing resulting from the acquisition of today s bancorp 
this expansion also contributed to increase expense in occupancy  depreciation  data processing  telecommunication and other expense 
the acquisition of today s bancorp and the related acquisition of million in deposits accounts created an  core deposit intangibles cdi  representing the excess of cost over fair market of acquired deposits 
the cdi is being amortized over a ten year life using an accelerated amortization method 
the amortization expense was  for fiscal the acquisition of the hazel dell and longview branches from the resolution trust corporation in fiscal see item properties  and the related acquisition of million in customer deposits created a million core deposit intangible asset  representing the excess of fair value of deposits over the acquired cost 
the cdi  at march  is being amortized over the remaining life of the underlying customer relationships currently estimated at two months 
the amortization expense of cdi was  for both fiscal years and provision for federal income taxes 
provision for federal income taxes was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  as a result of higher income before taxes in the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal reference is made to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in
