overview presstek is a developer  manufacturer  and marketer of digital laser imaging and chemistry free plate technologies for the printing and graphic arts industries 
presstek s products and applications incorporate its patented direct imaging di technologies and consumables for direct to press and computer to plate ctp applications 
presstek s di technology enables direct to press or on press imaging  whereby the printing plates are imaged on the press directly from digital files  bypassing numerous prepress procedures and chemical processes in preparing jobs for presswork 
our imaging technology also enables computer to plate or off press imaging whereby operators of conventional printing presses image plates directly from digital files to a ctp device 
the printer then uses these imaged plates on a traditional printing press  but without the chemical processes required for conventional plates 
our patented di thermal laser diode product family enables customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively than conventional methods 
presstek s patented di  ctp and plate products eliminate photographic darkrooms  film  and toxic chemical processing  which results in reduced printing cycle time  lowers the effective cost of production for commercial printers 
presstek solutions make it easier for printers to meet increasing customer demand for shorter print runs  faster turnaround times and improved cost competitiveness  with an environmentally friendly process that avoids the chemicals associated with plate development 
our di technologies are marketed to leading press manufacturers to be incorporated into their direct imaging presses  and used in our dimension series of ctp systems 
our patented profire laser imaging system  and our recently introduced profire excel imaging system  represent the next generation technology which can be adapted to many di presses and ctp devices 
presstek s dimension ctp systems incorporate the profire system and use our chemistry free printing plates  applause and anthem 
lasertel  inc lasertel  a subsidiary of presstek  is primarily engaged in the manufacture and development of high powered laser diodes 
lasertel s products include semiconductor lasers and active components for the graphics and defense industries 
lasertel offers high powered laser diodes in both standard and customized configurations  including chip on sub mount  un mounted bars  and fiber coupled devices  to support various applications 
we operate in two reportable segments  the digital imaging products segment and the lasertel segment 
the digital imaging products segment is primarily engaged in the development  manufacture and sale of patented digital imaging systems and printing plate technologies for direct to press  or on press  applications and ctp  or off press  applications 
the lasertel segment is primarily engaged in the development and manufacture of high powered laser diodes for use by presstek and for sale to external customers 
we generate revenue through four main sources the sale of our equipment  including di presses  ctp devices  and imaging kits incorporated by leading press manufacturers into direct imaging presses for the graphic arts industry  the sale of high powered laser diodes for the industrial and defense industries  the sale of our proprietary consumables  and license agreements with manufacturers that incorporate our technology into their products 
our business strategy is centered on maximizing the sale of consumable products  and therefore our business efforts focus on the sale of consumable burning engines such as our di presses and ctp devices 
we rely on partnerships with press manufacturers such as ryobi  heidelberg and kba to manufacture presses that use our proprietary consumables 
we also rely on distribution partners  such as kpg and ab dick  to sell and distribute press and ctp systems and the related proprietary consumable products 
historically we have been reliant on heidelberg for a material share of our revenue 
in fiscal  we initiated a process to evaluate our resources and strategically re focus the business 
during this re alignment  we 
table of contents concluded to reposition and rescale our resources  and implemented cost savings programs in fiscal and to return to profitability 
we expanded our strategic relationships with other press manufacturers and distributors such as ryobi  kba  and kpg to develop and distribute presses that incorporate our imaging technology and use our proprietary consumables  so as to lessen our reliance on any one partner 
we established a relationship with ab dick to sell presstek ctp devices and consumables under their brand name 
we are working with other ctp manufacturers to qualify our consumables on their systems 
we believe this shift in strategy fundamentally enhances presstek s ability to expand and control its business 
our revenue for fiscal was negatively impacted by the continued global economic slowdown  and specifically by the weakness in the graphic arts industry 
this economic slowdown has led to a reduction in spending for capital equipment  such as presses and ctp systems that utilize di technology 
in addition  revenue from our quickmaster di platform decreased by million in as a result of equipment and consumable inventory adjustments made by heidelberg 
offsetting this revenue decline was an increase in revenue of million in from presstek s new technology business  which consists of all product lines not related to the quickmaster di platform 
we operate and report on a or week fiscal year  ending on the saturday closest to december accordingly  the financial statements include the week fiscal year ended january  fiscal  and the week fiscal years ended december  fiscal and december  fiscal 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal revenue revenue for fiscal of million consisted of product sales  customer support revenue  royalties and license fees 
revenue for fiscal increased million or as compared to million for fiscal product sales for the digital imaging products segment  including equipment and consumables  were million for fiscal  an increase of million or  as compared to million for fiscal this increase in product sales was due primarily to volume increases in our ctp dimension products and press products 
these increases were partially offset by volume decreases of direct imaging kits sold to heidelberg for use in the quickmaster di and decreased press shipments to xerox  as well as volume decreases in the sale of our consumable products 
the revenue generated from the sale of consumable products was million for fiscal  a decrease of million or  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease in revenue from consumables is primarily the result of volume decreases of our quickmaster di consumables  as well as price reductions on sales of these consumables through select dealers in our european distribution channel 
consumable product revenue includes sales under the company s agreements with heidelberg and its distributors of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue generated from services related to customer support  including installation and service contract revenue  was million or of revenue for fiscal  an increase of  as compared to million or of revenue for fiscal this increase is due primarily to an increase in the sale of service maintenance agreements related to our ctp dimension products 
royalties and license fees for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or  as compared to royalties and license fees of million for fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased shipments to heidelberg of direct imaging kits used in the quickmaster di 
heidelberg has indicated  that as a result of the global economic slowdown  it has an inventory of direct imaging kits on hand to support its production requirements 
we currently believe that orders from heidelberg for direct imaging kits will resume sometime late in fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that any orders will be received at this time 
revenue generated under the company s agreements with heidelberg and its distributors was million for fiscal  a decrease of million or  as compared to million for fiscal revenue from heidelberg represented and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents revenue generated under the company s agreements with kba and its distributors was million for fiscal  an increase of million or  as compared to million for fiscal revenue from kba represented and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
these increases are primarily the result of increased 
press 
sales to kba 
in july  we entered into oem consumable supply agreements with heidelberg and heidelberg usa that provide us with certain preferred supplier rights  which vary based on territory  time period and sales volume 
under the terms of the oem agreements  which include minimum volume commitments from heidelberg and heidelberg usa  we will manufacture and supply heidelberg branded consumable plate products for the heidelberg quickmaster di press 
shipments to heidelberg of the branded consumable product began in august we currently have no orders from heidelberg for direct imaging kits used in the quickmaster di 
heidelberg has indicated  that as a result of the global economic slowdown  it has an inventory of direct imaging kits on hand to support its production requirements for six months 
we believe that orders for direct imaging kits will resume sometime late in fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that any orders will be received 
in march  we expanded the product offerings to select dealers in our european distribution channel to include the sale of quickmaster di consumables 
in connection with this offering  we reduced pricing on our full line of spooled consumables distributed through this distribution channel by up to 
while the expected lost revenue resulting from the price reduction may be offset by increased revenue from increased volume of spooled consumable sales derived from additional presses installed and increased usage of spooled consumables  there can be no assurance that this expected lost revenue will be offset 
in addition  market conditions may require us to expand the regions in which we offer reduced prices  or to further reduce our spooled consumable prices  which could further reduce our revenues in and beyond 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
in march  we terminated our supply and distribution agreement with xerox for docucolor di presses 
xerox will no longer sell the docucolor di  the docucolor di and the docucolor di presses and related consumables 
the revenue generated from the sale of these presses was not material in fiscal or fiscal  and as a result  the termination of this agreement is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

table of contents special charges and discontinued programs in the second quarter of fiscal  presstek initiated a process to evaluate its resources and strategically re focus the business 
during this process  we evaluated all aspects of the business  and concluded to reposition and rescale our resources 
as part of this exercise  we initiated various repositioning actions during the second quarter of fiscal these actions included the following i creation of market focused direct imaging di and computer to plate ctp product lines  ii creation of a new senior management organization  iii discontinuance of certain programs  and iv consolidation of our hampshire drive research and development facility into the main executive drive facility in hudson  nh

heidelberg is marketing a competitive plate product as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for the quickmaster di 
the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its agreements with heidelberg  including the oem consumables supply agreements entered into in july it could also lead to downward pricing pressure on our full line of spooled consumable products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations  and cash available under our revolver should be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing  or that such additional financing  if needed  will be available on acceptable terms 
effect of inflation inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on our operations 
net operating loss carryforwards as of january   we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million  of which million resulted from stock option compensation deductions for tax purposes and million resulted from operating losses 
to the extent net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation deductions become realizable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards that may be utilized in any future period may be subject to certain limitations  based upon changes in the ownership of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates general presstek s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  presstek evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  and litigation 
presstek bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition presstek recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured  and no further services are required 
we record revenue for product sales net of estimated returns  which are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of return 
revenue and related royalties for products sold where installation is not required is recorded at the time of shipment 
revenue for products that require installation  for which the installation is not deemed inconsequential  is recognized upon completion of installation and customer acceptance 
revenue related to service maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the duration of the particular contract 
certain fees and other reimbursements are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed or the revenue otherwise earned 
deferred revenue includes certain customer advances received as a result of our distribution agreements 
this revenue is recognized as product is shipped or services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts presstek evaluates its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific customer circumstances and on its historical rate of write offs 
we include any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible  along with a general reserve  in an overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
after reasonable attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts as of january  is adequate  however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded allowance 
product warranties presstek warrants its products against defects in material and workmanship for various periods  determined by the product  generally from a period of ninety days to a period of one year from the date of installation 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as intangible assets and property and equipment  are required to be evaluated for impairment annually  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets will be written down to fair value 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the 
table of contents accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities  specifically  how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
eitf does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 fin no 
which requires all variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the vie 
in addition  the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated  as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests  but not the majority 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for all financial statements issued after january  the consolidation requirements of this interpretation are effective for all periods beginning after june  we do not have any vies  therefore the adoption of this interpretation did not have any effect on our results of operations or financial condition

we are substantially dependent on heidelberg for a material portion of our revenue and the loss of heidelberg as a customer or a significant reduction in revenue from sales to heidelberg would adversely affect our business 
we have had an important long term relationship with heidelberg 
since entering into our strategic alliance with heidelberg  our sales of products to heidelberg have constituted a material portion of our total revenue 
for our  and fiscal years our sales to heidelberg accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our total revenue 
there can be no assurance that our relationship with heidelberg will continue 
the loss of heidelberg as a customer  or a material decrease in the revenue we receive from direct imaging kit sales or consumable sales to heidelberg  would have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
heidelberg is marketing a competitive plate product  as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for the quickmaster di 
the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its agreements with heidelberg  including the oem agreements entered into in july it could also lead to downward pricing pressure on our full line of spooled consumable products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we currently have no orders from heidelberg for direct imaging kits used in the quickmaster di 
heidelberg has recently indicated  as a result of the global economic slowdown  that it has an inventory of direct imaging kits on hand to support its production requirements for six months 
we believe that orders for direct imaging kits will resume sometime late in fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that any orders will be received 
in july  we settled our outstanding arbitration proceedings with heidelberg 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement  presstek and heidelberg agreed that the licensing arrangements for the heidelberg quickmaster di would be non exclusive 
as a result of the recognition of the non exclusivity of our license to heidelberg  we agreed to reduce the royalty payable by heidelberg for imaging kits delivered in connection with the heidelberg quickmaster di by approximately  per kit 
this reduced royalty rate was effective for kits ordered and delivered after may  there can be no assurance that we will not have disputes with 
table of contents heidelberg in the future  including disputes involving patents  there can be no assurance that any disputes that do arise will be resolved in our favor 
we are substantially dependent on our strategic alliances and manufacturing and distribution relationships to develop and grow our business and the loss or failure of one or more of our strategic partners could significantly harm our business 
our strategy to date has been  in part  to enter into strategic alliances with major companies in the graphic arts industry and other markets 
this strategy has included  among other things  licensing our intellectual property  developing specialized products based on our proprietary technologies and manufacturing imaging systems for inclusion in other manufacturers products 
our strategy has also involved identifying strategic manufacturing and distribution partners to aid in developing new market channels for our products 
this strategy led to the development of our relationship with heidelberg 
it also led to the development of relationships with other strategic partners  including kba  ryobi and kpg 
we are dependent on many of these partners for future sales of both existing and planned products 
this dependency means that the timetable for finalizing development  commercialization and distribution of both existing and planned products is dependent upon the needs and circumstances of our strategic partners 
we have experienced and will continue to experience technical difficulties from time to time  which may prevent us from meeting certain production and distribution targets 
any delay in meeting production and distribution targets with our strategic partners may harm our relationships with them and may cause them to terminate their relationship with us 
our strategic partners may not develop markets for our products at the pace or in the manner we expect  which may have an adverse effect on our business 
they may also terminate their relationships with us for circumstances beyond our control  including factors unique to their business or their business decisions 
in addition  we may mutually agree with one of our partners to terminate our relationship with them for a variety of reasons 
for example  in march  we agreed with xerox to terminate our supply and distribution agreement with them for docucolor di presses 
as a result  xerox will no longer sell the docucolor di  the docucolor di and the docucolor di presses and related consumables 
while we do not believe the termination of our relationship with xerox will have a material adverse impact on our business  we cannot assure you that the termination of any of our other relationships with our strategic partners will not have an adverse impact on our business 
we are also unable to control factors related to the business of our strategic partners 
as an example  in february  adast  a manufacturing partner of ours  announced that it had joined a bankruptcy petition filed by its creditors 
as a result of this development  we adjusted our fiscal fourth quarter net income and balance sheet to include an additional write off of approximately million to cover prepayments made to adast for work in progress 
there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur with our other strategic partners 
as a result of the uncertainties surrounding many of our strategic partners  there can be no assurance that our existing strategic relationships will prove successful 
there can be no assurance that our existing relationships with heidelberg  kba  ryobi  or kpg or any of our other strategic  manufacturing and distribution partners will be successful 
the loss of heidelberg  kba  ryobi  kpg or other principal customers or strategic partners could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
while we continue to explore possibilities for additional strategic relationships and alliances  there can be no assurance we will be successful in this regard 
our failure to develop new relationships and alliances could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and therefore we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues 
our products have a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our operating results 
customers view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers generally evaluate our products and determine their impact on existing infrastructure over a lengthy period of time 
our sales cycle has historically ranged from approximately one to six months based on the customer s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the customer is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the sale of our products may be subject to delays if the customer has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a customer s evaluation period 
larger customers may purchase our products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned 
table of contents administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed to another quarter  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
we may not be able to increase revenues if we do not expand our sales and distribution channels 
we will need to expand our global sales operations in order to increase market awareness and acceptance of our line of products and generate increased revenues 
we market and distribute our products indirectly through our global partner and distributor network 
we believe that our future success is dependent upon expansion of global distribution channels 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our current relationship or establish relationships with additional distribution partners on a timely basis  or at all 
our distribution partners may not devote adequate resources to promoting or selling our line of products and may not be successful 
any failure to expand our global distribution channel or increase the productivity of this distribution channel could result in lower than anticipated revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
in march  we expanded our product offerings to select dealers in our european distribution channel to include the sale of quickmaster di consumables 
in connection with this offering  we reduced pricing on our full line of spooled consumables distributed through this distribution channel by up to 
while the expected lost revenue resulting from the price reduction may be offset by increased revenue from increased volume of spooled consumable sales derived from additional presses installed and increased usage of spooled consumables  there can be no assurance that the expected lost revenue will be offset 
in addition  market conditions may require us to expand the regions in which we offer reduced prices  or to further reduce our spooled consumable prices  which could further reduce our revenues in and beyond 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
our growth strategy may include licenses or acquisitions of technologies or businesses  which entail a number of risks 
as part of our strategy to grow our business  we may pursue licenses of technologies from third parties or acquisitions of complementary products lines or companies  and such transactions entail a number of risks 
we may expend significant costs in investigating and pursuing such transactions  and such transactions may not be consummated 
if such transactions are consummated  we may not be successful in integrating the acquired technology or business into our existing business to achieve the desired synergies 
integrating acquired technologies or businesses may also require a substantial commitment of our management s time and attention 
we may expend significant funds to acquire such technologies or businesses  and we may incur unforeseen liabilities in connection with any acquisition of a technology or business 
any of the foregoing risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
we face risks associated with international sales 
we intend to expand our global sales operations and enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
international sales are subject to a variety of risks  including difficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels  in serving and supporting products sold outside the united states and in translating products and related materials into foreign languages 
international operations are also subject to difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  staffing and managing personnel and enforcing intellectual property rights 
other factors that can adversely affect international operations include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates  changes in import export duties and quotas  introduction of tariff or non tariff barriers and economic or political changes in international markets 
if our international sales increase  our revenues may also be affected to a greater extent by seasonal fluctuations resulting from lower levels of sales that typically occur during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have a history of losses  could incur substantial losses in the future  and may not maintain profitability 
we have incurred substantial net losses from continuing operations in three of the past five fiscal years 
we incurred net losses from continuing operations of approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal as of january  we had an accumulated 
table of contents deficit of approximately million 
we may need to generate significant increases in revenues to maintain profitability  and we may not be able to do so 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  due to potential competitive pricing pressures  or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be materially adversely affected 
even if we maintain profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis  we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability 
failure to sustain profitability may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are sometimes difficult to predict  have varied in the past  and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
we typically realize a significant percentage of our revenues for a fiscal quarter in the third month of the quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results may be difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter 
any inability to obtain sufficient orders or to fulfill shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenues targets 
in addition  we base our current and future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are largely fixed in the short term and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
accordingly  a revenues shortfall in a particular quarter would have an adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including  without limitation changes in demand for our products and consumables  including seasonal differences  and changes in the mix of our products and consumables 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for critical components and our inability to maintain an adequate supply of advanced laser diodes and other critical components could adversely affect us 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for critical components and our increased demand for these components may put strain on the ability of our third party suppliers to deliver critical components in a timely manner 
for example  our requirements for advanced technology laser diodes for use in products incorporating our di technology has increased and is expected to increase in the future 
although we have established our subsidiary  lasertel  to help us meet our demand for laser diodes  we are still dependent on other third party manufacturers for our supply of other necessary components 
if we are unable for any reason to secure an uninterrupted source of other critical components at prices acceptable to us  our operations could be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that lasertel will be able to manufacture advanced laser diodes in quantities that will fulfill our future needs  or with manufacturing volumes or yields that will make our operation cost effective 
likewise  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative suppliers for our laser diodes or other critical components should our current supply channels prove ineffective 
our manufacturing capabilities may be insufficient to meet the demand for our products 
if demand for our products grows  our current manufacturing capabilities may be insufficient to meet this demand  resulting in production delays and a failure to deliver products in a timely fashion 
we may be forced to seek alternative manufacturers for our products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to do so 
as we introduce new products  we may face production and manufacturing delays due to technical and other unforeseen problems 
any manufacturing delay could have an adverse effect on our business  the success of any product affected by the delay  and our revenue  and may harm our relationships with our strategic partners 
recently introduced products that incorporate our technology may not be commercially successful and may not gain market acceptance 
achieving market acceptance for any products incorporating our technology requires substantial marketing and distribution efforts and expenditure of significant sums of money and allocation of significant resources  either by us  our strategic partners or both 
we may not have sufficient resources to do so 
additionally  there can be no assurance that products introduced by our strategic partners  such as the karat di presses  and the kpg di presses  or our product offerings such as our anthem plates  and dimension and dimension platesetters  will achieve widespread market acceptance or that any of our other current products or any future products that we may develop or any future products produced by others that incorporate our technologies will achieve market acceptance or become commercially successful 
we recently announced beta testing of our new applause plate 
there can be no assurance that the beta testing of this plate will be successful  that the final product will be introduced in the time frame expected  or that it will achieve 
table of contents market acceptance or become commercially successful 
if our new product offerings do not achieve anticipated market acceptance  we may not achieve anticipated revenue 
recently introduced products that incorporate our technology may result in substantial support costs and warranty expenditures 
introducing new products carries substantial risk 
while we do substantial testing on our new products before introducing them to our customers  no amount of testing can replace or approximate actual field conditions at our customer locations 
as a result  when we introduce new products we can incur increased expenditures in ensuring that the new product meets and performs in accordance with its specifications 
we cannot  however  always estimate precisely the expected costs that may arise out of new product installations 
as an example of this  we incurred increased warranty and support costs in fiscal and due to unanticipated product performance issues associated with our new dimension product line 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur increased warranty  support and other costs associated with new product introductions in the future 
in addition  the occurrence of these expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if the united states and global economies slow down  the demand for our products could decrease and our revenues might be hurt 
the demand for our products is affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  general economic conditions may not recover as quickly as forecasted  and may affect or delay the overall capital spending by businesses and consumers  particularly for capital equipment such as presses 
we believe that  concurrently with the most recent economic slowdown in the us and abroad  and the decrease in capital equipment spending over the past three years  there has been a decrease in spending and spending projections on capital equipment that could impact the demand for our products 
if  as a result of general economic uncertainty or otherwise  companies reduce their product spending levels  such a decrease in spending could substantially reduce demand for our products  substantially harm our business  and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the expansion of lasertel into areas other than the production of laser diodes for our printing business may be unsuccessful 
lasertel  which was formed for the purpose of supplying us with laser diodes  has also explored other markets for its laser technology 
these efforts to develop other markets were scaled back  in part  in june  as we announced a repositioning of lasertel in order to reduce its costs and focus its efforts on supplying us with high quality laser diodes 
while the plans to market its laser products to the telecommunications industry were delayed  lasertel has developed laser products for the defense industry and has continued its plans to develop laser prototypes for qualification in the defense and industrial industries 
there can be no assurance that these products or prototypes will gain acceptance in these industries and likewise  there can be no assurance that these products will be commercially successful 
our executive team has limited experience in the telecommunications  defense and industrial industries and there can be no assurance that lasertel will be able to successfully exploit any opportunities that may arise 
lasertel may require additional working capital infusions from us  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our subsidiary  lasertel  was established to help us meet our demand for laser diodes 
lasertel has required and may continue to require a significant amount of capital investment by presstek in order to fund its operations 
for the fiscal year ended january   lasertel recorded a net loss of million 
lasertel continues to require us to advance cash and resources in order to ensure its continued operation 
lasertel has only had sales to a limited number of third parties to date  and any loss of such customers or significant reduction in their purchases from lasertel could increase its reliance upon us for capital and resources 
lasertel s capital and working capital needs may exceed our ability to provide such funds  requiring us to borrow against our credit facilities or seek to obtain outside financing for lasertel s operations 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success is dependent on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary rights 
our future success will depend  in large part  upon our intellectual property rights  including patents  trademarks  trade secrets  proprietary know how  source codes and continuing technological innovation 
we have been issued a number of us and foreign patents and we intend to register for additional patents where we deem appropriate 
we also hold seven registered trademarks and we may register additional trademarks where we deem appropriate 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the issuance of any additional patents or trademarks or the breadth or 
table of contents degree of protection that our patents  trademarks or other intellectual property may afford us 
the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
further  the laws of certain territories in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
there is rapid technological development in the electronic image reproduction industries  resulting in extensive patent filings and a rapid rate of issuance of new patents 
although we believe that our technology has been independently developed and that the products we market do not infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of others  it is possible that such infringement of existing or future patents or violation of proprietary rights may occur 
in this regard  third parties may in the future assert claims against us concerning our existing products or with respect to future products under development by us 
in such event  we may be required to modify our product designs or obtain a license 
no assurance can be given that we would be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions or even at all 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
furthermore  we have agreements with several of our strategic partners which require us to indemnify the strategic partner from claims made by third parties against our intellectual property  and to defend the validity of the patents or otherwise ensure the technology s availability to the strategic partner 
an indemnification claim under any such agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in september  presstek filed an action against fuji photo film corporation  ltd  in the district court of mannheim  germany for patent infringement 
in this action  presstek alleges that fuji has manufactured and distributed a product that violates presstek european patent registered under number de with the german patent and trademark office 
presstek seeks an order from the court that fuji refrain from offering the infringing product for sale  from using the infringing material or introducing it for the named purposes  or from possessing such infringing material 
we may take legal action to determine the validity and scope of third party rights or to defend against any allegations of infringement 
in the course of pursuing or defending any of these actions we could incur significant costs and diversion of our resources 
due to the competitive nature of our industry  it is unlikely that we could increase our product prices to cover such costs 
there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to successfully defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
moreover  we may be unable  for financial or other reasons  to enforce our rights under any patents we may own 
as an example of the cost and uncertainty of patent litigation  in august creo filed an action in the united states district court for the district of delaware against us seeking a declaration that creo s products do not and will not infringe any valid and enforceable claims of any of our patents in question 
we counterclaimed against creo for patent infringement of certain of our patents 
the matter went to trial in june  and in september  the court affirmed the validity and enforceability of our on press imaging patents  but held that the current creo dop system did not infringe on our patents 
creo appealed the court s decision that our patents were valid and enforceable  and we cross appealed the finding of non infringement by the current creo dop system 
on september   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the lower court s decision that our patents are valid and enforceable  but that they are not infringed by the current creo dop system 
we incurred higher than expected legal expenses in fiscal and fiscal due to this litigation 
any similar litigation in the future is expected to be costly  yield uncertain results and could have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also rely on proprietary know how and employ various methods to protect the source codes  concepts  trade secrets  ideas and documentation relating to our proprietary software and laser diode technology 
however  such methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such know how or obtain access to our know how or software codes  concepts  trade secrets  ideas and documentation 
although we have and expect to have confidentiality agreements with our employees and appropriate vendors  there can be no assurance  however  that such arrangements will adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how 

table of contents we face substantial competition in the sale of our products 
we compete with manufacturers of conventional presses and products utilizing existing plate making technology  as well as presses and other products utilizing new technologies  including other types of direct to plate solutions such as companies that employ electrophotography as their imaging technology 
canon inc  hewlett packard company  heidelberg  kodak and xerox corporation are companies that have introduced color electrophotographic copier products 
various companies are marketing product versions manufactured by these companies 
we are also aware that there is a direction in the graphic arts industry to create stand alone computer to plate imaging devices for single and multi color applications 
most of the major corporations in the graphic arts industry have developed and or are developing and marketing off press computer to plate imaging systems 
to date  devices manufactured by our competitors  for the most part  utilize printing plates that require a post imaging photochemical developing step  and in some cases  also require a heating process 
potential competitors in this area include  among others  agfa gevaert nv  dai nippon screen manufacturing ltd  heidelberg and creo 
we also anticipate competition from plate manufacturing companies that manufacture printing plates  or have the potential to manufacture digital thermal plates 
these companies include agfa gevaert nv  kpg and fuji photo film co  ltd 
heidelberg is marketing a competitive plate product as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for the quickmaster di 
the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its relationship with heidelberg  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
products incorporating our technologies can also be expected to face competition from conventional methods of printing and creating printing plates 
most of the companies marketing competitive products  or with the potential to do so  are well established  have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than us and have established reputations for success in the development  sale and service of products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
while we believe we have strong intellectual property protection covering many of our technologies  there is no assurance that the breadth or degree of such protection will be sufficient to prohibit or otherwise delay the introduction of competitive products or technologies 
the introduction of competitive products and technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to adequately respond to changes in technology affecting the printing industry 
our continuing product development efforts have focused on refining and improving the performance of our pearl and di technology and our consumables and we anticipate that we will continue to focus such efforts 
the printing and publishing industry has been characterized in recent years by rapid and significant technological changes and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced products with features  which render our technologies  or products incorporating our technologies  obsolete or less marketable 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use leading technologies effectively  continue to develop our technical expertise and patented position  enhance our current products and develop new products that meet changing customer needs  time new product introductions in a way that minimizes the impact of customers delaying purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases  adjust the prices of our existing products to increase customer demand  successfully advertise and market our products  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
we must respond to changing technology and industry standards in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may not be successful in effectively using new technologies  developing new products or enhancing our existing products and technology on a timely basis 
our new technologies or enhancements may not achieve market 
table of contents acceptance 
our pursuit of new technologies may require substantial time and expense 
we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change 
these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept 
finally  we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge 
ongoing litigation could have an adverse impact on our business 
from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may be subject to lawsuits 
on september   presstek filed an action against fuji photo film corporation  ltd 
in the district court of mannheim  germany for patent infringement  alleging a disputed value tentatively estimated at  euros 
in this action  presstek alleges that fuji has manufactured and distributed a product that violates presstek european patent  registered under number de with the german patent and trademark office 
presstek seeks an order from the court that fuji refrain from offering the infringing product for sale  from using the infringing material or introducing it for the named purposes  or from possessing such infringing material 
also  in august  the company was served with a lawsuit filed on june  in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire against the company and two of its former officers  captioned james b 
zouras v 
robert hallman et al 
the lawsuit allegedly was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the company s common stock between december  and july  and alleges  among other things  that misstatements were made to the investing public regarding an arbitration proceeding commenced in and concluded in with one of the company s customers 
the complaint does not specify the amount of any damages being claimed 
the company disputes all material allegations of the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the litigation 
the loss or unavailability of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the success of presstek is largely dependent on the personal efforts of our senior management team 
we have recently entered into three year employment agreements with ed marino  our president and chief executive officer  and moosa e 
moosa  our chief financial officer 
the loss or interruption of the services of mr 
marino or mr 
moosa could have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 
our success may also be dependent on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified engineering  technical  sales  marketing and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel 
our stock price has been and could continue to be extremely volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations 
the securities markets  and the nasdaq national market in particular  have experienced  and are likely to experience in the future  significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements by us or other industry participants  changes in national or regional economic conditions  changes in securities analysts estimates for us  our competitors or our industry or our failure to meet analysts expectations  and general market conditions 
these factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities 
our long term borrowings are in variable rate instruments  with interest rates tied to either the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
a basis point change in these rates would have an impact of approximately  on our annual interest expense  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of the end of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into interest rate floors and caps to manage net exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to our borrowings 

table of contents we have some exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a limited number of our sales and purchase transactions are denominated in the european euro and the japanese yen 
in addition  some of our customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states 
as a result  these customers and strategic partners are themselves subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the united states dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  some of our suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency  versus that of the united states dollar  could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business
