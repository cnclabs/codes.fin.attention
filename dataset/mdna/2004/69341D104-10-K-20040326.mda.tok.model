item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require us to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following are some of the more material judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
a specific obsolescence allowance is provided for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory based on our best estimate of the net realizable value of inventory on hand 
historically  we have found our reserves to be adequate 
allowance for doubtful accounts for our accounts receivable  we continuously monitor collections from customers  our principal customer being edwards  and we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty and preventative maintenance costs we warranty our products against manufacturing defects under normal use and service during the warranty period 
we obtain similar warranties from a majority of our suppliers  including those who supply critical heart laser system components 
in addition  under the terms of our tmr distribution agreement with edwards  we are able to bill edwards for actual warranty costs  including preventative maintenance services  up to a specified amount during the warranty period 
we evaluate the estimated future unrecoverable costs of warranty and preventative maintenance services for our installed base of lasers on a quarterly basis and adjust our warranty reserve accordingly 
we consider all available evidence  including historical experience and information obtained from supplier audits 
in  based upon this experience  we determined that the rate of heart laser system failure and cost per failure were lower than previously expected 
as a consequence  during the third and fourth quarters of  we reduced our warranty accrual by approximately  in the third quarter of  we reduced the warranty accrual by approximately  revenue recognition we record revenue from the sale of tmr kits to edwards at the time of shipment 
lasers are billed to edwards in accordance with purchase orders we receive 
invoiced lasers are recorded as other current assets and deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet until such time as the laser is shipped to a hospital  at which time we record revenue and cost of revenue 
under the terms of the edwards tmr distribution agreement  once edwards has recovered a prescribed amount of revenue from a hospital for the use or purchase of a laser  any additional revenues earned by edwards are shared with us pursuant to a formula established in the distribution agreement 
we only record our share of such additional revenue  if any  at the time the revenue is earned 
we record revenue from the sale of tmr kits and lasers to international distributors or hospitals at the time of shipment 
prior to entering into the edwards tmr distribution agreement  we installed lasers in hospitals under placement contracts that did not transfer substantial ownership of the equipment to the customer 
revenues from these transactions are recognized over the life of the placement agreement in accordance with the specific terms of the contract 
revenues from service and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
installation revenues related to a laser transaction are recorded as a component of placement and service fees when the laser is installed 
results of operations results for the past three years and the related percent of revenues were as follows dollars in thousands total revenues total cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative research development income loss from operations other income liquidation of subsidiary foreign currency loss net income loss dollars in thousands increase decrease over increase decrease over product sales placement and service fees total revenues product cost of sales placement and service fees cost of sales total cost of revenues gross profit selling  general administrative expenses research development expenses total operating expenses liquidation of subsidiary foreign currency loss other income net income loss product sales laser revenues  the largest component of product sales  decreased by  in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a  decrease in domestic laser revenues  resulting from a decrease in the number of laser units sold 
this decrease was offset in part by a higher average domestic selling price on laser sales and increased revenue sharing earned under the distribution agreement with edwards 
international laser revenue increased by  due to one laser sale in disposable tmr kit revenues  the second largest component of product sales  increased by  in as compared to this increase is attributable to an increase in the number of tmr kits shipped to edwards 
royalty revenue  a component of product sales  decreased  in as compared to this decrease is due to a decline in the guaranteed minimum royalties due from cardiogenesis 
minimum royalties were in effect through june   but ceased thereafter 
although cardiogenesis is required to pay an ongoing royalty on actual sales of covered products after june   we expect that until such time  if ever  that cardiogenesis obtains fda approval for its pmr device  and provided that device remains a covered product under the terms of the license agreement  royalty revenue will be insignificant 
other product sales decreased  in laser revenues  the largest component of product sales  increased by  in as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to an  increase in domestic laser revenues 
the  increase in domestic laser revenues was due to an increase in the number of laser units sold  a higher average domestic selling price on laser sales and increased revenue sharing earned under the distribution agreement with edwards 
the  increase in domestic laser revenues was partially offset by a  decrease in revenue generated from international laser sales 
disposable tmr kit revenues  the second largest component of product sales  decreased by  in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the average domestic sales price of tmr kits sold to edwards 
this decrease in the average sales price of tmr kits sold to edwards took effect in january when edwards exercised a pre existing option to assume full sales and marketing responsibility for the hl and associated tmr kits in the us in connection with this option exercise by edwards  edwards retained an additional ten percentage points on revenue generated from us tmr kit sales 
royalty revenue  a component of product sales  decreased  in as compared to this decrease is due to a decline in the guaranteed minimum royalties due from cardiogenesis 
minimum royalties were in effect throughout all of  but only the first two quarters of other product sales decreased by  in placement and service fees placement fees declined  in as compared to approximately  of this  decline is attributable to a reduction in domestic placement fees 
the  reduction in domestic placement fees is in part the result of various us hl customers upgrading to the newer hl each upgrade results in a laser sale to edwards and a corresponding shift in recorded disposable tmr kit sales to these new hl customers which are recognized as product sales instead of placement fees 
the remaining  of the  decline was the result of lower international placement contract fees due to decreased kit shipments to international placement contract customers 
service fees increased  in as compared to due to more domestic lasers in service throughout  which resulted in increased billings to edwards for service contracts  installations and other service related calls 
placement fees declined  in as compared to approximately  of this  decline is attributable to a reduction in domestic placement fees 
the  reduction in domestic placement fees is in part the result of various us hl customers upgrading to the newer hl each upgrade results in a laser sale to edwards and a corresponding shift in recorded disposable tmr kit sales to these new hl customers which are recognized as product sales instead of placement fees 
the remaining  of the  decline was the result of lower international placement contract fees due to decreased kit shipments to international placement contract customers 
service fees increased  in as compared to due to more domestic lasers in service throughout  which resulted in increased billings to edwards for installation  warranty and preventative maintenance services 
gross profit total gross profit was  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with gross profit of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  the improvement in gross profit in as compared to is due to higher disposable tmr revenues  an increase in service related revenues and higher average selling price and additional shared revenue on laser transactions 
these increases were offset in part by lower royalty revenues from cardiogenesis a decrease in the number of laser sold  a  decrease in benefit derived from reducing our warranty accrual and reduced placement fees 
total gross profit was  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with gross profit of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  the improvement in gross profit in as compared to is due to a higher average selling price and additional shared revenue on laser transactions  manufacturing cost savings and improved product yields  lower depreciation charges  a  reduction in our warranty accrual and an increase in service related revenues 
these increases were offset in part by lower overall disposable tmr kit revenues  placement contract revenues and royalty revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses the overall decrease in as compared to is primarily a result of reduced expenditures related to compensation  related benefits  depreciation  telephone and general corporate expenditures 
the overall decrease in as compared to is primarily attributable to significantly reduced domestic sales and marketing expenditures as a result of the january exercise by edwards of a pre existing option to assume the us sales and marketing responsibility for the hl and all tmr kits  reduced international sales and marketing expenditures and reduced administrative expenditures 
research and development expenses the largest component of our research and development expenses in  and was the salaries and associated fringe benefits paid to our development staff 
the overall increase in as compared to is primarily related to consulting expenditures incurred in conjunction with our investigation and evaluation of new product development opportunities 
there were no significant changes in as compared to in any particular research and development expense related accounts  primarily because our development staffing levels remained unchanged 
we expect to incur significant new research and development expenditures in the future in pursuit of our business strategy to broaden and diversify our product portfolio beyond our current tmr offerings 
in particular  we expect our research and development expenditures to increase approximately million compared to as we attempt to complete the development of the optimaze system and advance certain other longer term research and development projects 
other income the largest component of other income is interest income earned on our cash balances 
in  interest income remained relatively consistent compared to in addition  other income was lower due to a reduction in foreign currency transaction gains realized in our international operations 
the decrease in as compared to was a result of both a lower overall average investable cash balance and lower interest rates earned on these invested funds 
liquidation of subsidiary foreign currency loss in  we decided to close our swiss subsidiary 
in closing that subsidiary  we realized a non recurring foreign currency translation loss of  in the year ended december  net income loss the increase in net income in as compared to resulted primarily from higher gross margin and lower operating expenses  offset by the non recurring foreign currency translation loss 
the net profit in as compared to a net loss in resulted primarily from higher gross margins and significantly reduced selling and marketing expenses as compared to there was no provision for income tax for the year ended december  or  despite a recorded net profit of  and  respectively  due to the utilization of us net operating loss carryforwards being available to reduce taxable income 
we expect to incur a net loss in  primarily as a result of our planned increased investments in research and development expenses  as discussed above 
kit shipments we view disposable kit shipments to end users by edwards as an important metric in evaluating our business 
we believe kit shipments  although not a direct measure  are a reasonable indicator for the adoption of tmr as a therapy in the marketplace 
disposable kit shipments to end users are as follows increase decrease over increase decrease over domestic international total management believes the increase in domestic kit shipments in both and is due primarily to an increase in the total number of installed lasers in the current year and lasers installed and available for only a portion of the prior year being available to hospitals for all of the current year to perform tmr procedures 
management believes the decline in international kit shipments in both and is primarily due to our limited efforts to drive procedural adoption in the international markets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and in february we received another  in a transaction with edwards see note in the consolidated financial statements 
we have no debt obligations 
during the year ended december   we generated  from operating activities 
cash used in investing activities was approximately  consisting of the purchase of equipment 
cash used for financing activities was approximately  primarily consisting of the net proceeds of  obtained from sales of our common stock offset by a  reduction in secured borrowings 
we believe that our existing cash resources will meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we are largely dependent on the success of edwards sales and marketing efforts in the us to continue to increase the installed base of hl lasers and substantially increase tmr procedural volumes and revenues 
should the installed base of hl lasers or tmr procedural volume not increase sufficiently  our liquidity and capital resources will be negatively impacted 
additionally  other unanticipated decreases in operating revenues or increases in expenses or further changes or delays in third party reimbursement to healthcare providers using our products may adversely impact our cash position and require further cost reductions or the need to obtain additional financing 
it is not certain that we  working with edwards and our international distributors  will be successful in achieving broad commercial acceptance of the heart laser systems  or that we will be able to operate profitably in the future on a consistent basis  if at all 
some hospital customers prefer to acquire the heart laser systems on a usage basis rather than as a capital equipment purchase 
we believe this is the result of limitations many hospitals currently have on acquiring expensive capital equipment as well as competitive pressures in the marketplace 
a usage business model may result in a longer recovery period for edwards to recoup its investment in lasers it purchases from us 
this could result in a delay in our ability to receive additional shared revenue  if any  that we otherwise are entitled to receive under the terms of our distribution agreement with edwards see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition and a delay in the purchase of new lasers by edwards if its installed base of placement lasers under usage contracts are under performing and it chooses to re deploy these lasers to other new hospital sites in lieu of purchasing a new laser from us 
our cash position and our need for additional financing to fund operations will be dependent in part upon the number of hospitals that acquire heart laser systems from edwards on a usage basis and the number and frequency of tmr procedures performed by these hospitals 
we cannot predict whether a usage based sales model will be successful  whether implemented by us or edwards 
furthermore  we have recently undertaken a new business strategy that involves broadening and diversifying our product portfolio beyond our current tmr offerings  by developing or acquiring new and innovative medical devices to address cardiac and vascular related markets 
we believe this strategy will result in our incurring losses for at least the next two years as we increase our investments in both manufacturing and research and development staff and capital equipment necessary to pursue these new strategic initiatives  including  but not limited to  the optimaze system 
we expect our capital expenditures to be in the range of  to  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in implementing our new business strategy or that future sales  if any  from these planned new products will recover the investments we plan to make 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our new business strategy our liquidity and capital resources will be adversely affected and we may need to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that  should we require additional financing  such financing will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
should additional financing not be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us  additional actions may be required that could adversely impact our ability to continue to realize assets and satisfy liabilities in the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of these uncertainties 
contractual obligations our long term contractual commitments consist of an operating lease for our facility in franklin  massachusetts that expires in august and purchase commitments to make payments to suppliers 
future annual minimum payments are as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements none 
certain factors that may affect our future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our company has a limited recent history of operating profits and we expect to incur significant operating losses in the near future we do not expect our recent limited history of operating profits  which began in the second quarter of  to continue in or for at least another twelve months thereafter 
we expect to increase our spending significantly in in the areas of manufacturing and research and development  as we increase our manufacturing capabilities and development staff to work on the optimaze system 
moreover  as we continue to pursue our new business strategy of acquiring or developing new medical devices to address cardiac and vascular related markets  we may continue to incur expenses that exceed the revenues we generate 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful with our new business strategy or that we will ever return to profitability 
our company is currently dependent on one principal product line to generate revenues we currently market one principal product line  which consists of two patented high powered carbon dioxide lasers and related tmr disposable kits known as the heart laser systems 
approximately and of our revenues in the years ended december  and december   respectively  were derived from the sales and service of our heart laser systems 
this absence of a diversified product line means that we are directly and materially impacted by changes in the market for heart laser systems 
our company is dependent on one principal customer pursuant to the terms of our amended tmr distribution agreement with edwards  edwards is our exclusive distributor for our hl and tmr kits in the united states 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of our new distribution agreement with edwards for the optimaze system as well as any other additional surgical products that we may develop for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter  edwards is our exclusive worldwide distributor of those products 
as a result of this relationship  edwards accounted for and of our total revenue in the years ended december  and december   respectively  and we expect edwards to account for the significant majority of our revenue in the future 
if our relationship with edwards does not progress as anticipated or if edwards sales and marketing strategies fail to generate sales of our products in the future  our revenue will decrease significantly and our business  financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
our company is dependent on certain suppliers some of the components for our heart laser systems  most notably the power supply and certain optics and fabricated parts for the hl  and certain components for the optimaze system  are only available from one supplier  and we have no assurance that we will be able to source any of our sole sourced components from additional suppliers 
we are dependent upon our sole suppliers to perform their obligations in a timely manner 
in the past  we have experienced delays in product delivery from our sole suppliers and  because we do not have an alternative supplier to produce these products for us  we have little leverage to enforce timely delivery 
any delay in product delivery or other interruption in supply from these suppliers could prevent us from meeting our commercial demands for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we do not require significant quantities of any components because we produce a limited number of our products each year 
our low quantity needs may not generate substantial revenue for our suppliers 
therefore  it may be difficult for us to continue our relationships with our current suppliers or establish relationships with additional suppliers on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and such difficulties may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must complete development of the optimaze system and be able to manufacture it in high volumes at commercially reasonable costs we must successfully complete development of the optimaze system 
we expect to outfit our facility with the necessary production and test equipment and train our employees on how to build the product 
this will include the need to manufacture highly specialized disposable handpieces for which we have no comparable prior experience producing at any volume 
until such time as we become more proficient in these manufacturing methods  if ever  we may encounter problems related to production yields  quality control  training  shortages of qualified personnel  and potential capacity constraints 
such problems could severely affect our ability to adequately scale up production and meet demand for our products on a timely basis  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon our key personnel and will need to hire additional key personnel in the near future our ability to operate our business successfully depends in significant part upon the retention and motivation of certain key technical  regulatory  production and managerial personnel and our ongoing ability to hire and retain additional qualified personnel in these areas 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the greater boston area 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract such personnel and the loss of any of our current key employees could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
our company may be unable to raise needed funds as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and in february we received another  in a transaction with edwards 
based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if our business does not progress in accordance with our current business plan  we may need to raise additional funds in the future 
we may not be able to raise additional capital upon satisfactory terms  or at all  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  ownership dilution to our stockholders will result 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the incurrence of debt  our activities may be restricted by the repayment obligations and other restrictive covenants related to the debt 
in order to compete effectively  our current and future products need to gain commercial acceptance tmr and surgical ablation for cardiac arrhythmias are still both emerging technologies 
our current and planned future products may never achieve widespread commercial acceptance 
to be successful  we need to demonstrate to the medical community in general  and to heart surgeons and cardiologists in particular  that tmr and surgical tissue ablation for cardiac arrhythmias are procedures that are effective  relatively safe and cost effective  support third party efforts to document the medical processes by which tmr procedures relieve angina and surgical tissue ablation cures cardiac arrhythmias  have more heart surgeons trained to perform tmr procedures using the heart laser systems and surgical tissue ablation procedures using the optimaze system  assuming the latter becomes commercially available in the future  and maintain third party reimbursement for both the tmr procedure and the use of surgical tissue ablation for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias 
to date  only a limited number of heart surgeons have been trained in the use of tmr  and we are dependent on edwards to expand related marketing and training efforts in the us for the use of our current and planned future products 
although the heart laser systems have received fda approval and the ce mark  they have not yet received widespread commercial acceptance 
in addition  although the optimaze system has received fda clearance  it has not yet secured the ce mark and it is not yet ready for widespread commercialization 
if we are unable to maintain regulatory clearances  secure the ce mark for the optimaze system or achieve widespread commercial acceptance of the heart laser systems or the optimaze system  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
our competitor in tmr may obtain fda approval to market a new device  the impact of which is uncertain on the future adoption rate of tmr our primary tmr competitor  cardiogenesis  is attempting to obtain fda approval to market their pmr laser  which would provide a less invasive method of creating channels in the heart 
if pmr can be shown to be safe and effective and is approved by the fda  it would eliminate the need in certain patients to make an incision in the chest  reducing costs and speeding recovery 
it is unclear what impact  if any  an approval of a pmr device would have on the future adoption rate for tmr procedures 
if pmr is approved  it could erode the potential tmr market which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological changes in our industry could make our products obsolete our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and intense competition 
new technologies and products and new industry standards will develop at a rapid pace  which could make our current and future planned products obsolete 
the advent of new devices and procedures and advances in new drugs and genetic engineering are especially threatening 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce product enhancements to address the needs of our customers 
material delays in introducing product enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our product and purchase those of our competitors 
many potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and are in a better financial position to exploit marketing and research and development opportunities 
in addition  we are aware that other companies are developing or already have developed proprietary systems for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias  and specifically af  that may be safer  clinically more effective  easier and more cost effective to use and  in the case of percutaneous devices  less invasive than the system we plan to develop 
we must receive and maintain government clearances or approvals in order to market our products our products and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive  rigorous and changing federal and state regulation in the us and to similar regulatory requirements in other major international markets  including the european union and japan 
these regulations and regulatory requirements are broad in scope and govern  among other things product design and development  product testing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance and approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
furthermore  regulatory authorities subject a marketed product  its manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities to continual review and periodic inspections 
we will be subject to ongoing fda requirements  including required submissions of safety and other post market information and reports  registration requirements  quality systems regulations  and recordkeeping requirements 
the quality systems regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
edwards  our distributor  depending on its activities  is also subject to certain requirements under the fdc act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  and state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of our products 
regulatory agencies may change existing requirements or adopt new requirements or policies that could affect our regulatory responsibilities or the regulatory responsibilities of a distributor like edwards 
we may be slow to adapt or may not be able to adapt to these changes or new requirements 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products  manufacturing processes  or our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement actions by the fda and other international regulatory authorities  including  but not limited to warning letters  patient or physician notification  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  voluntary or mandatory recalls  product seizures  refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit  refusal to permit the import or export of our products  fines  injunctions  suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals or clearances  and civil and criminal penalties 
should any of these enforcement actions occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
to date  we have received the following regulatory approvals for our products heart laser systems united states we received fda approval to market the hl heart laser system in august and the hl heart laser system in january however  although we have received fda approval  the fda has restricted the use of the heart laser systems by not allowing us to market these products to treat patients whose condition is amenable to conventional treatments  such as heart bypass surgery  stenting and angioplasty  and could impose additional restrictions or reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser systems at any time 
europe although we have the ability to market our heart laser system in the european union  individual members of the european union could  and france has  prohibited commercial use of the heart laser systems 
we received the ce mark from the european union for the hl and hl in march and february  respectively 
however the european union could impose additional restrictions or reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser systems at any time  and other european union countries could prohibit or restrict use of the heart laser systems 
japan we cannot market our product in japan until we receive government approval 
we believe that japan represents the largest potential market for the heart laser systems in asia 
prior to marketing the heart laser systems in japan  we must receive approval from the japanese government 
this approval requires a clinical study in japan with at least patients 
a study was completed in with the hl although the results of this study have been submitted to the japanese government  we do not know whether the clinical study will be sufficient or when  if ever  we will receive approval to sell the hl in japan 
in addition  it is unclear what impact the introduction of the hl into the us and other international markets will have on our ability to market the hl in japan 
optimaze system united states the fda has given clearance to the optimaze system under a k with indications for use as a surgical instrument for coagulation of soft tissue  including cardiac tissue  in conjunction with or without endoscopic equipment in the contact or non contact mode in open or closed surgical procedures 
however  as the optimaze system is still being developed  it is not yet deemed ready for commercial use in the us in addition  although we have received clearance from the fda only for the indications of use stated above  physicians  under the practice of medicine exception  may use the optimaze system in any manner they choose in treating an individual patient  including using the device to treat patients with af 
however  neither we nor edwards have conducted any clinical trials designed to obtain data to submit to the fda for the purpose of obtaining a specific indication for use of the optimaze system that would allow us to make claims or otherwise market this device for the treatment of af 
we are aware of at least one company which has indicated they have submitted data to the fda in support of a labeling claim that  if clearance is obtained  would allow them to market their device for the treatment of af 
in the event this company or other competitors are successful in obtaining specific indications for use for their devices in the treatment of af  our cardiac ablation products and specifically the optimaze system may be at a competitive marketing disadvantage until such time  if ever  that edwards conducts a clinical trial  submits sufficient data to the fda by means of a new k and obtains clearance to market the optimaze system for the treatment of af 
we cannot provide any assurance that edwards will ever conduct such a clinical trial or  if they do  that the data they obtain and submit to the fda will be sufficient for the fda to expand the current indications of use and provide clearance for the optimaze system to be marketed for the treatment of af 
also  we cannot assure you that even if such clearance is obtained  that it will be obtained in a timely enough fashion for our products to remain competitive in the marketplace 
europe once the optimaze system is fully developed in accordance with our internal design control processes and we deem it ready for human use  it nevertheless cannot be marketed in the eu until such time as it receives ce mark approval 
we need to complete and submit the relevant technical documentation to the appropriate certifying body in order to be able to apply the ce mark that  if granted  will enable the product to be distributed into the eu 
results of a recent study commissioned by the fda may affect reimbursement for our tmr procedure or result in other fda actions in november  the results of a tmr study commissioned by the fda were published in the journal of the american college of cardiology 
this study found that a certain number of patients who received tmr treatment did not meet the medical criteria for which it was approved 
we cannot assure you that medicare or private insurance companies might not review their reimbursement policies in light of this study and otherwise amend or eliminate reimbursement of the tmr procedure  and the fda will not require us to modify the labeling on the heart laser systems or take some other action as a result of this study  or that the demand for our products will not otherwise be affected 
should either of these actions occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
asserting and defending intellectual property rights may impact our results of operations in our industry  competitors often assert intellectual property infringement claims against one another 
the success of our business depends on our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property 
future litigation may have a material impact on our financial condition even if we are successful in marketing our products 
we may not be successful in defending or asserting our intellectual property rights 
an adverse outcome in any litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties 
in addition  a finding that any of our intellectual property is invalid could allow our competitors to more easily and cost effectively compete with us 
thus  an unfavorable outcome in any patent litigation or interference proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or interference proceeding could be substantial 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or interference proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and interference proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
we may be subject to product liability lawsuits  our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages we may be subject to product liability claims 
the united states supreme court has stated that compliance with fda regulations will not shield a company from common law negligent design claims or manufacturing and labeling claims based on state rules 
such claims may absorb significant management time and could degrade our reputation and the marketability of our products 
if product liability claims are made with respect to our products  we may need to recall the implicated product which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  although we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be sure that our insurance will be adequate to cover potential product liability lawsuits 
our insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims exceeds our insurance coverage  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations a portion of our product sales are generated from operations outside of the us establishing  maintaining and expanding international sales can be expensive 
managing and overseeing foreign operations may be difficult and products may not receive market acceptance 
risks of doing business outside the us include  but are not limited to  the following agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  us export licenses may be difficult to obtain  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
there can be no assurance that our international business will grow or that any of the foregoing risks will not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
because we are incorporated in canada  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us and our canadian directors under canadian law  you may not be able to enforce a judgment issued by courts in the us against us or our canadian directors 
the status of the law in canada is unclear as to whether a us citizen can enforce a judgment from a us court in canada for violations of us securities laws 
a separate suit may need to be brought directly in canada 
our stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future which may result in losses for our investors our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
some of the factors that can affect our stock price are the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated quarterly increases or decreases in revenue  gross margin or earnings  and changes in our business  operations  or prospects  speculation or actual news announcements in the media or industry trade journals about our company  our products  the tmr procedure or changes in reimbursement policies by medicare and or private insurance companies  announcements relating to strategic relationships or mergers  conditions or trends in the medical device industry  changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other medical device companies  and general market conditions or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance 
the market price of our stock may fall if shareholders sell their stock certain current shareholders hold large amounts of our restricted stock  which they could sell in the public market from time to time 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock within a short period of time could cause our stock price to fall 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock 
the value of your common stock may decrease if other security holders exercise their options and warrants as shown in the table below  as of march   we have reserved an additional  shares of common stock for future issuance upon exercise of outstanding options  warrants and shares purchasable under an employee stock purchase plan
