fluctuations in interest rates materially affect net interest income 
the accompanying graph analyzes these changes 
logo logo net interest income increased by million  or  in  compared to a increase and a decrease in and  respectively 
volume  rate and yield changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities contributed to the increase in net interest income 
average interest earning assets increased by million  or  in  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million 
volume changes of equal amounts in interest earning assets and interest bearing 
table of contents liabilities generally increase net interest income because of the spread between the yield on loans and investments and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in  average interest earning assets outgained average interest bearing liabilities by million  and while the continued declining interest rates had a relatively neutral effect on interest income  it had a more positive effect on lowering interest expense 
the bank s ability to produce net interest income is measured by a ratio called the interest margin 
the interest margin is net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
the interest margin was in compared to in and in interest margins are affected by several factors  one of which is the relationship of rate sensitive earning assets to rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
this factor determines the effect that fluctuating interest rates will have on net interest income 
rate sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are those which can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time 
the bank s objective in managing interest rate sensitivity is to achieve reasonable stability in the interest margin throughout interest rate cycles by maintaining the proper balance of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
for further analysis and discussion of interest rate sensitivity  refer to the subsequent section entitled liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management 
another factor that affects the interest margin is the interest rate spread 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
this measurement gives a more accurate representation of the effect market interest rate movements have on interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the average amount of the interest bearing liabilities as noted in the table  yields earned on average interest earning assets and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities  increased in  while the average rate of interest paid decreased from in to in average interest earning assets increased in  while the average yield on earning assets decreased from in to in the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities also affects the bank s interest margin 
the bank s earning assets are funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing demand deposits  and shareholders equity 
the net return on earning assets funded by non interest bearing demand deposits and shareholders equity exceeds the net return on earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
the bank maintains a relatively consistent percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is an expense used to establish the allowance for loan losses 
actual loan losses  net of recoveries  are charged directly to the allowance 
the expense recorded each year is a reflection of actual losses experienced during the year and management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance to absorb losses inherent to the portfolio 
charge offs exceeded recoveries by million during the year  a decrease of million over the prior year  and accordingly a provision of million was expensed for loan losses in  million in and million in the allowance is at of total loans outstanding at december   compared to in the decrease in charge offs net of recoveries was due to management s emphasis on collections during the year at both alc and the bank 
for additional information and discussion of the allowance for loan losses  refer to the section entitled loans and allowances for loan losses 
non interest income the following table presents the major components of non interest income for the years indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars service charges and other fees on deposit accounts credit insurance commissions and fees bank owned life insurance investment security gains  net other income non interest income consists of revenues generated by a broad range of financial services and activities  including fee based services and commissions earned through insurance sales and trading activities 
in addition  gains and losses from the sale of investment portfolio securities are included in non interest income 
total non interest income increased  or in this compares to an increase of in  and a decrease of in the increase can be attributed to the  or  increase in service and other 
table of contents charges on deposit accounts 
this increase in service charge income is due to the overdraft protection products and other daily fees  the new deposit accounts generated by the new banking offices as well as a renewed emphasis on increasing overall demand deposit accounts 
additionally  the increase of  or in other income in contributed to the increase in total non interest income 
the increase in other income was due to bank owned life insurance purchased in this insurance generated income of  in and  in non recurring items of non interest income include securities gains and losses 
investment securities had a net gain of  in compared to a  gain in and a  gain in income generated in the area of securities gains and losses is dependent on many factors including investment portfolio strategies  interest rate changes  and the short  intermediate  and long term outlook for the economy 
the bank organized a wholly owned subsidiary  fusb reinsurance  inc fusb reinsurance  in fusb reinsurance reinsures or underwrites credit life  credit accident and health insurance policies sold to the bank s consumer loan customers 
fusb reinsurance is responsible for the first level of risk on the policies up to a specified maximum amount  and the primary third party insurer retains the remaining risk 
as a result  more credit life insurance premiums and commissions are retained by the bank 
these premiums and commissions were  in   in and  in the bank entered into supplemental compensation benefit agreements with the directors and certain executive officers in the bank purchased bank owned life insurance policies used to fund those agreements 
the income recognized on these bank owned policies was  in and  in the bank continues to search for new sources of non interest income 
these sources will come from innovative ways of performing currently provided banking services as well as providing new services in the future 
fusb reinsurance is an example of this philosophy 
non interest expense the following table presents the major components of non interest expense for the years indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars compensation and benefits occupancy furniture and equipment impairment on limited partnerships legal  accounting and other professional fees stationary and supplies telephone communication advertising collection and recovery other total non interest expense efficiency ratio total non interest expense to average assets 
table of contents non interest expense consists primarily of four major categories salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  and other expense 
these expenses were positively impacted by the closing of three alc offices in and three offices in additionally  the bank opened one new branch office in each of and these events impacted the ratio of non interest expense to average assets  and the ratio remained stable during the period at  and in   and  respectively 
the efficiency ratio was computed by dividing total non interest expense by net interest income and non interest income 
an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same or greater volume of income while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources 
our efficiency ratio for was  compared to in and during total compensation and benefits increased approximately  or  in this increase is attributable to a combination of normal merit adjustments  the staffing of our new calera office in and the opening of our new tuscaloosa office in the increase of in was due to the calera office opening  and the decrease of in was due to the alc closures 
at december   the bank had full time equivalent employees compared to in and in the reduction in staff was accomplished by closing six alc offices during this three year period and managing attrition 
united security sponsors an employee stock ownership plan with k provisions 
the company made matching contributions totaling   and  in   and  respectively 
logo logo occupancy expense includes rents  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  insurance  taxes  and other expenses associated with maintaining eighteen banking offices and twenty six finance company offices 
the bank owns all banking offices  and all alc offices are leased 
net occupancy expense increased in  in  and in the increase in is due to the two new branch offices in calera and tuscaloosa 
furniture and equipment expense decreased in  compared to a decrease of in and a decrease of in the decrease in and relates to the alc office closures 
the bank invests in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects to receive tax benefits in the form of tax deductions from operating losses and tax credits 
the bank accounts for the investments under the equity method 
the investment balances in these partnerships were   and  at december   and  respectively 
losses amounted to   and  for   and  respectively 
management analyzes these investments annually for potential impairment 
during  legal  accounting and other professional fees increased  compared to increases of  for and  for this increase relates to ongoing projects and planning designed to improve efficiency  control and the 
table of contents enhancement of our risk management  as well as legal and accounting requirements for the stock split and the employee stock ownership plan with k provisions 
the increases in the stationary and supplies  telephone  and advertising expenses  as well as other expenses  were related to the new office openings 
financial condition united security s financial condition depends primarily on the quality and nature of the bank s assets  liabilities  and capital structure  the quality of its personnel  and prevailing market and economic conditions 
the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry  resulting in the need to increase equity capital at rates greater than the applicable inflation rate in order to maintain an appropriate equity to asset ratio 
also  the category of other expenses tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
the bank owns all of the stock of acceptance loan company  inc alc  an alabama corporation 
alc is a finance company with twenty six offices organized for the purpose of making consumer loans 
the bank is alc s only source of funds  which amounts to approximately million 
alc reported net income of million for the year ended december  this is an improvement over the million of net income in and a loss of million in management believes the most significant factor in producing quality financial results is the bank s ability to react properly and in a timely manner to changes in interest rates 
management  therefore  continues to maintain a more balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations 
provision for income taxes united security s provision for income taxes increased in this increase was caused  in part  by a increase in income before taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates for   and were   and  respectively 
note to the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the provision for income taxes 
management s determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income earned by subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries may be able to generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
however  a portion of the amount of the deferred tax asset that can be realized in any year is subject to certain statutory federal income tax limitations 
because of these uncertainties  a valuation allowance has been established 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax asset and  if necessary  records a valuation allowance accordingly 

table of contents loans and allowance for loan loss total loans outstanding increased by million in with million outstanding at year end 
loans represent of the company s earning assets and provide of interest income 
real estate loans make up of total gross loans at year end  up from last year 
these loans consist of construction loans to both businesses and individuals on residential and commercial development  commercial buildings and apartment complexes  with most of this activity being commercial 
real estate loans also consist of other loans secured by real estate  such as one to four family dwellings  including mobile homes  loans on land only  multi family dwellings  non farm non residential real estate and home equity loans 
commercial loans totaled million at year end these loans decreased million or from year end to year end this decrease over the past year is due to an uncertain economy and several large line payoffs 
consumer loans are the second largest group of loans which represents of total loans outstanding 
they amount to million at year end  a increase from these loans include loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures  including credit cards and other related credit plans 
of these loans are originated at alc 
consumer loans at alc increased from to  all of which is attributed to normal growth in existing offices 
consumer loans at the bank grew million  or  from year end to logo the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level  which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  including the nature of the portfolio and changes in its risk profile  credit concentrations  historical trends  and economic conditions 
this evaluation also considers the balance of impaired loans 
losses on individually identified impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s original effective market interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded through the provision added to the allowance for loan losses 
one to four family residential mortgages and consumer installment loans are subjected to a collective evaluation for impairment  considering delinquency and repossession statistics  historical loss experience  and other factors 
though management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate  ultimate losses may vary from their estimates 
however  estimates are reviewed periodically  and as adjustments become necessary they are reported in earnings during periods they become known 
the bank s loan policy requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant doubt exists as to the repayment of the principal balance of a loan 
consumer installment loans at the bank and alc are generally recognized as losses if they become days and days delinquent  respectively 
the only exception to this policy occurs when the underlying value of the collateral or the customer s financial position makes a loss unlikely 
a credit review of the bank s individual loans is conducted periodically by branch and by loan officer 
a risk rating is assigned to each loan and is reviewed at least annually 
in assigning risk  management takes into consideration the capacity of the borrower to repay  collateral values  current economic conditions and other factors 
loan officers and other personnel handling loan transactions undergo frequent training dedicated to improving the credit quality as well as the yield of the loan portfolio 
the bank utilizes a written loan policy  which attempts to guide lending personnel in maintaining consistent underwriting standards 
this policy is intended to aid loan officers and lending personnel in making sound credit decisions and to assure compliance with state and federal regulations 

table of contents in order to better manage credit risk  alc carefully oversees its portfolio through formal underwriting standards  monitoring of customer payments and active follow up 
alc assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on an aggregate level based upon recent delinquency status and estimates of inherent loss from historical experience within these portfolios 
alc continues to concentrate more on loans secured by real estate and places less emphasis on automobile loans 
the following table shows the company s loan distribution as of december      and december  in thousands of dollars commercial  financial and agricultural real estate installment consumer less unearned interest  commissions fees total the amounts of total loans excluding installment loans outstanding at december   which  based on the remaining scheduled repayments of principal  are due in one year or less  more than one year but within five years  and more than five years  are shown in the following table 
maturing within one year after one but within five years after five years total in thousands of dollars commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate mortgage total variable rate loans totaled approximately million and are included in the one year category 
the bank and alc ended the year with an allowance for loan losses of million  an increase of million from december  total loans charged off in totaled million 
recoveries on loans previously charged off totaled million  resulting in net charge offs of million 
net charge offs for totaled million 
management charged to operations million in as an addition to the allowance for loan losses 
this compares to million charged to operations for and million for of the net charge offs of million  million represents charge offs from alc loans and million from the bank 
net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from in to in non performing assets the following table presents information on non performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
december  in thousands of dollars non performing assets loans accounted for on a non accrual basis accruing loans past due days or more real estate acquired in settlement of loans total non performing assets as a percent of net loans and other real estate 
table of contents accruing loans past due days or more at december   totaled  these loans are secured  and  taking into consideration the collateral value and the financial strength of the borrowers  management believes there will be no loss in these accounts and allowed the loans to continue accruing 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that were considered impaired was  compared to  at december  all such loans were on a non accrual basis at december   however  at december   the one loan considered impaired was restructured and has improved to the point accrual of interest has resumed 
there was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  in the allowance for loan losses specifically allocated to these loans 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately  and  at years ended december  and  respectively 
non performing assets as a percentage of net loans and other real estate was at december  this decrease from at december   represents the emphasis placed on reducing non performing assets during the year 
management reviews these loans and reports to the board of directors monthly 
management set a goal to maintain this category at or lower during loans past due days or more and still accruing are reviewed closely by management and are allowed to continue accruing only when underlying collateral values and management s belief that the financial strength of the borrowers is sufficient to protect the bank from loss 
if at any time management determines there may be a loss of interest or principal  these loans will be changed to non accrual and their asset value downgraded 
the bank discontinues the accrual of interest on a loan when management has reason to believe the financial condition of the borrower has deteriorated so that the collection of interest is in doubt 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against current income unless the collateral securing the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest 
interest received on non accrual loans is generally either applied against the principal or recognized on a cash basis  according to management s judgment as to whether the borrower can ultimately repay the loan 
a loan may be restored to accrual status if the obligation is brought current  performs in accordance with the contract for a reasonable period  and if management determines that the repayment of the total debt is no longer in doubt 
summarized below is information concerning the income on those loans with deferred interest or principal payments resulting from deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower 
december  in thousands of dollars total loans accounted for on a non accrual basis interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income reported and recorded during the year at december  non accrual loans totaled million or of loans  compared to million or of loans at december  this decrease in non accrual loans at december   represents management s emphasis on loan quality and underwriting at both alc and the bank 
one large line was charged against the bank s loan loss reserve during the year  and one was moved to other real estate through foreclosure 
the majority of the loans remaining in this category are in the process of liquidation or management has commitments from the principals involved for reduction during the year 
underlying collateral values support those loans which are not already in liquidation 
management continues to emphasize asset quality and believes that at december   it has adequate reserves for losses inherent in this portion of the portfolio although no assurances can be given to this effect because ultimate losses may vary from management s estimates 
lending officers and other personnel involved in the lending process receive ongoing training in compliance as well as asset quality 
the bank has no foreign loans 
the bank does not make loans on commercial property outside its market area without prior approval of the board of directors or the directors loan committee

smaller non accrual and adversely classified loans are assigned a portion of the allowance based on loan grading 
smaller past due loans are assigned a portion of the allowance using a formula that is based on the severity of the delinquency 
the remainder of the portfolio is also allocated a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and the economic conditions for the particular loan portfolio 
allocation weights are assigned based on the bank s historical loan loss experience in each category  although a higher allocation weight may be used if current conditions indicate that the loan losses may exceed historical experience 
while the total allowance is described as consisting of the portions described above  all portions are available to support inherent losses in the loan portfolio

there are several major paper mills in our trade area including the alabama river companies  boise cascade  georgia pacific and weyerhauser 
in addition  there are several sawmills  lumber companies  and pole and piling producers 
the table below shows the dollar amount of loans made to timber and timber related companies as of december  the amount of timber related loans decreased from million in to million in the percentage of timber related loans to gross loans decreased from in to in timber related loans total gross loans percentage of total loans million million management realizes that the bank is reasonably dependent on the economic health of the timber related industries 
accordingly  this represents a concentration of loans in timber and timber related industries 
we continue to feel these risks are reduced by the diversification of product production within these industries 
some of the mills and industries specialize in paper and pulp  some in lumber and plywood  some in poles and pilings  and others in wood and veneer 
we do not believe that this concentration is excessive or that it represents a trend which might materially impact future earnings  liquidity  or capital resources of the company 
historically  the company has benefited from the industries engaged in the growing  harvesting  processing and marketing of timber and timber related products 

table of contents investments in limited partnerships the bank invests in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects to receive tax benefits in the form of tax deductions from operating losses and tax credits 
the bank accounts for the investments under the equity method 
the bank s interest in these partnerships was million and million for and  respectively 
decreases to earnings associated with the partnerships carried under the equity method amounted to approximately   and  for   and  respectively 
management analyzes these investments annually for impairment 
the assets and liabilities of these partnerships consist primarily of apartment complexes and related mortgages 
the bank s carrying value approximates its underlying equity in the net assets of the partnerships 
the bank had no remaining cash commitments to these partnerships at december  although these investments are considered non earning assets  they do contribute to the bottom line in the form of federal income tax credits 
these credits amounted to approximately  in and are estimated to be approximately  for also  operating losses related to these partnerships are available as deductions for taxes on the bank s books 
investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments investment securities available for sale included million government and agency securities  mortgage backed securities of million  state  county and municipal securities of million  and other securities of million 
the securities portfolio is carried at fair market value  and it increased million from december   to december  at december   approximately million in collateral mortgage obligations cmo held by the bank had floating interest rates which reprice monthly  and million had fixed interest rates 
because of their liquidity  credit quality and yield characteristics  the majority of the purchases of taxable securities have been purchases of agency guaranteed mortgage backed obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the mortgage backed obligations in which the bank invests represent an undivided interest in a pool of residential mortgages or may be collateralized by a pool of residential mortgages mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities have yield and maturity characteristics corresponding to the underlying mortgages and are subject to principal prepayment  refinancing  or foreclosure of the underlying mortgages 
although maturities of the underlying mortgage loans may range up to years  scheduled principal and normal prepayments substantially shorten the effective maturities 
as of december   the investment portfolio had an estimated average effective maturity of years 
interest rate risk contained in the overall securities portfolio is formally monitored on a monthly basis 
management assesses each month how risk levels in the investment portfolio affect overall company wide interest rate risk 
expected changes in forecasted yield  earnings and market value of the bond portfolio are generally attributable to fluctuations in interest rates  as well as volatility caused by general uncertainty over the economy  inflation  and future interest rate trends 
mortgage backed securities and cmos present some degree of additional risk in that mortgages collateralizing these securities can be refinanced  thereby affecting the future yield and market value of the portfolio 
the composition of the bank s investment portfolio reflects the bank s investment strategy of maximizing portfolio yields commensurate with risk and liquidity considerations 
the primary objectives of the bank s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the bank s interest rate position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
fair market values of securities can vary significantly as interest rates change 
the gross unrealized gains and losses logo 
table of contents in the securities portfolio are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity or other funding needs 
there were net unrealized gains  net of taxes  of million in the securities portfolio on december   versus net unrealized gains  net of taxes  of million one year ago

these include interest rate swaps and caps 
the use and detail regarding these products are fully discussed under liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bank adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  effective january   as required by the financial accounting standards board 
on that date  the bank reassessed and designated derivative instruments used for risk management as fair value hedges  cash flow hedges and derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  as appropriate 
on december   the bank had interest rate derivatives with a notional value of million 
in conjunction with fasb  the bank recorded a negative  net of taxes  to other comprehensive income to reflect the fair value of such instruments as of that date

table of contents shareholders equity united security has always placed great emphasis on maintaining its strong capital base 
at december   shareholders equity totaled million  or of total assets compared to and for year end and  respectively 
this level of equity indicates to united security s shareholders  customers and regulators that united security is financially sound and offers the ability to sustain an appropriate degree of leverage to provide a desirable level of profitability and growth 
over the last three years shareholders equity grew from million at the beginning of to million at the end of this growth was the result of internally generated retained earnings  with the exception of approximately  from stock options being exercised over the last three years 
shareholders equity was also impacted by the net change in unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale and derivatives  net of tax 
this adjustment increased shareholders equity by  in and  in  and decreased shareholders equity by  in a significant impact on shareholders equity over the last three years was the stock repurchase plan united security initiated in may of at year end a total of  shares were repurchased as treasury stock reducing shareholders equity by million 
during  an additional  shares were repurchased to reduce equity by an additional million 
there were no shares repurchased in logo while the stock repurchase plan reduced total shareholders equity in and  united security s capital base remains a source of strength as noted above  and the internal capital generation rate net income less cash dividends as a percentage of average shareholders equity remains favorable at in  in and in the two for one stock split authorized and implemented in increased common stock to an average of million shares outstanding  however  total shareholders equity was not affected by the split 
all shares outstanding and dividend per share numbers recorded in prior years have been adjusted as a result of the stock split 
united security is required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure  and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each with a specified risk weighting factor 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the banking regulatory agencies have also adopted regulations which supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum leverage ratio of of tier capital as defined below to total assets less goodwill the leverage ratio 
depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors  the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of or higher than the minimum level 
the minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
at least of that capital level must consist of common equity  undivided profits  and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt  and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier ii capital is total risk based capital 

table of contents the following chart summarizes the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
united security s capital ratios at december   substantially exceeded all regulatory requirements 
risk based capital requirements minimum regulatory requirements united security s ratio at december  total capital to risk adjusted assets tier i capital to risk adjusted assets tier i leverage ratio total capital also has an important effect on the amount of fdic insurance premiums paid 
lower capital ratios can cause the rates paid for fdic insurance to increase 
united security plans to maintain the capital necessary to keep fdic insurance rates at a minimum

table of contents ratio analysis the following table presents operating and equity performance ratios for each of the last three years 
year ended december  return on average assets return on average equity cash dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets ratio liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the primary function of asset and liability management is to assure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet day to day cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the bank would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
interest rate risk management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management ensures that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable time frame  thereby minimizing the effect of such interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily from loan principal payments and maturities and through sales  maturities  and principal payments from the investment portfolio 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold are additional sources of liquidity 
loans maturing or repricing in one year or less amounted to million at december  investment securities maturing or repricing in the same time frame totaled million or of the investment portfolio at year end in addition  principal payments on mortgage backed securities and cmos totaled million in the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  short term and long term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity 
liquidity management involves the continual monitoring of the sources and uses of funds to maintain an acceptable cash position 
long term liquidity management focuses on considerations related to the total balance sheet structure 
although the majority of the securities portfolio has stated maturities longer than years  the entire portfolio consists of securities that are readily marketable and easily convertible into cash 
as of december   the bond portfolio had an expected average maturity of years  and approximately of the million in bonds were expected to be repaid within years 
however  management does not rely solely upon the investment portfolio to generate cash flows to fund loans  capital expenditures  dividends  debt repayment  and other cash requirements 
instead  these activities are funded by cash flows from operating activities and increases in deposits and short term borrowings 
the bank  at december   had long term debt and short term borrowings that  on average  represent of total liabilities and equity 
the bank currently has up to million in additional borrowing capacity from the federal home loan bank and million in established federal funds lines 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames during which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to changes in interest rates  either at replacement or maturity  during the life of the instruments 
sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volume of assets and the volume of liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
these differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps and are usually calculated for segments of time and on a cumulative basis 

table of contents changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus affecting net interest income 
it should be noted  therefore  that a matched interest sensitive position by itself will not ensure maximum net interest income 
management continually evaluates the condition of the economy  the pattern of market interest rates  and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities 
using this analysis  management from time to time assumes calculated interest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in general levels of interest rates 
measuring interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is a technique used to measure interest rate sensitivity at a particular point in time  an example of which is presented below 
assets and liabilities are placed in gap intervals based on their repricing dates 
assets and liabilities for which no specific repricing dates exist are placed in gap intervals based on management s judgment concerning their most likely repricing behaviors 
derivatives used in interest rate sensitivity management are also included in the applicable gap intervals 
a net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilities repricing in that interval from the assets repricing 
a positive gap more assets repricing than liabilities will benefit net interest income if rates are rising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment 
conversely  a negative gap more liabilities repricing than assets will benefit net interest income in a declining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
gap analysis is the simplest representation of the bank s interest rate sensitivity 
however  it cannot reveal the impact of factors such as administered rates  pricing strategies on consumer and business deposits  changes in balance sheet mix  or the effect of various options embedded in balance sheet instruments 
the accompanying table shows the bank s rate sensitive position at december   as measured by gap analysis 
over the next months approximately million more interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets can be repriced to current market rates at least once 
this analysis indicated that the bank has a negative gap within the next month range

table of contents management s adjustments reflect the bank s anticipated repricing sensitivity of non maturity deposit products 
historically  balances on non maturity deposit accounts have remained relatively stable despite changes in market interest rates 
management has classified certain of these accounts as non rate sensitive based on management s historical pricing practices and runoff experience 
certain interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included in the table based on historical repricing experience and expected prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities rather than contractual maturities 
non accruing loans are included in loans at the contractual maturity 
the bank uses additional tools to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
these include net interest income and margin simulation analysis as well as forecasting changes in the market value of equity 
both analyses are methods of estimating earnings and capital at risk under varying interest rate conditions 
these measures incorporate adjustments for changes in the timing of asset liability and cash flows and capture adjustments for the lag between movements in market interest rates and the movements of administered rates on prime rate loans  interest bearing transaction accounts  regular savings  and money market savings accounts 
income simulation analysis indicates that the bank is slightly exposed to both increases and decreases in interest rates 
the following table demonstrates the expected effect a given parallel interest rate shift would have on net interest income over a two year period 
change in interest rates in basis points change in net interest income change in net interest income in thousands

the bank follows a uniform process to calculate the duration of each asset and liability category 
the first step is to assemble maturity and repricing data for categories of loans  investments  cds and other financial instruments with contractual maturities 
the second step is to determine how bank management  where appropriate  would alter the interest rate for each category of assets and liabilities assuming market interest rates rose or fell or 
the third step is to combine the maturity analysis and repricing assumptions in order to estimate modified duration for each category 
the fourth step is to calculate a weighted average for total assets and liabilities  and the fifth step is to multiply the calculated modified duration difference for both up and down interest rate scenarios in step four by total assets 
based on the current position of the balance sheet  management believes these estimates reflect how the market value of each asset and liability would change as interest rates change  and in total  reflect the changes in market values of equity 
in this methodology  all non rate sensitive assets and liabilities are assigned a modified duration equal to years 
additionally  estimates of modified duration incorporate the likelihood that some assets and liabilities would change maturities as interest rates change 
this method also incorporates management s belief that deposit and loan rates would not rise or fall equally either by category or by interest rate scenario 
there is no allowance for growth or runoff in deposit or loan balances 
the analysis of market value of equity presented above suggests that the bank s earnings should decrease slightly if interest rates rise and should increase slightly if interest rates fall over the five year time horizon 

table of contents as part of the ongoing monitoring of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  the bank enters into various interest rate contracts interest rate protection contracts to help manage the bank s interest sensitivity 
these contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include i interest rate swaps where the bank typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index and ii interest rate caps and floors purchased where the bank receives interest if the specified index falls below the floor rate or rises above the cap rate 
all interest rate swaps represent end user activities and are designed as hedges 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the overall interest management strategy and the company s interest risk management program 
the income or expense associated with interest rate swaps  caps  and floors classified as hedges are ultimately reflected as adjustments to interest income or expense 
changes in the estimated market value of interest rate protection contracts are reflected in either the bank s income statement or balance sheet 
a discussion of interest rate risks  credit risks and concentrations in derivative instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commitments the bank maintains financial instruments with risk exposure not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these financial instruments are executed in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and in connection with its investing and trading activities 
these financial instruments include commitments to make loans  standby letters of credit  and commitments to purchase securities for forward delivery 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank applies the same credit policy in making these commitments that it uses for on balance sheet items 
collateral obtained upon exercise of the commitment is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower and may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  land  and other items 
the bank normally does not require collateral for standby letters of credit 
as of december   the bank had outstanding standby letters of credit and commitments to make loans of  and million  respectively 
the bank is prepared to fulfill the above commitments through scheduled maturities of loans and securities along with cash flows from operations  anticipated growth in deposits  and short term borrowings
