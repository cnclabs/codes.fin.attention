item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s mission is to commercialize the use of carbon fibers as a low cost but high performance reinforcement for composites used as the primary building material in everyday commercial products 
the company has developed and is implementing a strategy to manufacture and sell carbon fibers into commercial applications at costs competitive with other materials 
in addition  through its technical fibers segment the company is the leading supplier of carbon fibers to the aircraft brake industry  and manufactures and markets oxidized acrylic fibers  an intermediate product of the carbon fiber manufacturing process  for fire and heat resistance applications 
the company introduced its carbon fibers strategic plan in to develop a low cost process to produce carbon fibers and build significant capacity while encouraging growth of new applications 
as part of its strategy to establish availability of carbon fibers on a scale sufficient to encourage growth of large volume applications  the company completed a major carbon fiber production capacity expansion in fiscal at its abilene  texas facility 
while the company succeeded in developing its infrastructure to become the low cost producer  the large volume applications were slower to develop than anticipated 
from to mid total carbon fiber usage did not grow significantly and aerospace applications actually declined 
this situation resulted in substantial overcapacity and destructive pricing in the industry 
much of the new carbon fiber business was captured by the aerospace fibers as certain manufacturers sold their aerospace grade fibers on the commercial markets at prices that did not cover their costs  undermining the company s commercialization strategy 
the carbon fiber market conditions began to change during the second quarter of fiscal two major aerospace programs  the airbus a and the boeing e  have absorbed virtually all of the aerospace fiber capacity  and resulted in the divergence of the aerospace and commercial markets for carbon fibers 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company has entered into several significant supply relationships with carbon fibers customers 
increases in sales of carbon fiber products in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal confirmed this shift 
the divergence of the two markets was accelerated by the strength in the development of the carbon fiber wind turbine blade market 
currently zoltek believes it is in a unique position of having installed capacity and fiber quality that can attract current available and future new business 
the recent increase in the demand for carbon fibers relates to several different applications including aerospace 
during fiscal  the company experienced growth in customer demand in the carbon and technical fiber business units  as sales excluding inter segment sales increased million and million  respectively  over fiscal the improved sales in the carbon fibers and technical fibers business units resulted in a reduction in the overall operating loss from continuing operations reported by the company from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the company has specifically targeted three significant and emerging applications wind energy  flame retardant bedding and home furnishings  and automotive 
development of the use of carbon fibers is continuing in each of these targeted market segments 
with the new orders in place and indications for additional significant orders  the company has restarted its major carbon fiber manufacturing facility in abilene  texas which had been temporarily idled 
the company has begun operation of manufacturing lines with aggregate rated capacity of million pounds per year and expects to begin operation of additional manufacturing lines with aggregate rated capacity of million pounds per year by the end of fiscal the hungarian carbon fiber manufacturing facility currently is operating at full capacity 
maintaining the excess capacity has been costly  but the company believed it has been necessary to assure customers of adequate supply and encourage them to shift to carbon fibers from other materials 
with the reactivation of the abilene plant  unused capacity costs are expected to diminish and  ultimately  be fully absorbed in ongoing production as all the carbon fiber lines start operating in fiscal in order to meet demand for carbon fibers for wind energy and other commercial carbon fiber applications  zoltek has undertaken a three phase capacity expansion program 
first  zoltek has initiated the start up of the five installed lines at its abilene  texas facility and activated sufficient precursor capacity to support all of the company s carbon fiber capacity  which are scheduled to be fully operational in the first half of fiscal second  zoltek plans to add two new carbon fiber lines and add sufficient precursor capacity at the company s hungarian facility by the end of fiscal the third phase of the expansion program calls for a doubling of the carbon fiber and precursor capacity levels after the second phase  to be operational in outside of the carbon fiber business  the company sells acrylic and nylon fibers into textile markets and manufactures other specialty products in its hungary facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company discontinued the nylon fiber operation and the acrylic textile business 
these divisions were deemed not to be part of the long term strategy of the company and not expected to be profitable in the foreseeable future due to the continued pricing pressure from competitive manufacturers 
the company will utilize a portion of the acrylic fiber capacity to supply precursor for its growing carbon fiber manufacturing operations 
the company recorded a one time charge to earnings of million related to severance 
the results from operations of these two divisions has been reclassified to discontinued operations for fiscal  and results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september the company s sales increased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to increases in carbon fiber sales excluding intersegment and technical fiber sales excluding intersegment 
carbon fiber sales excluding intersegment increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in carbon fiber sales in fiscal was achieved despite a decrease of million from related to the company s decision to relocate its prepreg operations from california to utah to reduce costs by combining its operations with another of the company s facilities 
other carbon fibers sales increased by million in fiscal from fiscal as production and sales of sporting goods and wind energy orders continued during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the company experienced a strong increase in the overall demand for carbon fiber over prior years 
technical fiber sales excluding intersegment increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal technical fiber sales increased as demand improved not only in the aircraft brake customers but also for the flame retardant market 
sales of the specialty products business segment decreased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company discontinued the nylon fiber operation and the acrylic textile business 
the company will utilize a limited portion of the acrylic fiber capacity to supply precursor for its growing carbon fiber manufacturing operations 
the results from operations of these two divisions have been reclassified to discontinued operations for fiscal  and the remaining specialty products division sales have remained flat from fiscal to  however  the divisions remained profitable at these levels 
the company s cost of sales excluding available unused capacity costs increased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon and technical fiber cost of sales excluding intersegment increased by or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as sales of carbon and technical fiber excluding intersegment increased for the year 
the increase of compared to an increase of in sales results from the company s ability to absorb its fixed cost as manufacturing activities increased 
the cost of sales of the company s specialty products business segment increased compared to the decrease in sales  reflecting sales mix factors 
the company continued to incur costs related to the underutilized productive capacity for carbon fibers at the abilene  texas facility  including depreciation and other overhead associated with the unused capacity 
these costs  which were separately identified on the statement of operations  were approximately million during fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in was due to the start up of the carbon fiber lines in abilene during the fourth quarter of the company believes it has been necessary to maintain available capacity to encourage development of significant new large scale applications 
with the increased orders in fiscal  unused capacity costs are expected to continue to decrease significantly during that period and to be fully absorbed in ongoing operations by the end of fiscal as all installed production lines began operating 
see additional discussion of the abilene facility under liquidity and capital resources 
application and market development costs were million in fiscal and million in fiscal as the company continued cost containment measures implemented in related to personnel involved in research and development 
these costs included product and market development efforts  product trials and sales and product development personnel and related travel 
targeted emerging applications include automobile components  fire heat barrier and alternate energy technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal although sales for the year increased and carbon fiber sales increased the company has continued cost containment measures related to personnel in non operations departments implemented during fiscal operating loss from continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal  an improvement of million 
carbon fiber operating loss improved from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal the operating income in technical fibers increased from income of million in fiscal to million in fiscal corporate headquarters operating loss decreased with a loss of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal specialty product operating loss decreased from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal the decrease in the company s total operating loss was a result of the significant improvement in the carbon fibers and technical fibers business units as sales and production have increased to absorb fixed manufacturing cost and the continued reduction of operating expenses due to the cost containment measures implemented during interest expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest resulted from higher debt levels after the company s refinancing transactions see liquidity and capital resources 
the company experienced little fluctuation attributed to changes in interest rates as a substantial portion of the debt portfolio consists of fixed rate 
amortization of debt discount from warrants  deferred financing and beneficial conversion feature costs  which are non cash expenses  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in amortization resulted from the company s refinancing transactions see liquidity and capital resources 
other income expense  net  was immaterial in fiscal and fiscal income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to an income tax expense of million for fiscal a valuation allowance was recorded against the income tax benefit resulting from the pre tax loss in both fiscal and due to uncertainties in the company s ability to utilize tax losses in the future 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million for fiscal similarly  the company reported a net loss per share from continuing operations of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding were million for fiscal and million for fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to discontinue and exit two divisions of its zoltek rt 
operations which manufacture acrylic and nylon fibers and yarns 
these divisions are not part of the long term strategy of the company and will not be profitable in the foreseeable future due to the continued pricing pressure from competitive manufacturers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment loss on discontinued operations of million compared to zero in the operating loss related to those divisions were million for the fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the increase in the operating loss was due to sales decreasing by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal while cost of sales only decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as the company did not decrease its fixed cost component of cost of sales at a rate equal to its drop in sales 
the company also recorded a loss of million related to a legal judgment involving the company s former hardcore subsidiary 
the company is vigorously defending this matter and has filed counterclaims and an appeal 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
comparison of results for fiscal years ended september  and the company s sales decreased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal technical fiber sales decreased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber sales excluding intersegment increased  or million  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber sales increased both in hungary and the us as the demand for carbon fiber increased in the second half of the year as excess capacity in the industry started to decrease 
during fiscal  technical fibers decreased due to excess technical fiber capacity that weakened economic conditions globally specifically in the aerospace business 
sales of other products produced at zoltek rt 
increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as sales of the mavibond division increased due to higher demand from eastern european customers 
the company s cost of sales excluding available unused capacity costs decreased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales excluding available unused capacity costs was consistent with the decrease in sales  however  not to the degree of the sales decline due to the technical fiber having been impacted from industry wide excess capacity that resulted in distressed pricing across most existing markets and lower sales volume that have not supported the level of the company s fixed manufacturing cost 
the company also recorded a reserve of million for certain carbon fiber inventories of which it was deemed to have excess amounts in fiscal in fiscal  the company continued to incur costs related to the underutilized productive capacity for carbon fibers at the abilene  texas facilities 
these costs included depreciation and other overhead associated with the unused capacity 
these costs  which were separately identified on the income statement  were approximately million during fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease relates to the continued cost containment measures related to personnel implemented during fiscal application and market development costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing a million decrease 
this decrease was due to cost containment measures 
the costs incurred in fiscal related to the carbon fiber operations for product and market development efforts for product trials  and for additional sales and product development personnel and travel 
targeted emerging applications included automobile manufacturing  alternate energy technologies  deep sea oil drilling  filament winding and buoyancy 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in expense was from both business segments and the corporate headquarters  due to cost cutting measures  including lower payroll 
interest expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase resulted from higher debt levels after the company s refinancing transactions see liquidity and capital resources 
the company experienced little fluctuation attributed to changes in interest rates as a substantial portion of the debt portfolio consists of fixed rate 
other income expense  net  increased million to million expense for fiscal from million income for fiscal due to an increase in the foreign currency transactional losses on the company s debt at its hungarian subsidiary which is denominated in u 
s dollars or euros 
income tax expense increased million to million for fiscal from an income tax benefit of million for the corresponding period in the prior year 
a valuation allowance was recorded against the income tax benefit resulting from the pre tax loss for fiscal and due to uncertainties in the company s ability to utilize tax losses in the future 
during fiscal  the tax laws changed allowing the company additional carryback of net operating loss to prior years resulting in a tax benefit in the statement of operations 
the loss from discontinued operations related to the acrylic fiber operations increased from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal the increase in the loss in fiscal was due to the decrease in sales related to continuing pricing pressures from competitors without a corresponding reduction in manufacturing cost 
the loss in was offset by a gain of million related to the sale of the company s former hardcore subsidiary 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million for fiscal similarly  the company reported net loss from continuing operations per share of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding were million for fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources management will seek to fund its near term operations from continued sale of excess inventories and continued aggressive management of the company s working capital  as well as sources that may include additional borrowings and or private equity 
however  management can make no assurance that these objectives will be sufficient to fund near term liquidity needs and has obtained additional financing to meet operating requirements  as discussed under refinancing below 
as the demand for carbon fiber continues to increase  the company will need additional financing to expand the capacity and execute its capacity expansion program 
due to the timing of development of markets for carbon fiber products  the company s operating activities have used cash in each of the past three fiscal years 
as a result  the company has executed refinancing arrangements and incurred borrowings under credit facilities  supplemented with long term debt financing utilizing the equity in the company s real estate properties  to maintain adequate liquidity to support the company s operating and capital activities 
refinancing in october  the company issued convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount of million to institutional private equity investors 
the convertible debentures have a stated maturity of months and bear interest at per annum and are presently convertible into  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company also issued to the investors six year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of per share 
the fair value of the debt discount associated with the warrants at the time of issuance was estimated to be million and will be amortized as a non cash interest expense over the term of the convertible debt 
proceeds from issuance of these convertible debentures were used to reduce existing hungarian bank debt by million and the balance for working capital purposes which allowed the company to refinance the remaining hungarian bank debt to a three year term loan for million with no covenants going forward 
in december  the company s us bank extended the expiration and waived the financial covenants of the company s revolving credit loan  term loan and mortgage on an existing property from january  to january  the company s us bank also increased the amount available under the revolving credit loan by million to million and increased the term loan by million to million

proceeds from the issuance of these convertible debentures were used for working capital purposes 
as part of the company s january refinancing  the bank lender to the company s hungarian subsidiary amended certain financial covenants and extended the maturity date of its loan to december  in connection with such actions  the bank required that the company make arrangements to settle intercompany accounts payable by zoltek us operations to its hungarian subsidiary in the amount of approximately million 
the bank was unwilling to keep open its offer to restructure zoltek rt 
s loans until after the company s january refinancing package was completed 
prior to the refinancing  the company did not have cash on hand or available borrowings that would enable it to make the settlement of the intercompany accounts required by the hungarian bank 
in order to proceed expeditiously to resolve the company s financing requirements  zsolt rumy  the company s chief executive officer and a director of the company  in december loaned the company million in cash and posted a million letter of credit for the benefit of the company 
this arrangement was approved by the company s board of directors and audit committee 
the loan by mr 
rumy bore interest on the amount advanced and the notional amount of the letter of credit at a rate per annum equal to libor plus with a libor floor of  the same interest rate of the mortgage financing discussed below 
as a result of the company completing the refinancing transactions making available the cash to settle the intercompany accounts  the letter of credit was released 
after converting  into convertible debt as part of the january financing  the remaining million loan was repaid during the third quarter of fiscal also in january  the company entered into a mortgage note with a bank in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the note has a stated maturity of three years and bears interest at a rate of libor plus per annum as of september  with a libor floor of

the loan is collateralized by a security interest in the company s headquarters facility and its two us manufacturing facilities that produce carbon and technical fibers 
the proceeds of this transaction were used to pay down debt of million with its us bank 
of such proceeds  million was held in an escrow account to be released when the company completed certain post closing requirements 
the company completed these requirements during the third quarter of and the million was released from escrow 
due to the january refinancing completed subsequent to the company s fiscal year end  the company s us bank waived the financial covenants through february   the maturity date of the term loan 
additionally  the expiration of the company s revolving credit loan was extended from january  to january  the refinancing allowed the company to execute its business plan  which was uncertain prior to the refinancing

for additional information  see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies outlined below are accounting policies that zoltek believes are key to a full understanding of the company s operations and financial results 
all of the company s accounting policies are in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales on the date title to the sold product transfers to the customer  which is the shipping date 
revenues generated by its entec composite machines subsidiary are recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the percentage of total project cost incurred to date 
the company reviews its accounts receivable on a monthly basis to identify any specific customers for collectability issues 
if the company deems that an amount due from a customer is uncollectible  the amount is recorded in the statement of operations 
during fiscal  and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of sales was earned from one customer in the technical fiber segment 
shipping and handling all amounts billed to a customer in a transaction related to shipping and handling are recorded as revenue and the subsequent cost to the company is recognized as expense in cost of sales  excluding unused capacity 
inventories the company evaluates its ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of future demand  if any  are reserved 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost includes material  labor and overhead 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company s projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales excluding available unused capacity costs on the company s statement of operations in the period in which the revision is made 
in recent years  carbon fiber sales have been depressed by excess capacity across the industry  distressed pricing across most existing markets and weakening economic conditions globally 
these factors combined with the high level of inventories maintained by the company  have resulted in the company reducing the cost of certain carbon fiber inventories to their lower estimated market values 
if demand for products held in inventory does not improve in a reasonable period of time  or further deteriorate  it is possible that the market value of these carbon fiber inventories may further decrease resulting in additional charges to cost of sales excluding available unused capacity costs 
application and development expenses the company is actively pursuing the development of a number of applications for the use of its carbon fiber and related products 
the company is currently party to several developmental agreements with various prospective users of these products for the purpose of accelerating the development of various carbon fiber applications 
additionally  the company is executing several internal developmental strategies to further the use of carbon fiber and consumer and industrial products made from carbon fiber 
as a result  the company incurs certain costs for research  development and engineering of products and manufacturing processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal application and development expenses are presented as an operating item on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
given the company s position and strategy within the carbon fiber industry  it is expected that similar or greater levels of application and development expenses could be incurred in future periods 
unused capacity costs during  the company was not operating its abilene  texas facility at full capacity 
as a result  the company has elected to categorize certain costs related to these idle assets as unused capacity costs 
such costs totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  and include depreciation and other overhead expenses associated with unused capacity 
the unused capacity costs are presented as an operating item on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
as discussed above  the company has resumed certain levels of manufacturing at this facility during fiscal with the reactivation of the abilene plant  unused capacity costs are expected to diminish and  ultimately  be fully absorbed in ongoing production once all the carbon fiber lines start operating in fiscal valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
in determining expected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to a long lived asset or a group of long lived assets  the company must make certain judgments and estimations including the expected market conditions and demand for products produced by the assets  expected product pricing assumptions  and assumptions related to the expected costs to operate the assets 
these judgments and assumptions are particularly challenging as they relate to the company s long lived assets due to the developmental stage and current market conditions of the carbon fiber industry 
it is possible that actual future cash flows related to the company s long lived assets may materially differ from the company s determination of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  if the company s expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company s carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against certain deferred tax assets when realization of those assets are not considered to be more likely than not
