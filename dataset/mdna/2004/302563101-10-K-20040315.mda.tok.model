critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we generally base our estimates on historical experience or other appropriate assumptions that we believe are reasonable and relevant under the circumstances and evaluate them on an on going basis 
the results of these estimation processes form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies discussed in remainder of this section of our management s discussion and analysis md a affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these are further commented upon in applicable sections on results of operations  financial position and liquidity and capital resources that follow 
information about the significant accounting policies we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k and should also be considered 
liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae our liability for losses and lae also referred to as our loss and lae reserves is the largest liability of our company and the most sensitive financial statement item to estimation and judgment 
medical professional liability mpl insurance  including business written directly and reinsurance assumed  is our primary line of business and accounted for million and million  or and  of our total consolidated liability for losses and lae as of december  and  respectively 
the remainder of our reserves represent other smaller lines and products 
the primary factors affecting our estimates of how much we will pay and therefore reserve for insurance claims  defense costs and other related costs are frequency and severity trends numbers of claims and how much we will pay for each claim on average for one or more periods  frequency of claims closed with indemnity payments the percentage of claims received that ultimately result in a loss payment versus those that are settled and closed without a loss payment  the timing or pattern of future payments  the amount of defense cost we will pay for each claim or group of claims  and inflationary trends that are expected to bear on future loss and lae payments 
these factors  in turn  can be affected by the judicial environment and tort related trends over time 
it is also important to note that one or more of the actuarial methods used by us do not rely on specific assumptions for these factors  rather  these assumptions are developed as a by product of the application of the methods  which may then be monitored and factored into the final judgmental considerations of the selection of the point estimate and range of reasonable values around the point estimate from among the methods 
all of the above mentioned factors individually can and will generally vary from one period to the next over time but are estimated to approximate their ultimate values in setting reserve estimates 
in addition  due to the relatively small number of claims and the average cost per claim  any change in the trends assumed in the ultimate values for these factors may be expected to result in a significant change in the reserve estimates 
because our aggregate loss and lae reserves are so large  this also means that virtually any change in the level of our carried reserves will be material to results of operations and may be material to our financial position 
as an example  a increase or decrease in carried reserves  net of reinsurance  as of december   would result in an after tax addition or reduction in reported net income of nearly million  or of our consolidated net income for the year ended december  a typical range of reasonable values for mpl reserve estimates is considered to be as wide as  thus  our results of operations and financial position are very sensitive to our reserve estimates and judgments  in addition to the performance of the business itself 
reinsurance reinsurance does not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders 
therefore  the failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
the amounts recoverable from reinsurers on our unpaid losses and lae are calculated by applying the terms of the respective ceded reinsurance contracts to our estimates of the underlying loss and lae reserves that are subject to reinsurance 
thus  to the extent our reinsured reserves change or are adjusted  so will the related reinsurance recoverable amounts and our exposure 
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk with respect to the individual reinsurers that participate in our ceded programs to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
we hold collateral in the form of letters of credit or trust accounts for amounts recoverable from reinsurers that are not designated as authorized reinsurers by the applicable departments of insurance of the states that have jurisdiction over the underlying business 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are estimated and recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is estimated and recorded if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we estimate and believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or those estimates are adjusted in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which would impact our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets effective january   we adopted financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized through charges to income  but do continue to be subject to annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment testing based on estimated fair values 
during the first quarter of  we performed transitional impairment testing required under the new standard and took a charge in the form of a cumulative effect of accounting change for million  net of tax effects  as of january  we have obtained independent appraisals annually since the adoption of fas  the most recent of which was performed as of december   which indicate that our goodwill and other intangible assets are fully recoverable 
our remaining goodwill and intangible assets of million will continue to be subject to impairment testing through independent appraisal or otherwise at least annually  and potentially more often should a triggering event occur 
a triggering event under fas might include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  or a loss of key personnel 
investments our invested assets comprise our largest single asset class and consist mostly of investment securities in the form of fixed income investments in bonds and notes 
our fixed income investment securities are carried at their market values and accounted for million and million or and of our total cash and invested assets  and and of our total assets  respectively as of december  and unrealized gains or losses in their market values are recorded directly in shareholders equity  net of tax effects  as a component of other comprehensive income 
there is an exception to the treatment noted above if and when an investment security considered to be available for sale is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
an other than temporary impairment may occur when the market value of a security falls below its cost by a material amount for an extended period of time generally one year but can be less under certain circumstances or when other creditworthiness issues arise with regard to an issuer 
if and when a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired it is written down to its estimated market value with a corresponding realized investment loss recognized in net income 
commitments and contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by the financial guaranty associations in the states in which they conduct business for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies of insolvent insurers 
generally  these associations can assess member insurers on the basis of written premiums in their particular states 
in addition to standard assessments  the florida and missouri legislatures may also levy special assessments to settle claims caused by certain catastrophic losses 
we would be assessed on the basis of premiums written 
during  a special assessment was levied on first professionals and apac that totaled million 
no special assessments were made in or in addition  we could be subject to additional assessments in the future as a result of damages caused by catastrophic losses  such as a hurricane 
revenue recognition premium income  which is our main source of revenue  is generally recognized pro rata over the respective period of each policy 
premium receivables are recorded net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
some of our assumed reinsurance agreements with physicians reciprocal insurers pri for the year ended december  and prior  contained adjustable premiums based upon loss experience 
our financial statements for the year ended december   included estimated adjustments accrued based on our loss experience under these agreements 
these agreements have since been non renewed  amended or commuted 
the assumed reinsurance agreements with pri for periods since then are fixed premium contracts with no such adjustable features 
see the following md a section 
business with pri reciprocal management agreement administrators for the professions  inc afp has a year management agreement with pri  under which it receives a management fee annually equal to of pri s direct premiums written 
the current term of the management agreement runs through december  under the terms of the management agreement  afp receives this fee in exchange for performing services necessary to conduct and manage the entire operation of pri 
such services include all or substantially all marketing  underwriting  policy issuance  policy administration  investment management  claims handling  and general and administrative functions  including human resources  accounting  financial reporting  and others  on an on going basis over the life of the agreement 
afp is also reimbursed by pri for certain expenses paid on pri s behalf 
the expenses reimbursed by pri are principally salaries and related payroll expenses  and overhead costs associated with claims  legal and risk management course personnel employed by afp who work on pri business 
the management fees are estimated  billed and collected on a monthly basis 
our entitlement to such fees is ultimately based upon the provision of all of the services necessary to run pri over the term of the contract 
revenues are recognized as earned when they are billed as this accounting treatment reasonably approximates and accomplishes a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the required services during the quarters and the year 
the fees estimated and billed  which are recognized in income  are reduced by an estimated provision for return premiums 
see the md a section  contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements that follows for a discussion and analysis of an additional commitment and related contingent liability assumed by afp as a result of an amendment to its management agreement with pri  effective january  afp also has two subsidiaries  fpic intermediaries fpic intermediaries and group data corporation group data 
fpic intermediaries acts as a reinsurance co broker and intermediary for our insurance subsidiaries 
group data acts as a co agent and co broker for our internal insurance needs and for the purchase of structured settlements from time to time for settled mpl claims for pri 
the reciprocal management segment also includes fpic s owned subsidiary professional medical administrators pma  which acts as co broker  intermediary and manager of reinsurance programs for pri s program business in pennsylvania  whereby pri assumes the premiums and risks insured 
pri also owns of pma and until august  our subsidiary  first professionals acted as the fronting carrier for pri for the program business managed on its behalf by pma 
since then  pri has used an outside carrier to act as its fronting carrier 
the financial results for these business arrangements make up our reciprocal management segment and are presented and discussed in the following applicable sections of this md a 
additional financial information and disclosures about our reciprocal management segment and business can be found in note  organization and nature of operations  note  commitments and contingencies  note  segment information  and note  related party transactions  to our consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance with pri our insurance subsidiary  first professionals  assumes reinsurance from pri 
as discussed above  program business assumed by pri in pennsylvania was written on first professionals policy forms  as fronting carrier  through july  effective august   pri engaged an unrelated fronting carrier for this business and  with the exception of tail coverage  no new or renewal business is being written on first professionals policy forms 
the assumed reinsurance and fronting fees on pri business of first professionals are included in the insurance segment and are also discussed further in the following applicable sections of this md a 
additional financial information and disclosures about our assumed reinsurance and fronting fees from pri can be found in note  related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements 
pri is a major client of ours in addition to their contributions to our results of operations  our agreements and business arrangements with pri as a major client of ours also means that our revenues and results of operations are financially sensitive to its revenues and financial condition 
we do not own pri  or have a controlling financial interest in pri  nor is pri considered a variable interest entity under fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities as revised  and so pri s financial statements are not consolidated or included in ours 
instead  pri is similar to a mutual insurer and the risks and rewards of ownership vest with the policyholders of pri 
pri and our subsidiary  afp  are regulated by the new york state insurance department the nysid 
pri files its annual and quarterly statements with the nysid containing its statutory basis financial statements and other data 
afp and pri are required to file audited financial statements annually with the nysid obtained from the same qualified independent accounting firm 
pri  as an mpl insurer  is subject to many of the same types of risks as those of our insurance subsidiaries and mpl companies generally 
these risks include  but are not limited to  rate adequacy  adverse loss experience  and the effects of changes in market interest rates that it can earn on invested assets 
pri files information about its rates annually with the new york state insurance department 
pri implemented an rate increase effective july  following several years of level rates 
growth at pri is also subject to surplus constraints  however  as a reciprocal  pri is able to operate with lower surplus and at higher leverage ratios than non reciprocals such as our insurance subsidiaries 
pri s policyholders surplus exceeds the minimum amount required under new york insurance laws and regulations 
new york insurance laws and regulations do not impose risk adjusted capital requirements 
further  as allowed under new york insurance laws  pri has requested and received permission from the nysid to follow the permitted practice of discounting its loss and lae reserves 
the nysid mandates the insurance rates pri and other new york carriers are allowed to charge their policyholders 
these include the rates charged for the policies in excess of million and for covered extended reporting endorsements for death  disability and retirement  which have been reinsured to first professionals 
under new york insurance statutes  the nysid is also authorized to surcharge pri s policyholders in the event it is determined that those rates were deficient in one or more prior years as a result of adverse loss development 
the amount of the surcharge may be up to of pri s policyholders premiums annually until such deficiency is recovered 
despite the unique aspects of the business and regulatory environments pri operates in  as an mpl insurer  it is still subject to many of the same types of risks as those of other mpl and property casualty insurers  including similar risks to many of those described under safe harbor disclosure 
results of operations consolidated overview the three years ended december  was a period of significant activity and progress for our company 
net income in increased to million  or per diluted share  up and  respectively over income before accounting change of million and per diluted share for income before accounting change for was up over compared with net income of million  or per diluted share 
all three of our business segments were profitable in the year was the third year in a row of significant improvements in insurance pricing 
in addition  our reciprocal management and third party administration tpa segments have reported improved profits 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our net loss for includes a million after tax million pre tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change related to the adoption of fas on goodwill and other intangible assets 
the transitional impairment charges  resulting from the adoption of fas  were associated entirely with our non insurance segments 
our income before the cumulative effect of accounting change was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  during  we completed the placement of million in senior notes and created three trusts that issued year trust preferred securities for which the proceeds from such issuances together with cash previously contributed to the trusts were used to purchase junior subordinated debentures from fpic totaling million 
we used the proceeds along with other internally generated funds to retire our bank term loan and revolving credit facility 
we also completed the integration of apac operations and transitioned the management of apac and intermed insurance company intermed into first professionals 
during the fourth quarter  we negotiated and completed the commutation of our reinsurance with gerling global reinsurance corporation of america gerling 
we also negotiated our primary excess of loss reinsurance program renewal for at a reduced cost for the first time in several years 
finally  we played an active part in tort reform on behalf of our policyholders  as well as the healthcare economy and the citizens of the state of florida 
our revenues and expenses were lower in than most of the decline was by design and the result of growth management initiatives we put in place in  designed to level the amount of growth in our policyholder counts following an unprecedented period of growth at our insurance subsidiaries in and our mpl insurance markets have hardened significantly since net investment income was also lower in while the equity markets recovered in  interest rates fell to record lows during and for the third straight year  although rates did recover somewhat by the end of and exceeded year end levels 
our total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily the result of price improvements on our core mpl business and growth in the number of policyholders 
net premiums earned on our mpl business increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenues earned by our reciprocal management segment increased million primarily as the result of an increase in claims administration and management fees earned 
in addition  brokerage commissions earned by fpic intermediaries increased when compared with the prior year 
our total expenses for the year ended december  increased less than to million from million for the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred for the year ended december  increased million or when compared with the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred on our mpl business increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred in were also reduced by losses and lae incurred of million that were ceded under the net account quota share reinsurance agreement with hannover re hannover re agreement 
the increase in net losses and lae incurred for the year ended december   reflects the growth in our business  taking into consideration expected loss trends 
the increases in total expenses were offset primarily by ceding commissions related to the hannover re net account quota share reinsurance agreement and our adoption of fas the adoption of fas eliminated amortization expense of approximately million for the year ended december  hannover re net account quota share reinsurance agreement one of the most significant financial developments for us in was our entering into the hannover re agreement 
it is supplemental to our other reinsurance programs and represents a very large reinsurance cession for us 
future plans we plan to continue to focus on growing our insurance capital base and to work to reduce the additional reinsurance we are now carrying so that we can retain and grow this business for our own account 
a great deal of the progress we made has been possible in large part because of favorable market conditions we experienced since the end of therefore  one of the most obvious risks to our ability to continue this level of performance would be an unexpected increase in competition resulting in a softening of the market and leading to downward pressure on our insurance rates and profits 
there can be no assurance as to how long the current stable market conditions will continue 
results of operations insurance segment our insurance segment is made up of our four insurance subsidiaries  first professionals  apac and the tenere group  inc tenere companies intermed and interlex 
fpic operations are also included in the insurance segment due to the segment s size and prominence and the substantial attention the holding company devotes to the segment 
financial and selected other data of our insurance segment for the years ended december   and is summarized in the table below 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
insurance segment results and selected other information percentage change percentage change direct and assumed premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned net investment income commission income net realized investment gains finance charge and other income intersegment revenue total revenues net losses and lae other underwriting expense interest expense on debt other expenses intersegment expense total expenses income loss from operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change less income tax expense benefit income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change less cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss selected insurance segment information net paid losses and lae on professional liability claims average net paid loss per professional liability claim closed with indemnity payment total professional liability claims and incidents reported during the period total professional liability claims with indemnity payment includes claims that were not closed total professional liability claims and incidents closed without indemnity payment total professional liability claims and incidents that remained open professional liability policyholders excludes policyholders under fronting arrangements professional liability policyholders under fronting arrangements insurance overview insurance segment net income decreased for the year ended december  the decrease for the year was the result of lower net realized investment gains  lower net investment income  higher debt related costs  and higher net intersegment expenses  comprised mainly of commissions payable to the reciprocal management segment 
the holding company  which is grouped with the insurance segment for reporting purposes  incurred debt related costs of million after income taxes million before income taxes during as a result of unwinding interest rate swap agreements in the second and fourth quarters in connection with the repayment and retirement of our term loan and revolving credit facility 
our improved underwriting margin defined as net premiums earned less net losses and lae and other underwriting expenses of million after tax million before income taxes is mostly attributable to pricing improvements 
approximately million of the after tax improvement million  pre tax in is attributable to the hannover re agreement 
insurance segment net income increased million for the year ended december   from a net loss of million for the year ended december   primarily due to price improvements on our mpl business and growth in the number of policyholders 
in addition  net losses and lae for reflect adverse development and a corresponding prior year reserve charge approximately million that did not recur in net investment income declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  effective october   we sold the renewal rights of interlex s lpl insurance business to a subsidiary of professionals direct  inc  a non affiliate  for million 
the sale of interlex s renewal rights allows us to re dedicate interlex s capital to our core mpl business 
insurance underwriting results premiums  losses and lae  and underwriting expenses net premiums earned  net losses and lae incurred and other underwriting expenses  all declined  and  respectively for the year  primarily as a result of the reinsurance ceded under the hannover re agreement  which became effective july   and other growth management initiatives put into place in direct and assumed premiums written direct and assumed premiums written decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the small decrease primarily reflects the offsetting trends of price improvements at all our insurance companies and growth in our core mpl book of business in florida  offset by lower premiums on fronted business and lpl business and lower mpl premiums in certain other states 
direct and assumed premiums written increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase primarily results from rate increases realized and growth in the number of policyholders in our core mpl business 
first professionals implemented rate increases for new and renewal policies in january and december  and again in december  apac implemented rate increases in july and  and intermed implemented rate increases in november and july we also experienced growth in direct premiums written under fronting arrangements for workers compensation business of million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the growth in direct premiums written was partially offset by a decline of million in our group accident and health a h programs  which were discontinued in november of net premiums written net premiums written increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the small increase in net premiums written is attributable to the growth management initiatives put into place during  and is basically the result of planned reductions in our overall numbers of policyholders in  and continuing pricing improvements  which have largely offset one another 
ceded written premiums under the hannover re agreement were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
thus  while the hannover re agreement did have a significant impact on the change in net premiums earned and our underwriting results between and  it did not have a significant impact on the overall change in net premiums written between and net premiums written decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in net premiums written is related to the hannover re agreement effective july  between our largest subsidiary  first professionals  and two companies of the hannover re group 
hannover re net account quota share reinsurance agreement net premiums earned  net losses and lae incurred  and other underwriting expenses incurred were reduced by amounts ceded under the hannover re agreement of million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   and by million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  before the amounts ceded under the hannover re agreement  net premiums earned  net losses and lae and other underwriting expenses increased in by million  million  and million  respectively 
the hannover re net account quota share reinsurance cession resulted in improvements to our net underwriting margin of million in and million in million and million  respectively after income taxes 
the agreement resulted in an increase in our insurance segment s total income from operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change of million million after income taxes for the year and million million after income taxes in excluding the effects of net investment income we earned on funds withheld 
finance charges associated with the hannover re agreement are included in other expenses and were million in and million in the increase in these charges was due to growth in the funds withheld account under the agreement 
under the terms of the hannover re agreement  we ceded approximately million of our unearned premiums  and million of our direct written premiums  net of other reinsurance  in the agreement  which calls for first professionals to cede quota share portions of its written premiums  contains adjustable features including sliding scale ceding commissions and a cap on the amount of losses that may be ceded to the reinsurer  all of which serve to make it what is commonly referred to as a finite type reinsurance contract 
the original agreement also contained a loss corridor on business ceded through march   but it was removed and other modifications were made in connection with the amendment and extension of the agreement discussed below 
the effect of these features is to limit the reinsurers aggregate exposure to loss and reduce the ultimate costs of this reinsurance to first professionals as the ceding company 
these features also have the effect of reducing the amount of protection relative to the quota share amount of premiums ceded by first professionals 
while first professionals does not receive pro rata protection relative to the amount of premiums ceded  the amount of reinsurance protection is significant  as determined in accordance with guidance under both gaap and statutory accounting practices 
in addition to ceding a significant portion of our risks to hannover re  the agreement also allows us to reduce our financial leverage and to realize immediate reimbursement for our up front acquisition costs  which  in turn  lessens strain on our capital 
on may   we entered into an amendment to the hannover re agreement that  effective april   extends its expiration date to include policies written and renewed through december  the agreement has also been amended to remove the loss corridor on business written and ceded  beginning april   and to reduce the lower end of the sliding scale ceding commission range from to 
a provision has also been added that will allow first professionals to reduce the quota share amount of premiums to be ceded under the agreement in cancellation provisions have also been added  one that gives first professionals the option to cancel the agreement on or after january   with days notice  and one that gives hannover re the option to cancel the agreement as of the effective date of any decrease in first professionals base rate for its mpl insurance policies that exceeds 
net premiums earned the growth in net premiums earned and related increases in loss costs and other underwriting expenses in before the hannover re agreement were primarily the result of pricing improvements 
the year marks the third consecutive year that first professionals  apac and intermed have implemented significant rate increases 
these price improvements also contributed to the increase in net premiums earned  excluding the hannover re agreement  in contrast to the significant decline in the number of professional liability policyholders for all companies combined by nearly  or  to  as of december  from  as of december  of this decline  the sale of the renewal rights to the interlex legal professional liability book of business in accounted for approximately  fewer policies 
the remaining declines occurred in non core states and in missouri as we freed up capacity  with a view towards using it for first professionals core mpl business in florida 
the declines in missouri were expected as we implemented a very large rate increase in net premiums earned increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net premiums earned is due to rate increases that we implemented and growth in the number of policyholders 
net premiums earned on our mpl business increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  losses and lae incurred our loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was  a decrease of from for the year ended december  our loss and lae ratios before the effects of the hannover re agreement were and for and  respectively 
a loss ratio is defined as the ratio of loss and lae incurred to net premiums earned 
the decrease in our loss and lae ratio for is smaller than the level of pricing improvements we have made 
this is because the significant price increases at our smaller companies  apac and intermed  occurred relatively recently and there is a corresponding time lag before the underlying written premiums are earned and the resulting underwriting improvements would be recognized 
intermed experienced higher than expected losses in and took an rate increase in august apac also experienced a smaller  unanticipated increase in its loss experience in in addition  the overall costs of our ceded excess of loss reinsurance increased in  which also had the effect of reducing net premiums earned and increasing our loss and lae ratios  accordingly 
the negative effects on the loss and lae ratios of our smaller companies  however  were offset by the more significant improvements in the loss and lae costs incurred relative to net premiums earned at first professionals 
in addition to being much larger than intermed and apac  first professionals began implementing significant pricing improvements earlier and has continued to do so over a longer period 
net losses and lae incurred increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred in were reduced by an increase in ceded losses and lae incurred under the hannover re agreement of million 
the increase in net losses and lae incurred for the year ended december  reflects growth in business  taking into consideration expected loss trends 
our loss ratios for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the reported loss ratio for the year ended december  is primarily due to a significant prior year reserve charge taken in  which was not necessary in  loss expense reduction and productivity  our exit from our former group a h business and other  which were partially offset by the effects of the hannover re agreement 
selected loss and lae data the increases in net paid losses and lae during and and  respectively are in line overall with growth in our business in and  taking into account the time lag inherent in claims processing and differences in reinsurance terms on business written in and adjusted for the effects of these factors  our average net paid losses and overall severity trends were in line with those assumed in our carried reserves 
for the years ended december  and  the consolidated number of our professional liability policyholders grew approximately and  respectively 
our loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance  also grew by and  respectively  in and the growth in our business in and was also the significant factor in the growth in newly reported claims and incidents in and our total inventory of unpaid professional liability claims and incidents in and newly reported claims and incidents declined slightly in as we reduced our book of professional liability business in this decrease was offset to some extent by an acceleration of claims and incidents at first professional that occurred as a result of the florida tort reform legislation  which became effective september  as a result  we received approximately to newly reported claims that we believe were accelerated from future periods to meet the new florida tort legislation deadline 
we have since experienced an offsetting trend in the form of a reduction in newly reported claims 
the number of claims with an indemnity payment cwip during also decreased from s cwip claims 
the percentage of cwip to all closed claims for was  or percentage point higher than the cwip percentage of 
our and cwip percentages are significantly lower than s cwip percentage of 
this significant improvement is largely the result of claims management initiatives implemented beginning in  and the implementation of more restrictive underwriting and risk selection criteria 
the average net paid loss per indemnity claim closed with payment increased in  which although higher than our assumed loss trend  can be attributed to the effects of the annual aggregate deductibles under our and excess of loss reinsurance treaties and the impact of now retaining a portion of our excess of loss reinsurance as a result of the gerling commutation 
it should also be noted that all of our loss and lae data presented above is calendar year information and  thus can fluctuate above and below the long term coverage year assumptions used in estimating our loss and lae reserves from period to period 
other underwriting expenses our other underwriting expenses were million  or lower in than the ceding commission under the hannover re agreement  which is a credit to other underwriting expenses  increased million from million in to million in other underwriting expenses  excluding the effects of the hannover re agreement  increased million  or 
this increase compares favorably with the corresponding increase in net premiums earned and is indicative of an overall gain in productivity 
the ratio of other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned before the effects of the hannover re agreement decreased from to 
other underwriting expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in other underwriting expenses is attributable to ceding commissions recognized under the terms of the hannover re agreement in the amount of million 
in addition  first professionals  our largest insurance subsidiary  performed a study of its expenses incurred in the administration of claims and based on the results of this study  decreased the amount of expenses allocated to lae in investment results net investment income our net investment income declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  these declines in our net investment income are primarily the result of the prolonged status of prevailing interest rates at historically low levels 
as a result  we continue to invest current funds primarily in fixed income securities with shorter maturities and durations and maintain significant short term invested cash 
while these holdings reduce our exposure to losses should the interest environment change and rates begin to rise  they also produce lower current income 
net investment income declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in net investment income was primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates and reduced yields on fixed income investments  beginning in the second half of we also continued to hold significant funds in short term invested cash in anticipation of possible improvements in fixed income rates rather than committing those funds to longer term investments at historically low yields 
the effects of historically low yields have been offset at least to some extent by growth in cash and invested assets 
realized investment gains and losses we realized gains of million and losses of million on investment securities sold during the year  resulting in net realized investment gains on sales of debt and equity securities of million for the year ended december  we also realized gains of million on the sale of real estate during the first quarter of also included in net realized gains and losses were charges of million for other than temporary impairments otti of two private equity holdings 
included in the otti charge was million related to our investment in american professional assurance  ltd 
apal 
plans were put into place during the second quarter of to transition management of our apac insurance subsidiary to first professionals and to non renew our existing management agreement with apa management  inc apam and our quota share reinsurance agreements with apal effective december  the quota share reinsurance agreements with apal comprise a significant component of its revenues 
in addition to this anticipated decline in future revenues  apal reported net losses and declines in shareholder s equity in its most recent financial statements provided to fpic during the second quarter of net realized investment gains increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  certain securities may be liquidated from time to time in order to reposition the portfolio or to take advantage of current market and economic conditions  which result in realized investment gains or losses 
however our investment strategy remains focused on high quality  fixed income securities held for the long term 
the increase in net realized investment gains in is a reflection of this strategy 
unrealized investment gains and losses as of december   our consolidated investment portfolios of bonds and us government securities and equity securities had net unrealized gains of million comprised of gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
as of december   our consolidated investment portfolios of bonds and us government securities and equity securities had net unrealized gains of million comprised of gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
other finance charges and other income  interest expense  other expenses and income tax expenses finance charges and other income finance charges and other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  finance charges and other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the fluctuation of finance changes and other income related to the inclusion of million received as a result of the sale of the renewal rights on interlex s lpl business during interest expense on debt the increase in interest expense on debt for the year as compared with is primarily due to charges of million included in expense to unwind swap agreements associated with the pay down and retirement of our former bank credit facility 
this was offset by the lower total borrowing costs  as compared with the former bank credit facility  of fpic s newly issued junior subordinated debentures and unsecured senior notes and the recapture of the amortization of unrealized losses of previous interest rate swap agreements 
the increase in other expenses in is due to growth of the funds withheld by us under the hannover re agreement and the corresponding finance cost in the form of interest credited to hannover re on those funds of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
other expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in other expenses is due to the interest related to the hannover re agreement  partially offset by a decline in amortization expense due to our adoption of fas in accordance with fas  we ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the first quarter of the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended december  is primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change when compared with the prior year and additional tax expense recognized in associated with the examination of fpic s and federal income tax returns by the internal revenue service 
income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  from an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  income tax expense in increased primarily as a result of an increase in pre tax income when compared with we recognized an income tax benefit in because our permanent differences  primarily tax exempt interest  were greater than our pre tax income 
the effect of these permanent differences was proportionately less when compared with pre tax income in  resulting in tax expense at an effective rate of 
in  we also engaged outside investment managers and began re positioning investments including the re positioning of investments in tax exempt municipal securities to investments in taxable securities

the growth in these revenues was the result of growth in of premiums written at pri and higher ceded premiums at pri and our insurance companies  which are co brokered by fpic intermediaries 
intersegment revenues and expenses primarily relate to commission income from first professionals for the placement of reinsurance and the management of the pennsylvania fronting program  and the holding company s overhead allocation  respectively

reciprocal management income before cumulative effect of accounting change increased during the year ended december   primarily due to higher management fees and commission income 
the growth in these revenues was the result of growth in of premiums written at pri and higher ceded premiums at pri and our insurance companies  which are co brokered by fpic intermediaries 
also contributing to the higher income before cumulative effect of accounting change were lower total expenses due to ceasing the amortization of goodwill  previously recognized in other expenses  in accordance with the adoption of fas during the first quarter of the reciprocal management segment recorded a transitional impairment charge of million  after income taxes  during the first quarter of  as a result of the adoption of fas this transitional impairment charge is accounted for as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
the non cash transitional impairment charge primarily reflects certain intangibles and synergies  which  in our opinion  are opportunistic in nature and carry a significant degree of uncertainty  therefore  we treated these intangibles conservatively in the valuation required by fas reciprocal management revenues management fees earned by afp are classified with claims administration and management fees in our statements of income 
they are comprised entirely of management fees from pri and the increase for the years ended december  and are due to the corresponding increase in the direct premiums written by pri 
in accordance with the management agreement between afp and pri  afp receives a management fee equal to of pri s direct premiums written  with an adjustment for expected return premiums 
effective january   afp and pri amended the management agreement  including the elimination of the sharing by afp of of pri s statutory net income or loss  which accounts for the decline in other income 
the amendment was approved by the new york state insurance department 
afp also agreed to pay annual interest on the profit share amounts already earned and collected under the original agreement for  and  while those years remain open for possible future re determination and adjustment  if any 
additional information about our management agreement with pri appears in the preceding section of this md a  business with pri 
the increase in commission income for the years ended december  and is primarily due to increases in co brokerage commissions earned by fpic intermediaries from third party reinsurers for the placement of reinsurance and by pma based on growth in the insurance program it manages for pri in pennsylvania 
fpic intermediaries brokerage commissions are determined as a percentage of reinsurance premiums ceded and have increased significantly as the underlying ceded premiums have grown at both our insurance subsidiaries and pri  for which fpic intermediaries participates in the placement of reinsurance 
in addition  commission income of approximately million was recognized in as a result of a brokerage fee earned from hannover re related to the placement of our net account quota share reinsurance agreement 
additional information about fpic intermediaries and its business with pri appears in the preceding section of this md a  business with pri 
the increase in intersegment revenues in was driven by an increase in reinsurance rates that increased the commissions earned on reinsurance treaties brokered for first professionals 
reciprocal management expenses the increase reported in reciprocal management expenses for the year ended december  is due to the combination of an increase in operating expenses at afp to manage growth at pri and an increase in operating and commission expenses at pma associated with an increase in premiums written and placed on behalf of pri 
the increase in reciprocal management expenses for the year ended december  is due to an increase in operating expenses incurred to manage the growth in business at pri  offset partially by a decline in risk management department expenses when compared to the year ended december  as described above  the management agreement between afp and pri was amended in as part of the amended agreement  pri is to reimburse afp for of risk management department expenses

growth in the number of covered members serviced by the ambulance service organization to which we provide administrative services along with cost savings and productivity initiatives helped improve our margins in tpa income before cumulative effect of accounting change increased during the year ended december   primarily due to improved operating margins and lower total expenses 
operating margins improved through a combination of cost saving and productivity initiatives and pricing improvements 
total expenses for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to ceasing the amortization of goodwill  previously recognized in other expenses  in accordance with the adoption of fas during the first quarter of the tpa segment recorded a transitional impairment charge of million  after income taxes  during the first quarter of  as a result of the adoption of fas this transitional impairment charge is accounted for as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
the non cash transitional impairment charge primarily reflects changes in market conditions and an increase in competition in recent years in the markets served by the tpa segment 
tpa revenues claims administration fees earned by emi are classified with claims administration and management fees in our consolidated statements of income 
the increase in claims administration fees in is primarily due to an increase in the number of members serviced by the ambulance service organization to which we provide administrative services and to a lesser extent  improvements in pricing 
the decline in commission income earned for the period ended december  is the result of a change in contract terms with a major client 
the contract was changed from receiving commission income based on a percentage of premiums to a fixed fee for service basis 
our results of operations for the period ended december  include our albuquerque tpa division  which was disposed of in december excluding the effect of the albuquerque tpa division  claims administration and management fees and claims administration and management expenses increased million and million  respectively for the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december  these increases reflect the revenues and costs incurred as a result of growth in new business 
tpa expenses the lower increase in claims administration and management expenses for the year ended december  when compared with the increase in claims administration and management fees for the same period in is the result of certain expense saving initiatives and productivity improvements achieved by servicing growth in covered lives with our existing personnel and service platforms 
these initiatives and others have also accounted for the improved margins in versus other expenses for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to ceasing the amortization of goodwill in accordance with the adoption of fas  as described above 
in addition  the year results include a restructuring charge of approximately million  before income taxes  in connection with the disposition of the brokerage services  inc division of emi in albuquerque  new mexico  which did not recur in we sold the division s assets and cancelled its service agreements with self insured customers 
certain other contracts were retained and are serviced by our jacksonville  florida division 
the restructuring activity was a continuation of our consolidation of the tpa operations and concluded the restructuring activities of the albuquerque division that began during management s discussion analysis of financial position december  compared to december  cash and investments cash and investments increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in cash and investments is primarily due to growth in insurance premiums and the cash received from the commutation of reinsurance formerly placed with gerling  which helped generate net operating cash flows of million for the year ended december  other invested assets declined million to million as of december  from million as of december  we sold our investment in american physicians insurance services  inc aps to its majority shareholder for approximately million and recognized a small gain on the transaction less than million 
we also recognized other than temporary impairments on two privately held investments totaling million in one of these was our investment in apal  which we wrote down by million to million in partially offsetting the decline were investments in three wholly owned trusts of approximately million  in aggregate  established for the sole purpose of issuing our trust preferred securities 
insurance assets premium receivables  reinsurance recoverable  ceded unearned premiums  and deferred policy acquisition costs insurance assets  including premiums receivable  reinsurance recoverable and related assets  increased as a group as of december  when compared with december  the growth in our insurance assets is primarily the result of continued growth in the insurance premiums of our core mpl business during due from reinsurers on unpaid losses increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  approximately million of the increase in due from reinsurers on unpaid losses is attributable to reserves ceded under the hannover re agreement during the year of the remaining increase  approximately million represents the growth in reinsurance recoverable under our primary excess of loss reinsurance program covering our core business 
in keeping with our growth management strategy  we have exited all but one remaining fronting program as of december  or prior 
therefore  we expect the insurance assets and liabilities associated with former fronting programs to level off and begin to decline in the future 
commutation of gerling global reinsurance in the fourth quarter of  we successfully negotiated and completed the commutation of reinsurance formerly placed with gerling 
gerling ceased writing and renewing business voluntarily in the united states during and we replaced gerling s participation in our reinsurance programs beginning in a 
m 
best downgraded gerling several times during and ultimately ceased assigning them a rating 
under the terms of the commutation  we received million in exchange for a complete release of gerling from their reinsurance obligations to us under our  and primary excess of loss reinsurance programs  in which gerling participated at  and  respectively  and its assumption of non standard risks under a small special facultative reinsurance program 
the related assets for amounts due from gerling on reinsured unpaid losses and ceded unearned premiums were eliminated and the remaining funds received were accounted for as an increase in our loss and lae reserves in the form of bulk reserves 
no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction 
this transaction resulted in a reduction from the amounts due from reinsurers on unpaid losses  offsetting some of the growth in this asset for deferred taxes our net deferred tax asset dta remained level as of december  when compared with december  increases in our net dta resulting from growth in our business and the related additional discounting of loss and lae reserves  the reduction in unearned premiums  and other temporary differences that generate dtas  were essentially offset by the continued amortization of tax deductible goodwill  for which a dta is realized and reduced annually 
insurance liabilities liability for losses and lae  unearned premiums  reinsurance payable and paid in advance premiums the increases in our insurance liabilities as of december   including the liability for losses and lae  unearned premiums and reinsurance payable are attributable to growth in our core mpl insurance business 
we conducted in house actuarial studies of our loss and lae reserves as of december  and also during the third quarter using data as of june  the results of our most recent actuarial study and review confirm that our aggregate loss and lae reserves as of december   are adequate 
the implied range of reasonable loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance  estimated by fpic as of december   was million to million 
our consolidated loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance  were million in aggregate as of december   which represents management s best estimate and was approximately equal to our in house actuary s point estimate within his range 
our independent actuary has also tested the loss and lae reserves of each of our individual insurance subsidiaries as of december  and has issued his reports thereon  which have been filed with the florida and missouri insurance departments 
one item of note was the acceleration of claims estimated at approximately to claims at first professionals as a result of tort reform legislation adopted in florida  which had the effect of increasing the actuarial point estimate as of december  for additional information about these developments  please refer to the applicable preceding insurance segment sections of the md a  insurance underwriting results premiums  losses and lae  and underwriting expenses  losses and lae incurred and selected loss and lae data 
approximately million of the increase in reinsurance payable for the year ended december  was the result of business ceded under the hannover re net account quota share agreement 
this increase in reinsurance payable was partially offset by the payment of premiums due under fpic s primary reinsurance agreement 
long term debt during  we completed the placement of million in senior notes and created three trusts that issued year trust preferred securities for which the proceeds from such issuances together with cash previously contributed to the trusts were used to purchase junior subordinated debentures from fpic totaling million 
we used the proceeds along with other internally generated funds to retire our bank term loan and revolving credit facility  make a capital contribution to our insurance operations and unwind hedge agreements related to the revolving credit facility and term loan 
the new securities issued mature in years and are described more fully under the section  liquidity and capital resources  below 
other assets and liabilities the significant decreases in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively  as of december   are primarily attributable to purchase and sale transactions involving investment securities  which were entered into prior to december   but for which settlements occurred in january we did not have similar investment transactions at the end of shareholder equity our shareholders equity increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  our book value per share increased to from 
net income contributed million to the growth in our shareholders equity  while accumulated other comprehensive income oci declined approximately million 
the decline in accumulated oci as of december  versus december   was caused by an increase in prevailing market interest rates on fixed income securities  offset by the elimination of unrealized losses of million resulting from the termination interest rate swaps associated with our prior bank term loan and revolving credit facility  and the corresponding decrease in the unrealized gains on our investment securities  which are included in accumulated oci  net of income tax effects 
the remaining increase of million was due to the exercise of stock options by directors and employees during and the associated payments made to fpic upon exercise of these options 
refer to the applicable section in liquity and capital resources for information about the restricted net assets of our insurance subsidiaries 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements fpic has various contractual obligations  which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
fpic also has items that represent contractual obligations  commitments and contingent liabilities that are not recorded on its balance sheet or that are considered to possess off balance sheet risks beyond their respective amounts otherwise reflected in the balance sheet 
these include derivative financial instruments  which are used to hedge interest rate risk  guarantees by us of trust preferred securities issued by separately created  unconsolidated trusts  a contingent liability under an amendment made to afp s management agreement with pri  effective january   and an irrevocable letter of credit issued in favor of the lessor under an operating lease 
fpic uses interest rate collars as a hedge to maintain the total borrowing costs of its long term debt interest expense on the debt instruments  plus or minus cash flows under the interest rate collar instruments to within specified ranges 
fpic s all in borrowing costs on long term debt combined with the corresponding cash flows under the related interest rate collars can fluctuate between million to million annually  until such time as the interest rate collars expire 
the interest rate collars are set to expire on dates corresponding with the first dates under the respective long term debt agreements at which they can be retired by us at our option  which is five years from the date of issue in each case 
fpic also had interest rate swaps in effect as hedging instruments for the adjustable rate interest obligations under its former bank credit facility 
during  the bank credit facility was retired and the related remaining portions of the interest rate swap agreements were settled 
as a result  charges of approximately million in aggregate were recognized in  of which million was recognized in the fourth quarter of see note  derivative financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures about fpic s derivative financial instruments 
fpic guarantees the floating rate interest and principal obligations under the trust preferred securities issued by its separately created  unconsolidated trusts  which have been established solely for the purpose of issuing the securities 
the total principal balance of these trust preferred securities was million as of december  fpic also carries corresponding junior subordinated debentures on its balance sheet  which debentures were issued to these trusts in exchange for the proceeds raised by the trusts upon their respective issuances of the trust preferred securities 
the junior subordinated debentures of fpic are comprised of the same maturities  floating interest rates and other applicable terms and are the instruments by which fpic funds the related interest and principal obligations of the unconsolidated trusts 
see note  long term debt  revolving credit facility and term loan  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures about fpic s trusts and junior subordinated debentures 
afp has a year management agreement with pri  under which it receives a management fee annually equal to of pri s direct premiums written 
the current term of the management agreement runs through december  under the terms of the management agreement  afp receives this fee in exchange for performing services necessary to conduct and manage the entire operation of pri 
the agreement was amended by afp and pri to remove the sharing by afp of of pri s statutory net income or loss  effective january  with regard to profit sharing amounts already earned and collected  afp has agreed to hold the years  and open for re determination and possible adjustment for a period of five years each expiring  and  respectively 
such adjustments would be based primarily on development of and related adjustments  if any  to loss and lae reserves for those years 
afp has earned and collected profit sharing amounts under the original agreement totaling million for the three years ended december  as of december   and based on pri s operating results  no amounts were payable under this provision of the amended management agreement

fpic has issued an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of  as collateral under the operating lease for the building occupied by afp and pri in manhasset  new york 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about this irrevocable letter of credit 
in addition to the above mentioned letter of credit  fpic issues irrevocable letters of credit or places assets in trust under its assumed reinsurance contracts with pri 
these assets in trust or letters of credit serve as collateral to corresponding insurance liabilities recorded on our balance sheet and are not considered to be off balance sheet obligations 
in addition  fpic is contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating and capital lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional information regarding these obligations is provided in note  long term debt  revolving credit facility and term loan and note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below does not include contractual obligations with respect to our employee benefit plans  which are described more fully in note  employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements 
payment due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total stock repurchase plans under our stock repurchase program  we may repurchase shares at such times  and in such amounts  as management deems appropriate 
we did not repurchase any shares during the year and a total of  shares remain available to be repurchased under the program 
on november   we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility and retired the credit facility 
we are therefore no longer subject to the credit facility s covenants and restrictions  including the previous restrictions on stock repurchases 
however  under certain circumstances  limitations are placed on fpic s ability to purchase its capital stock by the terms of agreements relating to its junior subordinated debentures 
for information regarding these limitations  refer to note  long term debt  revolving credit facility and term loan to the consolidated financial statements 
for additional information  see also the discussion of liquidity and capital resources  below 
liquidity and capital resources the payment of losses and lae  insurance operating expenses including reinsurance costs  claims administration and management expenses  non insurance operating expenses  interest expense and income taxes in the ordinary course of business and the repayment of debt and assignment of collateral are the principal needs for our liquid funds 
the principal sources of cash from our operations to meet our on going liquidity requirements are the premiums collected for the insurance sold by our insurance subsidiaries  income on the investment of those funds  and claims administration and management fees and reinsurance brokerage and other commission income earned by our non insurance subsidiaries 
net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations has been sufficient during each of the three years in the period ended december   to meet our liquidity needs 
as reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows  we generated positive net cash from operating activities of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and held fixed maturity debt securities with a fair value of approximately million with scheduled maturities during the next twelve months 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of december   combined with cash flows from operating activities and the scheduled maturities of investments in  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for operating purposes for at least the next twelve months 
our net cash flows from operating activities during the last three years  and in particular  during and  grew to high levels relative to our historical operating cash flows mainly as the result of unprecedented growth in our insurance business in terms of both increased numbers of mpl policyholders and pricing improvements 
as a result of growth management initiatives we have implemented  we do not expect to sustain net cash flows from operating activities at the levels achieved in and a number of factors could cause unexpected changes in liquidity and capital resources available  including but not limited to the following i unexpected changes in premium revenue due to higher or lower than expected new business or retention of insurance policies in force  ii unexpected changes in the amounts needed to defend and settle claims  iii unexpected changes in operating costs  including new or increased taxes  iv failure of one or more of our reinsurers leading to uncollectible reinsurance recoverables  v possible impairments of our long term investments  and vi unexpected changes in liquidity provided by our reciprocal management and tpa segments 
furthermore  liquidity and capital risks can come about as the result of the broader business and financial risks facing us including the uncertainties and factors disclosed in the safe harbor disclosure 
many  if not most of these types of uncertainties  could have a corresponding and materially negative effect on our liquidity and capital resources  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
in order to compensate for such risk  we i maintain what management considers to be adequate capital and reinsurance  ii monitor our reserves and regularly perform actuarial reviews of loss and lae reserves  and iii attempt to maintain adequate asset diversification and liquidity by managing our cash flow from operations coupled with the maturities from our fixed income portfolio investments 
long term debt during  we completed the placement of million in senior notes and created three trusts that issued year trust preferred securities for which the proceeds from such issuances together with cash previously contributed to the trusts were used to purchase junior subordinated debentures from fpic totaling million 
we used the proceeds along with other internally generated funds to retire our bank term loan and revolving credit facility  make a capital contribution to our insurance operations and unwind hedge agreements related to the revolving credit facility and term loan 
we established three wholly owned  but not consolidated  trusts  fpic capital trust i  fpic capital statutory trust ii and fpic capital statutory trust iii for the sole purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities 
the proceeds received by the three trusts were used to purchase junior subordinated debentures from fpic of the same amounts  maturities and other applicable terms and features 
the debentures issued by fpic  which are reported as long term debt in the consolidated statements of financial position  to the three trusts are subordinated to all senior indebtedness  including the senior notes  and are equal in standing to one another 
the securities are uncollateralized and bear a floating interest rate equal to the three month libor plus a spread ranging from to the floating interest rates ranged from to as of december  
the floating interest rate will be adjustable quarterly with changes in the three month libor  and in the case of the first two offerings  the maximum rate that may be charged under the securities within the first five years is 
we have also purchased hedging instruments designed to maintain the ultimate floating rate interest cost on all of these securities within a stated range for five years from closing 
we have the option to call the trust preferred securities at par or its equivalent beginning five years from closing 
the trust preferred securities also contain features that allow us the option  under certain conditions  to defer interest payments for up to quarters and to redeem the securities before the first optional call date in five years 
in the case of the potential earlier call date  the redemption or call price payable by us may be different than par 
the securities have stated maturities of thirty years and are due in may and october issuance costs for all three offerings in the aggregate amount of approximately million were capitalized and will be amortized over their respective stated maturity periods of thirty years 
in addition  hedge agreements were purchased that effectively place floors and caps on the three month libor floating interest of approximately to and to  respectively  on notional principal corresponding with the principal amounts of each offering  for years 
these instruments will effectively serve to hedge our total floating interest rate borrowing costs under the securities to within a range of to for five years and until such time that we have the right to call the securities 
the initial costs of the hedge instruments acquired for this purpose of million  in aggregate  have been capitalized and will be amortized over their respective five year maturity periods 
retirement of bank credit facility the net proceeds from the trust preferred securities and senior notes  the application of liquid collateral previously set aside under the terms of our bank debt  and other internally generated funds were used to fully pay down and ultimately retire our bank credit facility and related interest rate swap agreements in the fourth quarter of among the internally generated funds used were the proceeds from the sale of fpic s interest in aps 
we completed the sale of our investment in aps  at a small gain  to that company s majority shareholder on october   and received the total consideration of million in cash 
with the repayment and retirement of the bank credit facility  fpic and its subsidiaries have been released from the corresponding liens on their assets that served as collateral under the bank credit facility and from their respective guarantee agreements 
we are also no longer subject to the bank credit facility s covenants and restrictions 
holding company fpic insurance group  inc sources of liquidity the sources of liquidity to fpic  the holding company  for the payment of its operating expenses  taxes and debt related expenses are management fees from first professionals and apac  effective january   overhead allocations to the non insurance subsidiaries for which fpic receives reimbursement and dividends from subsidiaries 
fpic has management agreements with first professionals and  effective january   apac  under which it provides substantially all management and administrative services to these subsidiaries 
the management agreement with apac replaces the former management agreement between apac and apam  which expired as of december  under the terms of the agreements  fpic receives management fees equal to of the costs incurred to manage the two subsidiaries 
the additional provision in the first professionals and apac management fees is intended to cover overhead  corporate expenses and profit and is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
in the case of the new agreement with apac  the total annual management fees are also to be limited to an amount not to exceed those that would have been paid under the terms of its former management agreement with apam 
dividends from subsidiaries 
shareholder dividends available from our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain limitations imposed by florida and missouri laws 
as of december   the insurance subsidiaries are permitted  within insurance regulatory guidelines  to pay fpic dividends of approximately million during without prior regulatory approval 
the national association of insurance commissioners has developed risk based capital rbc measurements for insurers  which have been adopted by the florida and missouri departments of insurance

in may  the fasb issued fas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
the issuer will be required to classify as liabilities three types of freestanding financial instruments  which are mandatory redeemable financial instruments  obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets  and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares 
fas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we have reviewed fas and complied with the reporting requirements therein for the period ended december  adopting the provisions of fas did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r or the interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as variable interest entities vies 
fin r is the guidance that determines whether consolidation is required under the controlling financial interest model of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  or b other existing authoritative guidance  or  alternatively  whether the variable interest model under fin r should be used to account for existing and new entities 
we have adopted fin r 
the result of adoption was the deconsolidation of the three trusts that we created during in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities 
this resulted in offsetting increases in other assets and long term debt of approximately million each

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market and economic conditions  such as changes in interest rates  spreads among various asset classes  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how we managed those exposures as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of all our investment securities as of december  was approximately million 
our investment portfolio was invested primarily in fixed maturity securities  which comprised million  or  of the fair value of all our investment securities 
the fixed maturity portfolio currently maintains an average moody s credit quality of aa aa 
we invest in securities with investment grade credit ratings  with the intent to minimize credit risks 
approximately of the fixed income portfolio is invested in securities rated aaa or its equivalent by investment rating services  is aa  is a  and is bbb 
we purchased collateralized mortgage obligations in the context of our overall investment and asset class allocation strategy and  specifically  to help improve our yields and current income 
approximately of our fixed income portfolio is allocated to the municipal sector in the form of tax exempt securities 
the balance is diversified through investments in treasury  agency  and corporate and mortgage backed securities 
generally  we do not invest in derivatives and do not currently use hedging strategies in our investment portfolio 
however  we do have investments in hedging instruments designed to maintain the ultimate floating rate interest cost on the mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities and senior notes within a stated range 
the four market risks that can most directly affect the investment portfolio are changes in us interest rates  credit risks  prepayment risks  and legislative changes  including changes in tax laws that might affect the taxation of our investment securities 
from time to time  discussion arises in the united states congress relative to changing or modifying the tax exempt status of municipal securities 
we stay abreast of possible legislative acts that could adversely affect the tax exempt status of municipal securities 
at present there are no hedging or other strategies being used to minimize this risk 
however  we have also reduced our concentration in tax exempt municipal securities during and relative to tax exempt holdings in and prior  as part of our overall investment strategy 
we manage risks associated with the changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the duration of our investments in relation to the duration of our anticipated liabilities principally claim payments and related defense costs in such a way so as to minimize the likelihood of having to liquidate investments at a loss before their maturity 
effective duration is a standard measure of interest rate sensitivity that takes into account  among other things  the effect that changing interest rates will have on prepayments and the re investment of these funds 
the effective duration of our consolidated fixed income investment portfolio as of december  was years 
the following table summarizes the effects on the estimated fair value of our fixed income portfolio assuming a range of increases and decreases in market interest rates 
for purposes of this interest rate analysis  each market interest rate change is assumed to be uniform across the portfolio 
as shown in this table  if prevailing market interest rates on investments in debt securities comparable to those we held as of december  were to uniformly increase or basis points  the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would have decreased approximately million or million  respectively 
dollar amounts are shown in thousands 
hypothetical decrease bps hypothetical decrease bps current market hypothetical increase bps hypothetical increase bps fair value fair value reported value computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
the following table presents the projected cash flows for our assets and liabilities associated with financial instruments and operating leases 
it does not reflect operating cash flows  including investment income and interest expense earned or accrued as expense under these instruments 
thus  the amounts reported as cash flows in the table below for fixed maturities represent par values at maturity date  and exclude investment income and expenses and other cash flows 
the fair values of fixed maturities are based upon quoted market prices or dealer quotes for comparable securities 
the fair value of the interest rate collars is estimated using quotes from the financial institution that acted as the broker in obtaining them and represents the cash requirement if the existing agreement had been settled at year end 
the projected cash flows of long term debt and operating leases are estimated to approximate their fair values as of december  interest expense on debt is excluded from this table as is interest income on investments 
however  weighted average interest rates earned on our fixed income securities and interest expense on our long term debt are presented in the last section of the table 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates 
projected cash flows in thousands thereafter total december  fair value assets fixed maturity securities  available for sale interest rate collars liabilities long term debt operating leases weighted average interest rate fixed maturity securities interest rate collars long term debt
