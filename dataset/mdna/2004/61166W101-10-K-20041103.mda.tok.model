competition the global markets for our products are highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify with the continued development and commercialization of new technologies and products  including biotechnology traits 
we compete with numerous multinational companies globally and with hundreds of companies regionally 
most of our seed competitors are also licensees of our germplasm and or biotechnology traits 
in certain countries  we also compete with government owned seed companies 
growers who save seed from one year to the next also affect competitive conditions 
product performance in particular  crop yield  customer service  intellectual property and price are important elements of market success 
in addition  distributor  retailer and grower relationships have been important in the united states and many other countries 
our traits compete as a system with agricultural chemicals and  to lesser degree  traits developed by other companies 
other agrichemical and seed marketers produce chemical and seed products that compete with our roundup ready and insect control systems 
competition for the discovery of new agricultural traits based on biotechnology and or genomics is likely to come from major global agrichemical companies  state funded programs and academic institutions 
enabling technologies may also come from academic researchers and an array of biotechnology research companies 
the primary factors underlying the competitive success of traits are performance and commercial viability  timeliness of introduction  value  governmental approvals  public acceptance  and environmental characteristics 
competitive success in crop protection products depends on price  product performance  the quality of solutions offered to growers  market coverage  and the service provided to distributors  retailers and growers 
we have five to major global competitors for our agricultural herbicide products 
competition from local or regional companies may also be significant

raw materials and energy resources we are a significant purchaser of basic and intermediate raw materials 
our major raw materials and energy requirements are typically purchased through long term contracts 
we do not depend on any one outside supplier for a significant amount of any raw material requirements  but a few major suppliers provide us certain important raw materials 
the markets for many key raw materials are extremely tight and forecasted to remain so for the next few years 
although some additional capacity does exist  pricing is substantially higher than under current contracts 
energy is available as required  but pricing is subject to market fluctuations from time to time

table of contents monsanto company form k activities of foreign affiliates during an internal audit and follow up review conducted by management and outside counsel  management learned of certain books and records and compliance irregularities involving the company s indonesian affiliate companies and certain of their foreign national employees 
the employment of those employees involved in the irregularities has been terminated 
monsanto notified the sec of this matter on nov 
  and thereafter provided a full report of its internal review to the sec  with a copy to the us department of justice 
on march   monsanto announced that the department of justice had advised monsanto that its investigation had expanded to include an inquiry into whether a former outside consultant made an improper  payment to an indonesian government official in early at the direction of a former monsanto employee

environmental proceedings since the late s  the us environmental protection agency epa has identified more than sites as potential sources of dioxin in the kanawha river in west virginia 
in may  the epa sent monsanto  as well as solutia  a notice of potential liability and offer to negotiate for removal action regarding the kanawha river site in putnam and kanawha counties  west virginia  which was premised on pharmacia s former operations at its nitro  west virginia  manufacturing facility 
pharmacia  solutia and monsanto have all been in communication with the epa regarding the notice and offer 
monsanto believes that the kanawha river site is the responsibility of solutia under the terms of the distribution agreement between pharmacia and solutia relating to solutia s spinoff  however  prior to solutia s chapter filing  solutia refused to accept responsibility for this matter 
in order to mitigate damages and protect the rights and positions of monsanto and pharmacia  monsanto has been managing this matter on behalf of pharmacia and will make a claim for recovery against solutia in the course of its bankruptcy proceeding 
the epa  monsanto and pharmacia have negotiated a consent order under which monsanto is preparing an engineering evaluation cost analysis report  which will contain the results of our investigation of dioxin contamination in the kanawha river  the sources of such contamination  an evaluation of removal options  and a recommended approach to removing or otherwise addressing the contaminated sediments 
the degree to which monsanto  solutia and pharmacia  as opposed to third parties  could ultimately be responsible for costs associated with this matter is unclear 
pharmacia is party to several epa administrative orders that require investigation and remediation activities in and around sauget  illinois 
in connection with its chapter filing bankruptcy  solutia ceased performing under these orders on pharmacia s behalf 
monsanto therefore has stepped in on pharmacia s behalf and is performing pharmacia s obligations under those administrative orders 
we anticipate that work will continue under these administrative orders through  after which we expect epa to issue a record of decision identifying further remedial activities

pharmacia has rejected monsanto s tender 
proceedings relating to solutia s assumed liabilities as described above  solutia managed and directed the defense of proceedings with respect to solutia s assumed liabilities until approximately feb

table of contents monsanto company form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background monsanto company is a leading global provider of agricultural products and integrated solutions for farmers 
we produce leading seed brands  including dekalb and asgrow  and we develop biotechnology traits that assist farmers in controlling insects and weeds 
we provide other seed companies with genetic material and biotechnology traits for their seed brands 
we also make roundup herbicide and other herbicides 
our seeds  related biotechnology trait products and herbicides can be combined to provide growers with integrated solutions that improve productivity and reduce the costs of farming 
we also provide lawn and garden herbicide products for the residential market and animal agricultural products focused on improving dairy cow productivity and swine genetics 
we manage our business in two segments seeds and genomics  and agricultural productivity 
the seeds and genomics segment consists of the global seeds and related traits businesses  and genetic technology platforms 
the agricultural productivity segment consists of the crop protection products  animal agriculture  lawn and garden herbicide products  and environmental technologies businesses 
more than percent of our sales  percent of our seeds and genomics segment s sales  and percent of our agricultural productivity segment s sales were made outside the united states during fiscal year in october  we announced plans to exit the european breeding and seed business for wheat and barley and to discontinue the plant made pharmaceuticals program 
as a result of the exit plans  these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations 
accordingly  for fiscal year  the eight months ended aug 
  and calendar years ended dec 
 and  the statement of consolidated operations has been conformed to this presentation 
in the fourth quarter of  we finalized the sale of assets associated with our european wheat and barley business

financial measures the primary operating performance measure for our two business segments is earnings loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change  interest and income taxes ebit 
we believe that ebit is useful to investors and management to demonstrate the operational profitability of our segments by excluding interest and income taxes  which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis 
ebit is also one of the measures used by monsanto management in determining resource allocations within the company 
we also provide information regarding free cash flow  an important liquidity measure for monsanto 
we define free cash flow as the total of net cash provided or required by operations and provided or required by investing activities 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash 
this cash can be used to meet business needs and obligations  to reinvest into the company for future growth  or to return to our shareowners through dividend payments or share repurchases 
free cash flow is also used by management as one of the performance measures in determining incentive compensation 
the presentation of ebit and free cash flow information is intended to supplement investors understanding of our operating performance and liquidity 
our ebit and free cash flow measures may not be comparable to other companies ebit and free cash flow measures 
furthermore  these measures are not intended to replace net income loss  cash flows  financial position  or comprehensive income loss  as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
executive summary consolidated operating results net sales increased percent to billion in fiscal year from billion in the comparable month period 
sales increased percent  or million  in the seeds and genomics segment and percent  or million  in the agricultural productivity segment 
we experienced sales improvements in corn and soybean traits in the united states  corn seed in the united states  europe and brazil  and cotton traits in the united states and india 
sales of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides increased in all world areas outside the united states 
despite somewhat higher volumes  mix continued to shift to lower priced glyphosate products and market share declined in our us glyphosate business in line with our expectations 
consistent with results for the comparable month period  the gross profit contribution of our seeds and genomics segment surpassed the gross profit contribution of our glyphosate business 
fiscal operating expenses increased percent  or million  and were driven by higher selling  general and administrative expenses  net restructuring charges  and a goodwill impairment 
see the restructuring and other special items section of md a  which outlines the fiscal year restructuring program and related goodwill impairment 
in the comparable month period  we participated in a global settlement  which included solutia and pharmacia  relating to certain polychlorinated biphenyl pcb litigation in alabama 
this global settlement resulted in a million pretax net expense 
fiscal year net income of million  or per share  improved from million  or per share  in the comparable month period 
for further details  see the results of operations  seeds and genomics segment  and agricultural productivity segment sections of md a 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources as of aug 
  the balance of cash and cash equivalents was more than billion 
in fiscal year  we contributed million toward the pcb litigation settlement  purchased million of our shares  and made million in voluntary pension contributions 
for fiscal year  net cash provided by operations was  million  compared with  million in the comparable prior year period 
net cash required by investing activities was million in and million in the comparable month period 
as a result  our free cash flow as defined in the financial measures section above was million in fiscal year compared with million in the comparable month period 
the increase in free cash flow was driven by improved trade accounts receivable collections globally and the timing of short term investments  which were partially offset by the pcb litigation settlement payment net of pcb insurance proceeds and higher voluntary pension contributions in fiscal year total debt outstanding remained consistent between aug 
  and aug 
  at approximately billion 
see the financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources section of md a for a more detailed discussion 
outlook we are continuing to evolve to a company led by its strengths in seeds and biotechnology traits as a means of delivering solutions to our customers 
we aim to continually improve our products to maintain market leadership and to 
table of contents monsanto company form k support near term performance 
we are focused on solving problems in new ways for farmers and bringing second generation traits to the market  such as bollgard ii  and pipeline products in advanced stages  such as roundup ready flex cotton 
we are also focused on providing farmers with multiple solutions in one seed  or stacking more than one trait in a seed 
our second generation products are being introduced before the competition has delivered its first generation products 
our capabilities in biotechnology research are generating a rich product pipeline that is expected to drive long term growth 
we aspire to bring new solutions to our customers unmet needs  for example crops with improved oil and protein composition and drought tolerant crops 
the viability of our product pipeline depends in part on the speed of regulatory approvals globally 
as a key determinant of our ability to launch new products  we have focused on aspects of the process we can control 
this has resulted in programs such as the brazil value capture system  which makes it possible to collect a royalty on our roundup ready soybean invention even though the longer term regulatory system there is still evolving 
concurrent to this activity in the seeds and genomics segment  we are focused on reducing the costs associated with our agricultural chemistry business as that sector matures globally 
roundup remains the market leader  however  the mix of our glyphosate products reflects the increased competitive dynamics of the marketplace 
we are required to indemnify pharmacia for solutia s assumed liabilities  to the extent that solutia fails to pay  perform or discharge those liabilities 
prior to and following its filing for bankruptcy protection  solutia has disclaimed responsibility for solutia s assumed liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that our obligation to indemnify pharmacia for solutia s assumed liabilities could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  profitability and or liquidity  however  that effect cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
see item legal proceedings and item note commitments and contingencies for further details 
refer to the outlook section of md a for a more detailed discussion of the opportunities  challenges and risks we have identified for our business 
in october  we announced that return on capital would be a new financial measure for fiscal year we intend to improve return on capital through continued optimization of the roundup business while accelerating the seeds and traits businesses 
additionally  we expect our compounded annual earnings per share growth rate to somewhat increase in fiscal year from the fiscal year earnings per share base  excluding for both years restructuring charges  the goodwill impairment and discontinued operations 
we expect the earnings per share growth to be driven by greater acreage penetration of biotech traits  the use of more than one trait per acre  and pricing flexibility in our global seeds and traits businesses 
the factors described in the cautionary statements risk factors regarding forward looking statements section of md a represent continuing risks to this expectation

we experienced sales growth in both segments 
our seeds and genomics segment net sales improved percent  and sales for our agricultural productivity segment increased percent 
ideal weather conditions in almost every world area in fiscal year contributed to the sales improvements for both segments 
sales of corn  soybean and cotton traits in the united states  and corn seed in the united states  europe and brazil drove the seeds and genomics segment net sales increase 
sales of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides increased in all world areas outside the united states  with brazil providing the largest contribution to the fiscal year sales increase 
the agricultural productivity segment was negatively affected by a sizable sales decline of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides in the united states because of a mix shift to lower tier glyphosate products and a market share decline of several share points in line with our expectations 
for a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting the net sales comparison  see the seeds and genomics segment and the agricultural productivity segment sections 
gross profit increased percent in fiscal year  which was consistent with the percent net sales increase 
total company gross profit as a percentage of sales was percent for both month periods 
consistent with the results of the months ended aug 
  gross profit of our seeds and genomics segment in surpassed the gross profit contribution of our glyphosate business 
we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year and beyond 
restructuring expenses recorded in cost of goods sold totaled million in fiscal year and million in the comparable prior year period 
restructuring charges had a percentage point effect on gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal year  and had no effect on gross profit as a percent of sales in the prior year month period 

table of contents monsanto company form k gross profit as a percent of sales increased percentage points for the seeds and genomics segment to percent  and declined percentage points for the agricultural productivity segment to percent in fiscal year the strength of our seeds and genomics segment more than offset the decline in our glyphosate business 
gross profit as a percent of sales for the seeds and genomics segment improved because of higher average net selling price for branded corn seed  particularly in the united states  and lower us cost of goods sold due to improved corn yields for seed production 
additionally  gross profit improved from stacking more than one biotech trait in corn and increased corn trait penetration 
gross profit also benefited from an increase in roundup ready soybean trait prices in the united states 
the decline in agricultural productivity gross profit as a percent of sales was primarily because of the us mix shift to lower priced roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides and a us market share decline of several share points  both of which were in line with our expectations 
operating expenses increased percent  or million  in fiscal year from the prior year comparable period 
we experienced increases in each of the five expense line items that are part of operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased percent  or million  for the month comparison 
the largest driver of the sg a expense increase was higher accrued incentive compensation 
these accrued incentive levels are commensurate with our improved operational results this year 
sg a expenses also increased because of higher expense associated with the institution of a royalty system for roundup ready soybeans in brazil see outlook in md a for additional details  and higher agency fee expense as a result of increased fiscal year net sales for the lawn and garden herbicide business compared with the same period in the prior year 
as discussed in the restructuring and other special items section of md a  we estimated approximately million in fiscal aftertax savings as a result of the fiscal year restructuring plan 
these savings benefited sg a  and  to a lesser extent  research and development expenses 
the sg a savings primarily resulted from the restructuring actions in europe  and were nearly offset by the unfavorable effect of exchange rates on european sg a expenses in as a percent of net sales  sg a expenses including bad debt expense were percent in both month periods 
bad debt expense increased percent  or million  in fiscal year compared with the same period a year ago 
we recorded million in higher bad debt expense from the same period a year ago for exposures related to potential uncollectible argentine accounts receivable 
lower bad debt expenses in europe somewhat offset the increase 
in fiscal year  we continued to restructure our argentine business model 
this redesign focused on streamlining distribution  improving working capital management  and rationalizing our product portfolio 
these changes  coupled with the continued economic and business challenges  led to increased credit exposure 
we increased the allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables in argentina after performing a thorough review of our past due trade receivables 
although we cannot determine with certainty how government actions and economic conditions in argentina will affect the value of net receivables outstanding  we continue to pursue customer collections aggressively to minimize exposure 
the increase in argentine bad debt expense also included a reserve for trade receivables related to two minor crops that were exited during fiscal  an action which has resulted in a lower probability of collection 
fiscal year also had higher argentine bad debt expense incurred in the normal course of business 
research and development r d expenses increased percent  or million  in fiscal year from the comparable prior year period 
higher employee related costs and expenses associated with a third party software license were the largest drivers of the fiscal increase 
as a percent of net sales  r d expenses decreased percentage point to percent in fiscal year in fiscal year  we recognized a million noncash pretax million aftertax goodwill adjustment related to our global wheat business 
our decision to exit the european wheat business required us to re evaluate the goodwill related to the wheat reporting unit for impairment 
restructuring charges net were recorded in both month periods 
restructuring charges recorded in for the fiscal year restructuring plan were million  which were reduced by million of restructuring reversals related to our prior restructuring plans 
during the prior year comparable period  we recognized million of restructuring charges in operating expenses related to our restructuring plan 
these restructuring charges were offset by million of restructuring reversals related to the and restructuring plans 
thus  net restructuring charges were million in fiscal year and million in the comparable prior year period 
for a further discussion  see the restructuring and other special items section of md a 
interest expense net decreased million in fiscal year to million 
interest expense increased million in fiscal year to million  primarily because we had a higher average amount of variable rate medium term notes in brazil 
table of contents monsanto company form k outstanding in fiscal year compared with the comparable month period 
we issued approximately million of additional medium term notes in brazil in fiscal see item note debt and other credit arrangements for further details 
interest income increased million in fiscal year to million because of larger overnight cash deposits  which resulted from improved operational cash flow in the united states and brazil 
further  interest income increased million in from the accretion of the discount related to the pcb insurance receivables see the following paragraph 
we recorded million of pcb litigation settlement expense net in the prior year month period 
the pretax charge of million million aftertax  reflecting a tax benefit of million was recorded in august the net charge includes million of related legal expenses 
in august  we participated in a global settlement  which included solutia and pharmacia  relating to certain solutia pcb litigation in alabama 
our strong cash generating capabilities allowed us to contribute to this settlement  thereby mitigating the longer term litigation risk associated with our contractual obligations related to solutia 
we paid a portion million of our share of the cash settlement in august  and the remaining million was paid in september we recorded miscellaneous receivables of million as of aug 
  for the anticipated insurance reimbursement from pharmacia s commercial insurance  however  this amount was adjusted by increasing other expense net by million in fiscal to reflect the discounted effect as a result of the three year payment schedule to which we agreed million was accreted to interest income in fiscal  and an additional million will be accreted in future periods 
in august  we and the insurer responsible for approximately million of the reimbursement resolved the mediation of a dispute regarding the amount due and we received net proceeds of million in august miscellaneous receivables of million remain recorded as of aug 
  for the anticipated insurance reimbursement million was recorded in miscellaneous receivables and million was recorded in other assets 
the insurer agreed to pay the remainder in quarterly installments over three calendar years beginning in march in consideration of our participation in the settlement  solutia agreed to issue warrants to us for the purchase of million shares of solutia stock 
solutia did not execute a final warrant agreement or issue or deliver the warrants prior to its chapter filing in december  and monsanto expects that solutia s obligation to issue warrants will be discharged in the chapter proceeding 
monsanto has not recorded the warrants in its financial statements  in either period  because they were not received 
other expense net increased million during fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded million million aftertax for the advancement of funds to pay for solutia s assumed liabilities in light of solutia s refusal to pay for those liabilities and for legal and other expenses related to the solutia bankruptcy 
see item note commitments and contingencies for further details on solutia s assumed liabilities 
additionally  other expenses were higher in fiscal year because of increased hedging losses and foreign currency transaction losses 
hedging losses were million in fiscal compared to hedging gains of million in the comparable month period 
net foreign currency transaction losses increased million to million 
we recognized million of other income during fiscal year related to gains that were realized upon the sale of equity securities 
our equity affiliate expense decreased million to million in fiscal year  and was primarily related to our renessen llc renessen joint venture 
renessen expenses declined in because of lower payroll costs as a result of a reorganization that occurred in the prior year  and improved cost management 
this joint venture is owned and funded with cargill  incorporated 
it was formed to develop and market products for the grain processing and animal feed industries 
income tax provision for fiscal year increased million from the prior year comparable period 
the effective tax rate increased to percent  an increase of percent over the comparable month period 
the goodwill adjustment in fiscal year and the pcb litigation settlement in the prior year significantly affected the effective tax rate comparison 
without the goodwill adjustment  the effective tax rate would have been percent  and without the pcb litigation settlement  the effective tax rate would have been percent 
thus  without these items  the effective tax rate would have been a reduction of percent versus the prior year period 
this improvement was driven primarily by a favorable adjustment to our income tax reserve resulting from a settlement reached with the internal revenue service on a number of issues and  to a lesser extent  a realignment of the company s european business operations 
income tax expense for also includes two adjustments for valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets in argentina and brazil 
in argentina  we established a valuation allowance of million primarily as a result of the recent history of losses  the continued uncertain economic conditions in argentina discussed in the outlook section of md a and the limited tax carryforward period of five years 
in brazil  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance and reversed the existing valuation allowance of million  primarily as a result of the improved operating results in brazil and the improvements in the brazilian 
table of contents monsanto company form k economy 
for further details of these deferred tax adjustments  please refer to the critical accounting policies and estimates section of md a and item note income taxes 
as discussed in note  the sale of the european wheat and barley business generated a tax loss deductible in either the united kingdom or the united states 
as of aug 
  a deferred tax asset had not been recorded for the tax loss incurred in the united states because of the existence of a number of uncertainties 
these uncertainties were substantially diminished with the enactment of the american jobs creation act of on oct 
 as a result  we will record a deferred tax benefit of approximately million  or per share  in the first quarter of fiscal year the recognition of this tax benefit in the united states will effectively preclude monsanto from claiming any uk benefit for the uk tax loss 
accordingly  the uk deferred tax asset of million  which had a full valuation allowance against it  will be written off 
the american jobs creation act of also contains a number of tax provisions which we are in the process of evaluating their impact 
while management does not believe these provisions will have a material impact on fiscal year  they may have a material impact in subsequent years 
the factors above explain the change in income from continuing operations 
the loss on discontinued operations was million in fiscal year and million in the same period a year ago 
the aftertax loss of million included million related to restructuring charges recorded in discontinued operations and a million loss from operations of the discontinued businesses 
sg a and r d expenses related to the discontinued businesses were lower in fiscal year than in the comparable period a year ago because we were exiting those businesses 
fiscal also included a benefit from the write off of a deferred tax liability of million associated with the european wheat and barley business 
pretax restructuring expenses of million offset the lower expenses and tax benefit 
additionally  in the months ended aug 
  we adopted a new accounting standard relating to asset retirement obligations  which negatively affected our net income by million aftertax  or per share 
overview of financial performance transition period compared with eight months ended aug 
 we recognized a net loss of million during the transition period  and a net loss of billion during the comparable prior year period 
the following factors affected the eight month comparison an aftertax charge of million in related to the settlement of certain solutia pcb litigation an aftertax charge of million effective jan 
  upon adoption of a new accounting standard relating to asset retirement obligations a billion aftertax transitional goodwill impairment charge  upon adoption of a new accounting standard relating to goodwill establishment of a million aftertax  bad debt reserve in related to argentine receivables actions in to reduce risks in latin america  due to economic and market uncertainties  that negatively affected results aftertax charges of million relating to our restructuring plan net of prior plan reversals gain from sales of certain assets for use in certain ex us markets in  which contributed approximately million aftertax of other income on an ongoing business basis  our results in the transition period were affected by lower volumes and lower average net selling prices of roundup herbicides in the united states 
however  stronger sales of our seeds and traits in the united states mitigated this shortfall 
during the transition period  our seeds and genomics segment delivered a greater gross profit 
table of contents monsanto company form k contribution than that of the roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides 
this milestone demonstrates the increasing contribution of that segment to our results

both of our operating segments benefited from improved performance in latin america 
in the eight month period in the prior year  net sales were negatively affected by difficult economic conditions in that region  as well as the operational changes we made to our business to address the uncertainties there 
in the seeds and genomics segment  us seed and trait sales continued their strong growth in the transition period  with seed and trait sales for all crops increasing during the eight month period 
sales in the agricultural productivity segment declined because of the continued shift toward lower priced roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides and lower us roundup volumes in the postpatent glyphosate market 
sales of our selective herbicides also declined 
for a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting the net sales comparison  see seeds and genomics segment and agricultural productivity segment for the transition period 
gross profit for the transition period increased percent  which was consistent with the percent increase in net sales 
increases in seeds and genomics gross profit were partly offset by declines in agricultural productivity gross profit  as the continued growth of our seeds and genomics segment improved our margins in the transition period 
better financial results in latin america also improved the margin comparison in the transition period  as the market factors in latin america and our actions in response to those factors negatively affected our margins in the comparable period in collectively  these items improved the eight month gross profit comparison 
they more than mitigated the effect of the shift in roundup and other glyphosate based herbicide sales in the united states to lower priced products 
during the eight month period  the gross profit of our seeds and genomics segment surpassed the gross profit contribution of our glyphosate business 
as a percent of net sales  gross profit gained one point to percent 
operating expenses decreased percent for the eight month comparison 
in june  we increased our allowance for doubtful trade receivables by million because of the economic turmoil and related market conditions in argentina 
we also recorded million of net operating expenses related to the restructuring plan approved in these and other operating expenses in the prior year eight month period were partially offset by a million reduction in sg a costs 
table of contents monsanto company form k stemming from the sale of certain monsanto herbicide assets in japan to nissan chemical industries nissan 
sg a expenses in the transition period also reflected a reduction  to a lesser extent  in costs related to agreements that are part of our ongoing business 
during the transition period  our bad debt expense was significantly lower  and our operating expenses were reduced by million in restructuring reversals related to our past restructuring plans 
however  higher employee related costs  primarily accrued incentive compensation  drove sg a expenses higher in the transition period 
continued cost management helped offset some of this increase and also decreased r d expenses by percent 
we also continued to see the benefits from our restructuring programs through lower r d expenses 
in august  we participated in a global settlement  which included solutia and pharmacia  relating to certain solutia pcb litigation in alabama 
we paid a portion million of our share of the cash settlement in august  and the remaining million was paid in september we expected to receive approximately million in reimbursement from pharmacia s commercial insurance 
as a result  we recorded a pretax charge of million million aftertax  reflecting a tax benefit of million during the transition period 
the net charge includes million of related legal expenses 
see the fiscal year results of operations discussion in md a for more details of the pcb litigation settlement expense 
other expense net increased to million during the transition period 
net other expense in the transition period consisted primarily of equity affiliate expense and foreign currency transaction losses 
our equity affiliate expense of million is primarily related to our renessen joint venture 
during the eight months ended aug 
  we recorded approximately million of other income related to sales of certain herbicide assets for use in ex us markets  including the nissan transaction in japan and a smaller transaction with nufarm australia ltd 
nufarm in the australia and new zealand markets 
we also recognized million of other income during the eight month period related to gains that were realized upon the sale of equity securities 
these gains were slightly offset by net currency losses reflecting the devaluation of our net assets denominated in argentine pesos 
net interest expense increased million to million during the transition period 
although our debt levels during the transition period were significantly lower than debt levels during the comparable period in  higher interest rates associated with our long term senior notes led to overall higher interest expense 
with the issuance of these notes  our debt mix has shifted from primarily commercial paper toward longer term borrowings  which carry higher interest rates 
we recognized an income tax benefit of million during the transition period on a pretax loss of million 
during the same period in  we recognized an income tax provision of million on million of pretax income 
the solutia pcb litigation settlement expense in and the argentine bad debt expense in significantly affected the eight month effective tax rate comparison 
without these items  the effective tax rate for both eight month periods would have been percent 
the factors above explain the change in income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations was million for the transition period and million in the same period in the prior year 
discontinued operations related to the european wheat and barley business and plant made pharmaceuticals program generated an aftertax loss of million in the eight months ended aug 
  and an aftertax loss of million in the comparable prior year period 
on jan 
  we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  pursuant to which we no longer amortize goodwill 
in connection with the adoption of this new accounting standard  we recognized a transitional goodwill impairment charge of billion aftertax

 net sales income from continuing operations loss on discontinued operations cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net income loss income from continuing operations earnings per share 
table of contents monsanto company form k we recognized a net loss of billion  or per share  in this net loss included a billion aftertax per share goodwill impairment upon the adoption of a new goodwill accounting standard 
in  we recognized net income of million  or per share 
the factors that affected the year to year comparison are discussed below 
net sales declined percent to billion in from billion in sales declined in both the agricultural productivity segment and  to a lesser extent  the seeds and genomics segment 
in the agricultural productivity segment  continued competitive pressures on roundup resulted in us market share loss  and unfavorable weather conditions in key planting regions contributed to lower us sales of roundup 
the effect of a shift in mix to lower priced glyphosate products also lowered us sales of roundup by decreasing the average net selling price 
the seeds and genomics segment experienced higher seed sales in the united states 
higher corn seed sales were partly offset by lower soybean sales 
trait revenues in the united states increased in  even though results included trait sales for more than one season because of our switch in to a royalty payment system for licensed traits in corn and soybeans 
both segments were affected in by economic conditions in latin america including the economic crisis that began in argentina at the end of  by operational changes we made to our business model to address the continued economic uncertainty and unfavorable market conditions there  and by the actions we took in conjunction with our customers in argentina 
although these changes and actions significantly affected both segments ebit through lower sales in latin america and higher product returns in argentina  they were intended to reduce investments in working capital and our credit risk and other exposures in argentina and brazil 
currency losses in argentina also affected earnings in and  to a lesser extent  in in  higher than anticipated returns of corn seed in latin america primarily in brazil negatively affected sales 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors affecting net sales in and  see seeds and genomics segment and agricultural productivity segment 
cost of goods sold declined percent to billion for  reflective of lower sales 
cost of goods sold included million and million of restructuring expenses in and  respectively 
we were able to keep the unit manufacturing costs of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides flat  despite lower roundup production volumes  which led to unfavorable cost of goods sold manufacturing variances 
these costs were offset by cost management efforts and lower raw material and energy prices 
lower seed inventory costs in the united states were offset by higher seed obsolescence in latin america 
the combination of the aforementioned net sales and cost of goods sold factors resulted in an percent decline in gross profit 
as a percent of sales  gross profit declined one point 
the gross profit effect of lower roundup average net selling prices was slightly mitigated by increased sales of higher margin seed traits 
operating expenses in declined percent from  as a significant increase in argentine bad debt expense was offset by the benefit of no longer amortizing goodwill  and by a decline in our expenses 
sg a expenses for declined percent from these lower spending levels reflected cost management  lower employee incentives and other employee related costs  and an approximate million reduction of costs stemming from the nissan transaction in japan 
in  we recorded million of bad debt expense  the majority of which related to estimated uncollectible trade receivables in argentina 
the allowance for doubtful trade receivables included million million aftertax recorded in the second quarter because of the economic turmoil and market conditions in that country 
the remaining bad debt expense in was in line with our historical experience 
r d expenses in decreased percent from  as we continued to focus our spending on seed breeding  plant biotechnology and genomics 
the restructuring of our early genomics programs also contributed to the savings 
operating results in included the positive effect of our adoption of sfas on jan 
 in comparison  we recorded million million  or per share aftertax of amortization and adjustments of goodwill in continuing operations in both and included charges relating to our restructuring plans 
results in included charges for our restructuring plan  and results included charges for our restructuring plan 
net pretax charges including those recorded within cost of goods sold related to our restructuring plans were million in  and million in for further details on both plans  see restructuring and other special items in md a 
interest expense  net of interest income and capitalized interest  declined million in we benefited from lower commercial paper interest rates during most of the year  as well as lower average borrowing levels 
these benefits were 
table of contents monsanto company form k partially offset by higher interest rates associated with our long term senior notes issued in august in  higher interest capitalized on construction million in versus million in reduced net interest expense  primarily associated with the construction of our cama ari  brazil  facility  which was completed in late other expense net in decreased significantly from other expense net in in both periods  other expense included equity affiliate expense of million associated with our renessen joint venture 
both and included gains realized upon the sale of equity securities approximately million in both years 
on a year to year comparison  other expense net was affected by a number of items 
in  these factors included the following currency losses from net assets in argentina  only partially offset by currency gains in brazil  approximately million of other income related to the nissan and nufarm transactions  and other expense related to a settlement of litigation matters with dupont and dupont s pioneer subsidiary 
in  we recognized million of other expense net 
three separate legal matters affected other expense in  resulting in a net charge of million  as described in note other expense net 
in addition to these legal matters  we recognized million of other expense in to reflect the devaluation of the argentine peso  million in impairments of equity investments  and a loss of million related to the early retirement of employee stock ownership plan esop debt 
the effects of these higher expenses in were slightly offset by other income from a deferred payout provision related to a past business divestiture and gains on the sale of equity securities 
income taxes in decreased significantly from  despite an increase in the effective tax rate from percent in to percent in the decline in income taxes was consistent with the lower pretax income in the absence of goodwill amortization had a favorable effect on the effective tax rate in because the majority of our historical goodwill amortization was not deductible for tax purposes 
however  this improvement was more than offset by higher tax expense in certain ex us jurisdictions  particularly in latin america  and an increase in the relative cost of state income taxes 
discontinued operations related to the european breeding and seed business for wheat and barley and the plant made pharmaceuticals program generated an aftertax loss of million in and an aftertax loss of million in the fluctuation was primarily related to goodwill amortization 
we had million in goodwill amortization expense in and no goodwill amortization expense in because fas was effective on jan

table of contents monsanto company form k seeds and genomics financial performance for fiscal year in fiscal year  net sales in the seeds and genomics segment improved percent  or million  and gross profit improved percent  or million  from the comparable prior year period 
the sales increase reflects gains in all crops 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the seeds and genomics segment increased points  to percent  because of higher average net selling prices for branded corn seed  particularly in the united states  and lower us cost of goods sold due to improved corn yields for seed production 
gross profit also improved from stacking more than one biotech trait in corn  increased corn trait penetration  and the roundup ready soybean trait price increase in the united states 
in fiscal  corn seed and trait net sales increased percent  or million  from the comparable month period 
we experienced higher corn seed and trait sales in the united states  and increased corn seed sales in europe and brazil 
the increase in us corn seed was because of stronger market performance and increased average net selling prices 
our branded corn business increased to share points this year  a one point improvement over the prior year 
sales of us corn traits increased primarily because of growth in stacked traits and higher corn trait penetration 
the higher value stacked trait products deliver herbicide tolerance and insect protection in a single seed 
the number of us acres that growers chose to plant with stacked corn traits in has increased significantly 
european corn seed sales increased because of favorable exchange rates  market share gains and a favorable product mix 
overall  corn seed market share in europe increased percentage points with gains in five european countries 
corn seed net sales in brazil increased because of improved market conditions  which included a fiscal year price increase and a mix shift to higher value products in comparison to the month period 
a decrease in brazil s branded corn seed volume because of reduced planted area slightly offset the price and mix upside 
soybean seed and trait net sales increased percent  or million  in fiscal year from the comparable period a year ago 
this increase was primarily driven by a fiscal price increase for roundup ready soybean traits in the united states  which resulted in both higher trait royalties from licensees and branded trait revenues 
to a lesser extent  us licensed trait volumes increased 
these us soybean trait sales increases were somewhat offset by higher marketing program expenses 
we expect to benefit from a price increase in fiscal for roundup ready soybean traits in the united states 
all other crops seed and trait sales increased percent  or million  in fiscal year from the comparable prior year period 
the increase in all other crops was fueled by higher cotton trait revenues in the united states and india 
us cotton trait revenues increased because of higher average net selling prices  a higher percentage of stacked traits in and the introduction of bollgard ii with roundup ready cotton 
fiscal year cotton trait revenues in india improved from the comparable period a year ago primarily because of increased acreage planted with bollgard cotton traits 
in the prior year  farmers realized the crop protection benefits of our cotton traits  which were approved in calendar year as a result  more farmers began using or increased the acreage they planted with bollgard traits in ebit for the seeds and genomics segment increased percent in fiscal year from the prior year comparable period primarily because of the year over year gross profit improvement we experienced for corn seed and traits  and soybean and cotton traits  which was almost entirely offset by higher operating expenses 
in addition to improved pricing and stacking as described in this section  the growth of our trait businesses was also linked to our advances in breeding and improvement in the overall quality of our products 
operating expenses increased primarily because of higher sg a expenses and the million global wheat goodwill impairment 
sg a expenses increased because a higher percentage of certain expenses was allocated to this segment in fiscal versus the same period a year ago based on the seeds and genomics segment s increasing contribution to total monsanto operations 
the allocation percentages were changed at the beginning of fiscal our allocation methodology is primarily based on the ratio of sales of the seeds and genomics segment to total monsanto sales  and is consistent with our historical practice 
sg a expenses also increased in fiscal because of higher accrued incentive compensation and higher expenses associated with the institution of a royalty system for roundup ready soybeans in brazil see the outlook section in md a 
to a lesser extent  this segment also had higher r d  restructuring and bad debt expenses in fiscal seeds and genomics financial performance for the transition period sales in the seeds and genomics segment improved more than million  with all crops experiencing gains in seed and trait sales 
the largest gains were in latin america and the united states 
in latin america  seed sales were depressed for the comparable period in the prior year  when we recorded additional return accruals in argentina in response to the contracting market that was affected by that country s economic crisis 
we saw higher corn seed sales and less seed obsolescence there during the transition period 
this lower return and obsolescence experience in the region stemmed from improved market 
table of contents monsanto company form k conditions  coupled with the benefits of the operational changes we instituted in however  the primary sales activity in argentina occurs at the beginning of our new fiscal year in september  when the predominant planting season starts  and is therefore not reflected in the eight month results 
in brazil  the sales season begins during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year which starts in june 
favorable currency effects and strong market performance in europe also contributed to corn seed growth 
our operations in france led the strong performance in that region  delivering a market share gain during the transition period 
continued growth of our stacked corn and cotton traits drove us sales higher 
canola trait revenues also increased in the eight month comparison 
an increasing percentage of our seed sales contain a biotechnology trait  demonstrating continued growth in demand for our biotechnology products 
us trait acreage continued to experience double digit growth  with particularly strong performance by roundup ready corn and stacked corn and cotton traits 
us corn seed sales also increased 
the quality of monsanto s corn seed portfolio was evidenced by another market share gain on top of the prior year s gain in the united states 
the seeds and genomics segment delivered positive ebit of million for the transition period 
this is a significant improvement over the ebit loss of million in the same period in the prior year 
gross profit as a percent of sales increased percentage points 
although these gains primarily reflected improved latin american operations in the transition period  they also demonstrated the seeds and genomics segment s increased contribution to monsanto s results 
segment ebit for the eight months ended aug 
  included charges for restructuring and additional bad debt expense related to argentine receivables 
the transition period ebit reflected higher sg a expenses  as the effects of higher incentive accruals and other employee related costs were partially offset by reductions in other sg a and r d costs 
seeds and genomics financial performance for calendar year net sales for the seeds and genomics segment declined to billion in sales in latin america were negatively affected by the adverse market and economic conditions described below 
the latin american net sales decline was partially offset by strong us sales and market performance of our branded corn seed 
trait revenues also increased from to  despite the fact that trait revenues included an additional per share from a timing change in revenue recognition 
grower acceptance of our biotechnology traits continued to rise  as demonstrated by the growth in total acres planted with our traits 
in  we estimated that acreage planted with monsanto s technology traits grew by percent in the united states and by percent globally 
also contributing to the increased trait revenues was the benefit and growth of new agreements with key licensees 
seeds and genomics segment results in were significantly affected by events in latin america 
in  we changed our business model in latin america in order to reduce working capital levels and reduce our credit risk and exposure in argentina and brazil as a result of the continued economic uncertainty in that region 
results were also affected by adverse market conditions in and in argentina  we experienced approximately million of higher than anticipated seed returns primarily corn seed in because of the economic crisis that began at the end of and the flooding in that same year 
in  we experienced approximately million of higher than anticipated returns of high priced corn seed  primarily in brazil 
in  the continued deterioration of the brazilian corn market negatively affected sales 
farmers had switched more land to soybeans because of their lower input costs 
since monsanto has less of a presence in the brazilian soybean market  sales were lower during that period 
our latin american grain sales program also affected the year to year comparison 
results in included approximately million of net sales and related cost of goods sold associated with this program 
during  we changed the way we account for the program to no longer record revenues and cost of goods sold of essentially the same amount 
under the revised program  we no longer take ownership of the grain  thereby eliminating the associated inventory risk 
although this change affects our net sales and cost of goods sold comparison  the effect on the ebit year to year comparison is minimal 
corn seed and corn biotechnology trait revenues in the united states increased  reflecting an increase in planted corn acreage in and strong market performance by our dekalb and asgrow brands during the selling season 
our branded corn seed gained market share in monsanto s roundup ready and yieldgard corn traits both the single trait and the stacked trait versions performed exceptionally well 
a decline in us soybean seed and soybean trait revenues  which stemmed from the reduced planting area  slightly offset these corn seed and trait sales increases 
however  despite the market dynamics of lower acres and an increased supply of seed  our soybean brands maintained their price in  and held most of the market share gains achieved in even though there were fewer planted acres of soybeans in  us soybean 
table of contents monsanto company form k trait revenues in late in preparation for the upcoming season increased as a higher percentage of our branded seed sales contained a biotechnology trait 
seeds and genomics ebit in was a loss of million  an improvement compared with the ebit loss of million 
this ebit improvement was achieved despite an overall decline in sales for the segment 
most of our goodwill relates to our acquired seed businesses  so this segment s ebit benefited from no longer amortizing goodwill in in  this segment s ebit loss included million of goodwill amortization expense 
in  seeds and genomics ebit was negatively affected by a portion of the increase in bad debt expense related to estimated uncollectible accounts receivable in argentina 
lower seed inventory costs in the united states were mostly offset by higher seed obsolescence in latin america 
however  gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 
sales gains in high margin traits more than offset the latin american gross profit declines 
lower operating expenses had a positive effect on ebit 
sg a spending was lower as a result of our continued focus on cost management and lower employee related costs 
r d expenses also declined  reflecting savings from the restructuring of our early genomics programs

agricultural productivity financial performance for fiscal year net sales for the agricultural productivity segment increased percent  or million  to billion in fiscal year from billion in the comparable prior year period 
the percent  or million  increase in roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides net sales was slightly offset by a percent  or million  decrease in all other agricultural productivity products net sales 
roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides net sales increased in all world areas outside of the united states 
weather conditions in fiscal year were ideal in almost every world area 
in fiscal  the supply of generic glyphosate from china continued to grow somewhat  but was constrained because of major energy and raw material shortages and accompanying price increases 
the tight supply and higher chinese prices provided greater pricing flexibility outside of the united states to everyone in the industry 
fiscal year gross profit for this segment decreased percent  or million  from the comparable period a year ago 
as a percent of sales  gross profit declined percentage points for this segment primarily because of the mix shift to lower priced glyphosate products and a market share decline of several share points in the united states 
the mix shift in the united states was more than offset by improved market conditions in other world areas  particularly brazil 
higher year over year restructuring charges of million were recorded in all other agricultural productivity products cost of goods sold  which also contributed to the gross profit decline 

table of contents monsanto company form k brazil was the most significant contributor to the sales improvement  with a sales volume increase of approximately percent from the comparable period a year ago 
sales volumes in brazil increased because of an increase in non branded contracts entered into in fiscal and strong overall market growth 
brazil s fiscal year net sales also benefited from improved pricing conditions  a mix shift to higher priced branded products  our operational changes that took place in the prior month period  and the favorable effect of the brazilian real exchange rate 
to a lesser extent  sales increased in asia and argentina 
fiscal year net sales of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides in asia increased because of stronger market demand  which resulted from generic glyphosate pricing as previously mentioned and a return to normal weather from drought conditions in the prior year  and favorable exchange rates 
roundup pricing in argentina improved in fiscal year over the comparable prior year period 
also  as of aug 
  there were lower inventory levels of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides in the distribution channel in argentina because of our strategic decisions compared with aug 
 argentine sales in the first three months of the month period ended aug 
  included the effect of actions taken in conjunction with our customers during a time of economic and market turmoil 
a one time exception to our policy regarding crop protection product returns reduced sales for the month period in by approximately million 
excluding the prior year actions and despite the increase in roundup pricing  argentine net sales decreased in fiscal year because of the continued reduction in distribution channel inventory  competitive conditions and dry weather 
fiscal sales of roundup in the united states decreased approximately percent compared with the prior year comparable period and were somewhat offset by an increase in non branded sales 
during fiscal year  we continued to experience competitive pressures and a shift of sales volume to our lower priced branded products  particularly roundup original max  and non branded products 
on the other hand  our us sales volume of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides rose percent year over year 
market share of roundup herbicides in the united states declined several share percentage points in fiscal we believe we will lose several additional market share points between fiscal and fiscal the expectation for market share to continue to decline is consistent with the amount of product purchased by distributors in august as of aug 
  roundup inventories in the us distribution channel were down compared with those as of aug 
  and they included a higher percentage of our mid tier glyphosate products compared to high tier glyphosate products as of aug 
 the net sales decrease for all other agricultural productivity products was primarily because of reduced sales in the animal agriculture business and exiting the triallate herbicide business 
these factors were nearly offset by net sales increases in our lawn and garden herbicide and the environmental technologies businesses 
sales of animal agriculture products decreased because of the posilac product allocation resulting from corrections and improvements being made by sandoz gmbh at its manufacturing facility in austria 
sandoz manufactures the finished dose formulation of posilac and is our sole supplier of the finished dose formulation until we receive us food and drug administration fda approval at our augusta  georgia facility 
these changes are being made in response to issues raised by the fda during and following a november inspection of sandoz s facility and further identified in a march fda warning letter to sandoz 
in second quarter fiscal year  we notified our customers that supplies of posilac would be temporarily limited while sandoz completes the corrections and improvements at its facility in response to issues identified by the fda 
this limitation has temporarily reduced volumes of posilac available for sale and required us to allocate available supplies 
we expect the supply of posilac to be limited well into with incremental increases in supply occurring over time 
this allocation is expected to have a material adverse effect on posilac revenues as long as it continues 
year over year sales also decreased because of triallate herbicide sales as we gradually exited the business in fiscal year we signed a definitive agreement to sell certain triallate intellectual property assets in the third quarter of lawn and garden herbicide net sales increased because of strong market performance in the united states and favorable exchange rates in europe 
us sales benefited from the introduction of a private label product at a large national retailer in fiscal and from a favorable product mix 
we are party to an agency and marketing agreement with scotts with respect to our lawn and garden herbicide business 
for additional details  see our agreement with scotts  at the end of this section 
the environmental technologies business net sales increased in fiscal year because of several major projects that were in progress in the united states and china  there were no major projects in the comparable prior year period 
ebit for the agricultural productivity segment increased substantially to million in fiscal year  up from zero in the prior year month period 
the period included a million charge related to the settlement of solutia s pcb litigation 
despite this segment s sales improvement  gross profit declined million  which negatively impacted ebit in the agricultural productivity segment had higher restructuring charges and net other expense in fiscal year 
table of contents monsanto company form k compared with the same period in the prior year 
total restructuring charges  net of reversals  recorded in fiscal year were million compared with million in the prior year period 
in  net other expense increased primarily because of the advancement of funds to pay for solutia s assumed liabilities in light of solutia s refusal to pay for those liabilities and for legal and other expenses related to the solutia bankruptcy of million 
on the other hand  agricultural productivity sg a expenses slightly declined in from the comparable period a year ago  while total company sg a expenses increased percent 
please refer to the fiscal year discussion in the seeds and genomics segment section of md a for further explanation of the change in allocation of sg a expenses between segments 
agricultural productivity financial performance for the transition period ebit for the agricultural productivity segment declined to a loss of million  from positive ebit of million for the similar eight month period of the largest driver of this segment s ebit decline was the million solutia pcb settlement 
improved operations in latin america and lower costs more than offset reduced us sales 
agricultural productivity net sales in the transition period declined percent from the comparable period in lower us sales of roundup were partially offset by sales gains for roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides elsewhere 
as expected  in the postpatent us market  we continued to experience competitive pressures and a shift of sales volumes to our lower priced branded and non branded glyphosate products 
as a result  the average net selling price of roundup branded products in the united states during the transition period was about percent lower than it was during the comparable period in the previous year 
in addition  volumes sold to distributors during the transition period were less than end user usage  which also reduced our net sales 
volumes of branded roundup declined percent in the transition period 
in the comparable period in  adverse weather conditions reduced the amount of glyphosate used in the us over the top market 
improved performance of glyphosate based herbicides outside the united states partially offset the us net sales decline 
worldwide  volumes of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides grew 
roundup sales in latin america improved from sales in the comparable period in  when the economic crisis in argentina and the operational changes we made in the region caused sales to be lower for that period 
we also benefited from increased demand from supply customers other herbicide producers to whom we sell glyphosate  capitalizing on our manufacturing economies of scale 
the asia pacific region also experienced higher sales volumes during the transition period  led by increased demand from supply customers and by more favorable weather conditions in australia 
however  these gains in asia pacific were partly offset by a net sales decrease in japan  because of our sale of certain herbicide assets to nissan 
net sales of our other agricultural productivity products declined million during the transition period 
selective herbicide sales were down  primarily because of lower sales in the us acetanilide market 
this trend reflects the competitive nature of this market and continued adoption of roundup ready corn traits 
sales in the transition period were also negatively affected by wet weather  which led to some of this season s acetanilide applications being lost 
distributors were conservatively managing their inventories  which also lowered our sales this period 
the animal agriculture business reported moderately lower sales of posilac bovine somatotropin in an extremely weak milk price environment during the transition period 
higher sales of lawn and garden herbicides partially offset these sales declines  as the business benefited from favorable early season weather in the western united states and favorable exchange rates outside the united states 
lawn and garden sales were also higher because of an increase in the number of retail outlets and continued communication of product benefits via national television advertising 
as noted earlier  ebit for the segment was down for the transition period 
significantly lower restructuring costs in the transition period and unusually high bad debt expense in argentina in the comparable period in  as well as improved operations in latin america  partially offset the roundup sales decline and the pcb settlement 
continued cost management also helped lessen the ebit effect of the lower sales of roundup  though sg a expenses were slightly higher overall because of higher employee related costs 
segment results in also included gains from the nissan transaction 
agricultural productivity financial performance for calendar year the decline in agricultural productivity segment net sales was largely attributable to lower sales of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides 
lower sales of these products was driven by a decline in both volumes and average net selling prices  with the largest declines in the united states and argentina 

table of contents monsanto company form k in the united states  net sales of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides were down percent from net sales 
market share loss because of continued competitive pressures in the burndown market  and to a lesser extent the over the top market  contributed to the lower volumes 
in addition  adverse weather conditions in the second and third quarters of reduced the amount of glyphosate used in the over the top  fallow  and postharvest markets 
as a result  the overall growth of the us market was lower than expected  with sales volumes of roundup in the united states declining percent 
in  average net selling prices of branded roundup in the united states declined approximately percent from average net selling prices 
the lower average net selling prices included the effect of continued competitive pressures and a shift in mix to lower priced glyphosate products 
year end distribution channel inventory levels of roundup in the united states were roughly flat compared with year end levels 
in  we launched roundup weathermax  a new high performance formulation of roundup that provides consistent weed control in a variety of less than ideal weather conditions 
poor economic conditions and the operational decisions we made to reduce our risk of doing business in latin america negatively affected sales of roundup in these operational changes included working with our customers in argentina during this difficult time to maintain our long term customer relationships  thereby reducing risks for both parties 
because of the economic conditions in argentina brought on by the economic crisis that began late in and continued into  we allowed some crop protection product returns on a case by case basis 
this one time exception to our policy regarding crop protection product returns reduced sales of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides by approximately million in roundup sales in brazil declined as well  as distribution inventory levels decreased in that country 
in latin america  we intend to keep our distribution inventories at the lower levels achieved in in asia  competitive pricing of generic products decreased sales early in in addition  sales in asia declined for the year as a result of the mid year nissan transaction 
overall sales of our other agricultural productivity businesses declined  though sales in our lawn and garden herbicides and animal agriculture businesses increased 
sales of our us acetanilide products declined because of the adverse weather conditions discussed above and competitive conditions 
sales in our environmental technologies business also declined because of unfavorable industry conditions 
these declines were slightly mitigated by growth in our animal agriculture business  which was led by an percent increase in sales volumes of posilac 
the lawn and garden herbicide business delivered strong sales growth  resulting from growth in the market and from market share gains driven by new product introductions and stronger advertising 
these factors led to an overall decline in ebit for the segment in  with the most notable effects coming from declines in the united states and latin america  driven primarily by the lower sales discussed previously 
lower production volumes of roundup led to unfavorable cost of goods sold manufacturing volume variances  but these effects were offset by cost management efforts and lower prices for raw materials and energy 
segment ebit was negatively affected by the increase in bad debt expense relating to estimated uncollectible accounts receivable in argentina 
our environmental technologies business also experienced an ebit decline 
lower operating expenses slightly mitigated these margin shortfalls 
the sales of certain herbicide assets to nissan and nufarm for use in asia pacific markets reduced sg a expenses and provided other income 
these ebit gains were partially offset by lower herbicide sales in asia 
sg a expenses also declined because of continued cost management and lower employee related expenses 
in addition  our r d spending was lower in  as we continued to focus our spending 
we were able to reduce the cost of goods sold for our posilac business  even while animal agriculture sales increased 
our agreement with scotts in  monsanto entered into an agency and marketing agreement with scotts with respect to our lawn and garden herbicide business 
under the agreement  beginning in the fourth quarter of  scotts was obligated to pay us a million fixed fee each year to defray costs associated with the lawn and garden business 
scotts payment of a portion of this fee owed in each of the first three years of the agreement was deferred  it is required to be paid at later dates  with interest 
monsanto is accruing the deferred portions of the million annual fixed fee owed by scotts ratably over the periods during which it is being earned as a reduction of sg a expenses 
we are also accruing the interest on the amounts owed by scotts and including it in interest income

fiscal year restructuring plan in october  we announced plans to continue to reduce costs primarily associated with our agricultural chemistry business as that segment matures globally 
total restructuring actions approved under the fiscal year restructuring plan were estimated to be million pretax 
these plans included reducing costs associated with our roundup herbicide business  exiting the european breeding and seed business for wheat and barley  and discontinuing the plant made pharmaceuticals program 
these actions were originally expected to require restructuring charges of up to million pretax million aftertax in fiscal year additionally  the approved plan included the million impairment of goodwill in the global wheat business million aftertax  see note goodwill and other intangible assets 
total restructuring charges related to these actions were million pretax million aftertax in charges relating to work force reductions were approximately million lower than originally estimated  primarily because of fewer headcount reductions as resources were reallocated to support the seeds and traits businesses 
charges relating to asset impairments were approximately million lower than previously estimated because of the favorable results from the sale of the european wheat and barley business 
we expect to incur charges of up to million pretax in fiscal year to complete the restructuring actions 
we are following accounting standards sfas no

work force reductions in continuing operations of million were primarily in the areas of downsizing the regional structure in europe  and sales and marketing  manufacturing  r d  and information technology in the united states 
work force reduction charges of million included in discontinued operations were related to employees of the plant made pharmaceuticals program as well as incremental benefit plan costs for employees of the european wheat and barley business 
facility closure charges of million in continuing operations primarily related to the shutdown of production lines and the disposal of discontinued agricultural chemical products in the united states 
facility closure charges of million were also recorded in discontinued operations related to shutdown expenses resulting from the exit of the plant made pharmaceuticals site 
asset impairments in continuing operations of million included million recorded in cost of goods sold and the remainder in restructuring charges net 
property  plant and equipment impairments of million were recorded in the united states  canada and asia for the shutdown of production lines and the disposal of equipment  and in brazil for impairment of computer systems to be consolidated with a global system 
we also recorded inventory impairments of million related to discontinued agricultural chemical products and seed hybrids in argentina  brazil and latin america  discontinued agricultural chemical products in the united states and asia  and disposal of inventory at closed production sites in canada 
asset impairments in restructuring charges net were million  of which million was for the closure of an office building in the united states 
discontinued operations asset impairments of million consisted primarily of property  plant and equipment impairments associated with the plant made pharmaceuticals program 
the actions relating to this restructuring plan resulted in aftertax savings of approximately million in fiscal year  and they are expected to produce aftertax savings of approximately million to million in fiscal year  and approximately million to million in fiscal year  with continuing savings thereafter 
we expect that these actions will lower our costs  primarily sg a  as a percent of sales 
restructuring plan charges recorded in calendar in  monsanto s management approved a restructuring plan 
under this plan  various r d programs and sites were shut down in the united states and europe 
this restructuring plan also involved the closure and downsizing of certain agricultural chemical manufacturing facilities in asia pacific and the united states as a result of more efficient production capacity installed at other monsanto manufacturing sites 
certain seed sites were consolidated  and certain us swine facilities were exited 
finally  the plan included work force reductions in addition to those related to the facility closures 
these additional reductions were primarily marketing and administrative positions in asia pacific  europe africa  and the united states 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded million pretax of net charges in these restructuring costs primarily related to the closure of certain research and manufacturing sites  as well as work force reductions 
work force reductions of million included involuntary employee separation costs for approximately  employees worldwide  including positions in marketing  manufacturing  r d  and administration 
as of aug 
  the planned employee separations were completed 
facility closures and other exit costs totaled million contract terminations 
table of contents monsanto company form k million  equipment dismantling and disposal million  and other shutdown costs million resulting from the exit of certain research and manufacturing sites 
we also wrote off million of property  plant and equipment and million of inventories recorded within cost of goods sold associated with these exit activities 
restructuring reversals of million offset these charges in  as did a million recoverable amount from a third party 
the reversals stemmed primarily from facility closing costs that were lower than originally estimated and higher proceeds from disposed assets than originally estimated 
restructuring reversals were recorded for work force reductions  primarily because severance expenses were lower than originally estimated 
the recoverable amount from a third party represents a portion of work force reduction and exit costs that will be reimbursed to monsanto 
reversals of million were recorded in the transition period because we were able to settle certain liabilities for less than originally estimated 
we recorded million in reversals in fiscal because of lower than anticipated severance expenses 
as of aug 
  the reserve balance was depleted 
we anticipate that the actions related to this plan will yield annual cash savings of more than million 
restructuring plan charges recorded in calendar and in  monsanto s management formulated a plan as part of our overall strategy to focus on certain key crops and to streamline operations 
restructuring and other special items  primarily associated with the implementation of this plan  were recorded in and these charges totaled million pretax  with million recorded in  and million recorded in the net charges were primarily for the streamlining of manufacturing operations  the discontinuation of certain seed hybrids  the elimination of noncore activities  and the exit of certain research programs 
this plan also involved the closure and downsizing of certain agricultural chemical manufacturing facilities to eliminate duplicate manufacturing capacity to formulate and package herbicides 
due to geographical location and cost considerations  improved technologies were installed at other monsanto manufacturing sites 
these sites  by incorporating technological advancements  have been able to increase their production capacity to meet current and expected future demand for roundup herbicide and other herbicides 
the pretax charge of million was partially offset by the reversal of million of restructuring liabilities recorded during and  primarily because severance expenses were lower than originally estimated 
in addition  reversals of million were recorded in primarily because severance expenses relating to the restructuring plan were lower than originally estimated 
the work force reduction charges in million and million included involuntary separation costs for approximately  employees worldwide  including positions in administration  r d  and manufacturing 
facility closures and other exit costs in included contract termination costs million  equipment dismantling and disposal costs million  and other shutdown costs million 
facility closures and other exit costs in included contract termination costs million  property  plant and equipment dismantling and disposal costs million  and other shutdown costs million 
the inventory write offs in related to laureate oil  seed and other inventories 
the inventory write offs in related to discontinued seed hybrids million  unused raw materials at closed agricultural chemical manufacturing facilities million  and other inventories  including certain discontinued agricultural chemical products million 
inventory write offs for both years  as well as million in property  plant and equipment impairments in  were recorded in cost of goods sold 
the remaining million in property  plant and equipment impairments in was recorded in restructuring charges  and was related to the consolidation of agricultural chemical distribution sites and various corporate assets 
the intangible asset impairment in included a million goodwill impairment associated with the decision to terminate certain nutrition programs 
the cost to carry out certain actions related to the restructuring plan was lower than originally anticipated 
accordingly  reserve balances were reduced by reversals of million in fiscal  million in the transition period  and million in each of the month periods ended dec 
 and these actions under the restructuring plan have yielded annual cash savings of more than million 
as of aug 
  there was no outstanding restructuring reserve balance related to this plan 
also included in the plan were special items 
in  a total charge of million was recorded in other expense net to reflect the impairment of equity investments caused by adverse business developments of the investees

 working capital increased because of the following factors our substantial cash position as of aug 
  reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet 
cash and cash equivalents increased million between the respective periods 
this is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in accounts receivable collections year over year 
for further details of trade accounts receivable collections  see the cash flow section 
we increased our position in short term investments by million as of aug 
  to million 
accrued liabilities declined million from year ago levels primarily because of the pcb litigation settlement liability of million that was recorded as of aug

improved collections more than offset higher sales 
net trade receivables as a percent of sales was percent in compared to percent in the comparable month period 
days sales outstanding decreased from in the month period to in fiscal year short term debt increased million due to maturities of long term debt  although total debt outstanding was approximately billion in both periods 
other current assets decreased million between the respective periods 
the largest driver was the net collection of million of the receivable due from commercial insurance related to the pcb settlement in transition period analysis our balance sheet as of aug 
  reflected working capital of billion 
the august working capital grew from working capital levels as of december year end  consistent with the seasonality of our business 
while trade accounts receivable balances are typically higher at this point in the us growing season  certain liabilities are lower 
for example  balances relating to deferred revenue and grower liabilities as of aug 
  were lower than balances as of dec 
 for the august to august comparison  working capital levels grew because of the following factors our cash position reflected the strength of our balance sheet 
as of aug 
  we had more than million of cash on hand 
we also had more than million invested in short term debt securities since december we 
table of contents monsanto company form k used a mix of cash and short term borrowings to fund the solutia pcb litigation settlement payments made in september short term debt levels declined from year ago levels 
our strong cash position allowed us to reduce our reliance on short term financing 
the decline in short term debt also reflected the change in our debt mix to longer term borrowings 
these working capital increases were partially offset by these factors the effect of the solutia pcb settlement decreased our august working capital levels  as increased accrued liabilities were largely offset by a receivable due from commercial insurance and deferred tax assets 
improved operational performance drove accrued liabilities higher because of accruals for customer incentive programs  employee incentives  and income taxes 
our strong working capital management led to lower trade receivables despite higher sales levels and lower inventories  which also decreased net working capital levels 
backlog inventories of finished goods  goods in process  and raw materials and supplies are maintained to meet customer requirements and our scheduled production 
consistent with the nature of the seed industry  we generally produce in one growing season the seed inventories we expect to sell in the following season 
in general  we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of firm orders  production is geared primarily to projections of expected demand 
customer financing program monsanto refers certain of its interested us customers to a third party specialty lender that makes loans directly to monsanto s customers 
this million revolving financing program allows certain us customers to finance their product purchases  royalties and licensing fee obligations  and allows us to reduce our reliance on commercial paper borrowings 
we received million during both fiscal year and the comparable month period from the proceeds of loans made to our customers through this financing program 
monsanto originates these customer loans on behalf of the third party specialty lender  a special purpose entity spe that monsanto consolidates  using monsanto s credit guidelines approved by the lender 
the loans are sold to multiseller commercial paper conduits through a nonconsolidated qualifying special purpose entity qspe 
we have no ownership interest in the lender  the qspe  or the loans 
we service the loans and provide a first loss guarantee of up to million 
as of aug 
  and aug 
  the customer loans held by the qspe and the qspe s liability to the conduits was million and million  respectively 
the lender or the conduits may restrict or discontinue the facility at any time 
if the facility were to terminate  existing loans would be collected by the qspe over their remaining terms generally months or less  and we would revert to our past practice of providing these customers with direct credit purchase terms 
our servicing fee revenues from the program were not significant 
as of aug 
  monsanto s recorded guarantee liability was less than million  based on our historical collection experience with these customers and our current assessment of credit exposure 
adverse changes in the actual loss rate would increase the liability 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  and amended it by issuing fin r in december the spe is included in monsanto s consolidated financial statements 
because qspe s are excluded from the scope of fin r and monsanto does not have the unilateral right to liquidate the qspe  this interpretation does not have an effect on monsanto s accounting for the customer financing program

collections improved in the united states because more customers chose not to take advantage of extended terms in fiscal  and  to a lesser extent  more customers chose to prepay in  both of which were primarily attributable to a stronger agriculture economy 
additionally  a higher amount of us fourth quarter sales were collected in compared with fourth quarter sales that were collected in the same fiscal year as the sale 
year over year collections improved in brazil primarily because of increased liquidity in the market  and to a lesser extent  because of favorable exchange rates 
collections in fiscal were significantly better than historical levels 
we expect fiscal collections to be consistent with or slightly higher than our historical levels 
the net pcb litigation settlement cash payments net of insurance proceeds negatively impacted free cash flow in fiscal year in the month period  we used cash of million to fund the pcb litigation settlement 
additionally  in the month period  a noncash pretax adjustment of million less deferred taxes of million to reconcile cash provided by operations was presented on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in fiscal year  we used cash of million to fund the pcb litigation settlement and received net insurance proceeds of million  which resulted in a net use of cash of million 
the million for the pcb litigation settlement was accrued in august and paid in september we also recorded insurance receivables of million in august of which million net was received in august in  we expect to receive insurance proceeds of approximately million related to the remaining insurance receivables from the pcb litigation settlement 
the deferred income tax line is a noncash adjustment to reconcile net income with those items that provided or required cash 
deferred income taxes were a noncash expense of million in an item that did not require cash and a noncash credit of million in the comparable prior year period an item that did not provide cash 
the tax impact of the pcb litigation settlement of approximately million was recorded in the current deferred tax asset account as of aug 
 in september  after the pcb litigation settlement was funded  this amount was reclassified to current tax liability 
net cash required by investing activities was million for fiscal year compared with million in the comparable prior year period 
the difference between the month periods was primarily because of purchases and maturities of short term investments 
for the months ended aug 
  we invested million in short term securities in december  which matured in april and may of  and in june  we invested million in short term securities 
the net 
table of contents monsanto company form k impact to the month period was a use of cash of million 
in fiscal year  short term investments of million matured in october  and we invested million in short term securities in december the december securities matured in march and april  and we invested million in august the net impact was a use of cash of million 
other investments and property disposal proceeds exceeded the comparable month period by million primarily because of the sale of assets associated with the european wheat and barley business  and the sale of land in cambridge  uk capital expenditures increased percent  or million  to million from the comparable month level 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures to increase from the level and to be in the range of million to million 
the largest drivers of the increase are expected to be projects in r d  manufacturing includes the environmental projects discussed in item business environmental matters  corporate facilities and information technology 
we plan to fund the capital expenditures with net cash provided by operations 
net cash required by financing activities decreased million to million in from million in same period a year ago 
the net change in cash provided from short term financing was million in and the net change in cash required was million in the comparable prior year period 
during  we had strong cash flows  which reduced our need for seasonal borrowings 
in the months ended aug 
  we used our free cash flow to pay down our short term borrowings 
commercial paper outstanding decreased approximately million between aug 
  and aug  no commercial paper was outstanding as of aug 
  and aug 
 stock option exercises totaled million during compared with million in the prior year comparable period 
long term debt proceeds of million in were primarily from our brazil medium term borrowings 
during the prior year period  we issued million of senior notes the notes under our may shelf registration 
there were no debt issuances under the shelf registration in fiscal treasury share purchases totaled million in fiscal year and there were no purchases in the comparable prior year period 
the share purchases are part of our three year million share purchase program  which was authorized by the executive committee of the board of directors on july  as of aug 
  million was available for share purchase under the million authorized amount 
dividend payments increased percent  or million  in fiscal in april  the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from cents per share to cents per share 
in may  the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from cents per share to cents per share 
transition period analysis net cash required by operations decreased million and net cash required by investing activities increased million in the transition period compared with the same eight month period in free cash flow was a negative million for the transition period 
our negative free cash flow for the first eight months of calendar years and was consistent with our historical experience  as we used cash to fund the seasonal fluctuations in our business 
even considering the million cash payment made as partial payment of our share of solutia s pcb litigation and an increase of million of voluntary pension contributions in the transition period  our operations required slightly less cash during the transition period than in the comparable prior year period 
we continued to carefully manage our investments in trade receivables and inventories  and we benefited from strong collections 
our improved financial performance also drove accrued liabilities higher at the end of august than at august the million aftertax charge related to our participation in the settlement of solutia s pcb litigation was included in the net income loss component of the cash flow statement 
net cash required by investing activities increased slightly 
proceeds from the sale of herbicide assets to nissan in were offset by lower capital expenditures and investments in short term debt securities in the transition period 
investments of million matured throughout april and may of  and following strong collections in the second calendar quarter  we invested million in short term debt securities 
in april our board of directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend 
calendar year analysis net cash provided by operations increased million and net cash required by investing activities increased million in compared to free cash flow totaled million in this was a more than threefold increase from free cash flow of million 
though net income was lower in than in  our operations generated almost twice as much cash in this improvement was primarily a result of careful management of our investments in trade receivables and inventories 
capital expenditures declined percent from to  as we completed a number of significant capital projects during cash required by investing activities increased slightly  to million  reflecting the million investment of excess cash  partially offset by the lower capital expenditures and by 
table of contents monsanto company form k proceeds from asset sales 
in  we received million of proceeds from the disposal of property and investments 
this amount included the sale of herbicide assets to nissan 
we also received approximately million from the long term supply agreement with nissan  which was included in cash flow from operations 
capital resources and liquidity as of aug 
 as of dec 
 short term debt long term debt debt to capital ratio a major source of our liquidity is operating cash flows  which are derived from net income 
this cash generating capability provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating  investing and financing needs 
to the extent that cash provided by operations was not sufficient to fund our cash needs  generally during the first half of the calendar year  short term commercial paper borrowings were used to finance these requirements 
our august debt to capital ratio was slightly lower than the august ratio  primarily because of higher shareowners equity as of aug 
 shareowners equity increased because of fiscal net income of million and million in shares issued under employee stock plans 
offsetting these increases to shareowners equity were treasury share purchases of million and cash dividends of million 
total debt outstanding was approximately billion as of both aug 
  and aug 
 because of the seasonality of our business  our august debt to capital ratio was higher than it was in december  but declined from august levels 
our total debt outstanding as of aug 
  declined from aug 
  reflecting the strength of our balance sheet 
growth in the seeds and genomics segment will lessen the effect on liquidity caused by declining prices of roundup 
however  even in the postpatent environment  roundup continues to be a strong cash contributor 
in may  monsanto issued million of senior notes under a billion shelf registration filed in may as of aug 
  we had million available for future debt issuances under this shelf registration 
we also have in place a committed external borrowing facility amounting to billion that was unused as of aug 
 this credit facility gives us the financial flexibility to satisfy short and medium term funding requirements 
in june  we finalized a new five year  billion revolving credit facility that expires in june this facility replaced two million facilities that were available  but unused as of aug 
 covenants under the billion revolving credit facility are consistent with the two million facilities it replaced 
we are continuing to make voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan 
in addition to contributing amounts if required by pension plan regulations  we may also make discretionary contributions if they are merited 
although contributions were not required  monsanto contributed million and million to the us qualified plan during fiscal year and the transition period  respectively 
we also anticipate using a portion of our cash flow in fiscal year to continue to voluntarily contribute to the pension plan in order to maintain future contribution flexibility allowed by regulations 
in september  we voluntarily contributed million to the us qualified plan 
additional contributions outside of the million september contribution are not planned 
while the level of future contributions that would be required is unpredictable and depends heavily on plan asset experience and interest rates  we expect to continue to contribute to the plan on a regular basis in the near term 
in july  the executive committee of the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our common stock over a three year period 
the plan expires on july  in  we purchased million of our common stock under the million authorization 
contractual obligations we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
current estimates of our future payments under these obligations are shown in the following table

contingent liabilities relating to solutia inc off balance sheet arrangement under the separation agreement  we were required to indemnify pharmacia for solutia s assumed liabilities  to the extent that solutia fails to pay  perform or discharge those liabilities 
those liabilities remain the present responsibility of pharmacia 
solutia s assumed liabilities may include  among others  litigation  environmental remediation  and certain retiree liabilities relating to individuals who were employed by pharmacia prior to the solutia spinoff 
solutia and of its us subsidiaries have filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
in the chapter proceeding  solutia is seeking relief from paying certain liabilities  including solutia s assumed liabilities 
solutia has notified pharmacia and monsanto that it was disclaiming its obligations to defend pending or future litigation relating to solutia s assumed liabilities 
solutia has also taken the position that the bankruptcy proceeding prevents it from continuing to perform its environmental obligations except within the boundaries of its current operations 
if solutia is discharged from all or a portion of solutia s assumed liabilities  monsanto may be required to indemnify pharmacia for all or a portion of them 
under the rules of the sec  these contingent liabilities are considered to be an off balance sheet arrangement

seasonality our change in fiscal year end from december to august synchronized our quarterly and annual results with the natural flow of the agricultural cycle in our major markets 
as a result  investors will gain a more complete picture of the north american and latin american growing seasons in the same fiscal year 
sales by our seeds and genomics segment  and to a lesser extent  by our agricultural productivity segment  are seasonal 
in fiscal year  approximately percent of our seeds and genomics segment sales occurred in the second and third quarters 
this segment s seasonality is primarily a function of the purchasing and growing patterns in north america 
agricultural productivity segment sales were more evenly spread across our fiscal year quarters in  with approximately percent of these sales occurring in the second half of net income in was highest in second and third quarters  which correlated with the sales of the seeds and genomics segment and its gross profit contribution 
sales and income may shift somewhat between quarters depending on planting and growing conditions 
our inventory is at its lowest level at the end of our fiscal year  which is consistent with the agricultural cycles in our major markets 
additionally  our trade accounts receivable are at the lowest levels in november primarily because of prepayments received on behalf of both segments in the united states  and the seasonality of our sales as discussed above 
as is the practice in our industry  we regularly extend credit to enable our customers to acquire crop protection products and seeds at the beginning of the growing season 
because of the seasonality of our business and the need to extend credit to customers  we use short term borrowings to finance working capital requirements 
our need for such financing will generally be the highest in the second half of the fiscal year and lowest in the first half of the fiscal year 
however  in we had less reliance on commercial paper borrowings than we had in the past  which reduced our peak in working capital investment 
we expect to continue to have less reliance on commercial paper borrowings in fiscal  similar to fiscal levels  to support operations 
our customer financing program is also expected to continue to reduce our reliance on commercial paper borrowings 

table of contents monsanto company form k outlook focused strategy monsanto has established leadership in agricultural markets by applying advanced technology to develop high value products ahead of its competitors  and by reinforcing strong brands and customer relationships 
we continually improve our products to maintain market leadership and to support near term performance 
our capabilities in biotechnology research are generating a rich product pipeline that is expected to drive long term growth 
we believe that our focused approach to our business and the value we bring to our customers will allow us to maintain an industry leadership position in a highly competitive environment 
our strategic actions will allow us to focus on continued growth in our seeds and traits businesses  with the goal of ensuring that roundup and our other herbicides continue to make strong contributions to cash flow and income 
monsanto is continuing to evolve into a company led by its strengths in seeds and biotechnology traits as a means of delivering solutions to our customers 
as we concentrate our resources on this growth sector of the agricultural industry  we are taking steps to reduce sg a costs particularly those associated with our agricultural chemistry business as that sector matures globally 
monsanto remains the leading manufacturer of the best selling herbicide  roundup  and maintains a very strong manufacturing cost position 
as part of this seed and technology based strategic initiative  we are focusing on projects that we believe have the best commercial potential 
our research and marketing focuses on three crops grown on significant acreage corn  soybeans and cotton 
following our announced exit from our european breeding and seed business for wheat and barley  we finalized the sale of assets associated with that business in in fiscal year  we made the decision to realign our research and development investments to accelerate the development of new and improved traits in corn  cotton and oilseeds  which includes soybeans and canola 
as part of this realignment  we are deferring all further efforts to introduce roundup ready wheat  until such time that other wheat biotechnology traits are introduced 
this decision was reached after a comprehensive review of our research investment portfolio and extensive consultation with customers in the wheat industry 
we will also focus geographically on our top agricultural markets  where we can bring together a broad complement of our products and technologies  while pursuing ways to best participate in other markets 
we have accordingly adopted different business models for different markets 
these actions allow us to diversify our exposure to risk from changes in the marketplace 
our financial strategy will continue to emphasize both earnings and cash flow  and we believe that monsanto is positioned to sustain earnings growth and strong cash flow 
we remain committed to returning cash to shareowners 
our board of directors increased our dividend rate in april  and again in may we began our share repurchase program in fiscal year we expect to continue the share repurchase program until the earlier of july or such time as we have reached the million amount authorized by the board of directors 
we applied our strong cash position to participate in a settlement of solutia s pcb litigation and continue to make voluntary contributions to our pension plan 
we will continue to evaluate using our cash position for acquisition opportunities that meet the strategic needs of our core businesses or for technology arrangements that have the potential to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our research and development efforts 
we have taken decisive steps to address key risks in our business position 
these include the measures noted above  reducing costs in our agricultural chemistry business and pursuing the evolution of our business to an emphasis on seeds and traits 
we have also taken steps to reduce risk and stabilize our business position in latin america 
we remain focused on cost and cash management both to support the progress we have made in managing our investment in working capital in particular  receivables and inventories and to realize the full earnings potential of our businesses 
we will continue to seek additional external financing opportunities for our customers 
we implemented changes in how we approach our argentine business that negatively impacted our sales and earnings in fiscal year and the comparable month period  but are intended to stabilize our business position in this important agricultural market 
the actions we have taken with our customers were designed to reduce risk and to balance earnings and cash during a difficult economic period 
we continue to follow through on business decisions made in recent years aimed at maintaining market leadership and restoring profitability in argentina 
although economic and market 
table of contents monsanto company form k uncertainties remain  we believe we are making progress 
in addition  we continue to focus on reducing our working capital investment in argentina 
seeds and genomics monsanto has built a leading global position in seeds  and the successful integration of seed businesses acquired in the s has allowed us to improve our seed portfolio 
we continue to make improvements in our base seed business  as advanced breeding techniques combined with production practices and plant capital investments have significantly improved germplasm quality  yields and cost 
the performance of monsanto germplasm is reflected in market share gains for both our branded and licensed seed businesses 
we also use our genetic material to develop new varieties for other seed companies brands 
outstanding seed quality and leading germplasm provide a vehicle for delivering biotechnology seed traits  such as herbicide tolerance and insect protection 
biotechnology traits offer growers several benefits lower costs  greater convenience and flexibility  higher yields  and the ability to adopt environmentally responsible practices such as conservation tillage and reduced pesticide use 
we invest more than percent of our r d in the areas of seeds  genomics and biotechnology 
these are the fastest growing segments of the agriculture industry 
by shifting our focus to create value for farmers in seeds and traits  we have set monsanto on a path of sustainable growth  as we expect increasing gross profit from seeds and traits to more than offset a declining contribution from agricultural chemicals 
at the same time  we expect to continue to reduce seed production costs through higher yields on seed production acres and careful management of our seed product portfolio 
roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides can be applied over the top of glyphosate tolerant roundup ready crops  controlling weeds without injury to the crop 
this integration of agricultural chemicals and enhanced seeds offers growers a cost effective solution for weed control 
to date  we have introduced roundup ready traits in soybeans  corn  canola and cotton 
in addition  our insect protection seed traits  such as yieldgard for corn and bollgard and bollgard ii for cotton  serve as alternatives to certain chemical pesticides 
key near term growth opportunities in seeds and traits include continued growth in monsanto s branded and licensed seed market shares  through potential acquisitions  successful breeding of high performance germplasm and continuous improvement in the quality of our seeds  continued growth in licensing of seed germplasm and biotechnology traits to other seed companies through our holden s corn states business and cotton states business  expansion of existing traits  especially in corn  and stacking of additional traits in current biotechnology products  ability to have flexibility to price our traits in line with the value growers have experienced and expect to continue to experience from our traits  and the commercialization of second generation traits  such as bollgard ii cotton 
we can achieve continued growth through stacking and increased penetration of traits in approved markets 
trait stacking is a key growth driver in our seeds and traits business because it allows monsanto to earn a greater share of the farmer s expenditures on each acre 
our past successes provide a significant competitive advantage in delivering stacked trait products and improved  second generation traits 
stacked trait cotton overtook single trait cotton products in monsanto s product mix in and we are seeing the same trend in our corn seed business  where higher value  stacked trait products represent a growing share of total seed sales 
we are in the process of completing the regulatory steps to obtain japanese import approval for yieldgard plus with roundup ready corn  monsanto s three way stacked product that includes the yieldgard corn borer  yieldgard rootworm and roundup ready corn biotech traits 
the epa has granted separate registrations for the traits and  once we receive the requisite japanese approvals  we plan on launching this product in the united states in fiscal year monsanto 
table of contents monsanto company form k corn products designed to be tolerant to the active ingredient in roundup agricultural herbicides are currently marketed as roundup ready corn in the united states 
we are working toward developing products to generate long term growth 
we believe our strategic head start in first and second generation input traits will give us a leadership position in developing output traits that provide consumer benefits and create value for the food industry 
we are working to achieve greater acceptance and to secure additional approvals for our existing biotechnology products globally  and toward the development and timely commercialization of additional products in our pipeline 
we are prioritizing our efforts to gain approvals for biotechnology crops  and while we continue to gain new approvals in global markets  we are pursuing strategies that enable growth even with delays in some global regulatory approvals 
the brazilian government passed a measure  which legalized the planting of roundup ready soybeans in brazil for the crop year 
in october  this legislation was extended to the crop year 
monsanto is working with the brazilian grain industry to collect royalties for the use of our technology  as roundup ready grain is sold to grain handlers for export 
we are continuing our efforts to obtain long term approval for the planting of roundup ready soybeans in brazil  and plan to continue to develop a royalty system  which matches the decisions made by the government of brazil 
more than percent of the grain handlers in two southern brazil states have signed contracts to collect this royalty upon the delivery and sale of the grain produced with roundup ready soybean technology 
we have collected cash from grain handlers in these two southern states 
the system had a slightly negative effect on our earnings in fiscal year because of start up expenses and drought weather conditions 
in fiscal year  we expect the system to be a modest contributor to earnings 
a similar grain based system may also be applicable to other parts of latin america 
however  there is no certainty that royalties on roundup ready soybeans will be profitably collected in brazil or other parts of latin america 
crop import restrictions in some key markets  most notably the european union eu  reduce potential expansion of current and future biotechnology crops in the united states and other markets where they are approved 
however  the development of effective systems to enable farmers growing crops in the united states to sell into elevator systems that do not export to the eu is mitigating the effect of these restrictions 
additionally  monsanto is pursuing approvals to enable the importation of corn and processed corn products that contain the roundup ready and yieldgard rootworm traits into the eu  including those traits as a part of various stacked trait combinations  and has recently received approval from the eu for human consumption  and the import  processing and use in animal feed  of roundup ready corn we are committed to addressing the concerns raised by consumers and by public interest groups and the questions from government regulators regarding agricultural and food products developed through biotechnology 
we also continue to address concerns about the adventitious or certain unintended trace presence of biotechnology materials in seed  grain or feed and food products 
we are responding to the issue of adventitious presence in several ways 
these include seeking sound  science based rules and regulations that clarify and allow for trace amounts  and providing industry leadership to establish the highest standards of purity reasonably achievable and to establish global standards for quality 
we are also working with the seed industry to develop strategies on production interventions that may reduce the likelihood of adventitious presence 
agricultural productivity in recent years  we have seen reduced revenues and earnings from roundup herbicides  which reflect both the overall decline in the agricultural chemicals market and the expiration of us patent protection for the active ingredient in roundup in by aligning our infrastructure and costs with our expectations for the glyphosate herbicide market  however  we believe the roundup franchise can continue to be a significant and sustainable source of cash and income generation for monsanto  even in the face of increased competition 
as expected  the market share and net average selling price of roundup herbicides in the united states have declined since the patent expired in although prices may continue to decline in the future  we do not currently expect the decline in the future net average selling price to be as significant as it has been in recent years 
we expect the net average selling price of roundup in the united states in fiscal to be slightly lower than the net average selling price for fiscal further  we expect the us roundup net average selling price in will start to settle in the range of historical pricing seen outside the united states 
we also believe that we will be able to maintain our leadership position and continue to generate cash from this business 
in postpatent markets around the world  roundup has maintained a leading market position and a price premium compared with generics 
we will continue to support the market leadership of roundup with product innovations  superior customer service and logistics  low cost manufacturing  and further expansion of roundup ready crops and the roundup rewards program 

table of contents monsanto company form k we have several patents on our glyphosate formulations and manufacturing processes in the united states and in other countries 
we continue to differentiate roundup with innovations using proprietary technology 
we also provide more concentrated formulations that provide greater convenience for farmers while reducing production and logistics costs 
we offer a variety of products to meet farmers needs 
the us launch of premium roundup weathermax was followed by the successful launch of roundup original max  which offers key brand advantages versus imitator products at a very competitive price 
monsanto will support roundup through expansion of roundup ready crops and the roundup rewards program 
roundup rewards offers added protection and reduced risk program elements for farmers who use certain monsanto technologies and agricultural herbicides 
further penetration of roundup ready crops also enhances the market position of roundup as a brand name product that farmers trust to avoid the risk of crop injury in over the top use on these crops 
monsanto maintains strong distribution relationships and a unique bulk tank system to support retailers 
monsanto remains the primary global producer of glyphosate  the active ingredient in roundup  with agreements to supply glyphosate to many of our competitors 
our high volume combined with patented process technology allows us to maintain low unit costs 
we continue to reduce production costs  and we are also achieving reductions in working capital through careful management of inventories 
several years ago  roundup distribution channel inventories had increased in the united states 
however  us roundup distribution channel inventory levels at the end of the transition period were slightly down from levels at the end of fiscal year  and levels as of aug 
  declined compared with aug 
 like most chemical herbicides  monsanto s selective herbicides face declining markets and increasing competitive pressures  but they continue to complement our ability to offer fully integrated solutions  particularly in roundup ready corn 
while rapid penetration of roundup ready corn in the united states has also had a negative effect on sales of monsanto s selective corn herbicides  increased gross profit from the roundup ready trait and the roundup used on these acres are significantly higher than the gross profit on lost selective herbicide sales 
our lawn and garden herbicide business remains a strong cash generator and supports monsanto s brand equity in the marketplace 
another key product in our agricultural productivity segment is posilac bovine somatotropin  which improves dairy cow productivity 
the active ingredient for posilac is manufactured both at our new plant in augusta  georgia  and by sandoz gmbh in austria 
sandoz also manufactures the finished dose formulation of posilac  and is our sole supplier of the finished dose formulation until we obtain approval from the fda to manufacture the finished dose formulation at augusta 
in second quarter of fiscal year  we notified our customers that supplies of posilac would be temporarily limited while sandoz completes corrections and improvements at its facility in response to issues identified by the fda 
this limitation has temporarily reduced volumes of posilac available for sale and required us to allocate available supplies 
we expect the supply of posilac to be limited well into with incremental increases in supply occurring over time 
the allocation is expected to have a material adverse effect on posilac revenues as long as it continues 
other information as discussed in item note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements  monsanto is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims relating to a variety of issues 
many of these lawsuits relate to intellectual property disputes 
we expect that such disputes will continue to occur as the agricultural biotechnology industry evolves 
as mentioned in the overview executive summary section of md a  we are required to indemnify pharmacia for solutia s assumed liabilities 
our obligation to indemnify pharmacia for solutia s assumed liabilities is discussed in item legal proceedings and note for additional information on the outlook for monsanto  see cautionary statements risk factors regarding forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we must select and apply various accounting policies 
our most significant policies are described in item note significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to apply our accounting policies  we often need to make estimates based on judgments about future events 
in making such 
table of contents monsanto company form k estimates  we rely on historical experience  market and other conditions  and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
however  the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control 
if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate  our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity may be materially affected 
in addition  if our assumptions change  we may need to revise our estimates  or to take other corrective actions  either of which may also have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates  and our disclosure regarding them  with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors  and do so on a regular basis 
we believe that the following estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments 
in addition  had we used estimates different from any of these  our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity for the current period could have been materially different from those presented 
goodwill a majority of our goodwill relates to our seed company acquisitions 
we are required to assess whether any of our goodwill is impaired 
in order to do this  we apply judgment in determining our reporting units  which represent distinct parts of our business 
the definition of our reporting units affects the results of our goodwill impairment analysis 
our annual goodwill impairment assessment involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or any changes in market conditions  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units by applying discounted cash flow methodologies 
in connection with the adoption of sfas in  we recorded a billion pretax transitional impairment charge relating to our corn and wheat reporting units 
this charge reduced the carrying amount of our goodwill  and it resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change  which reduced net income and shareowners equity 
the company s decision in october to exit the european wheat and barley business required a reevaluation for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the company s global wheat business  and resulted in a million pretax impairment charge in fiscal year the million pretax adjustment to goodwill was recorded as an operating expense  which reduced net income and shareowners equity 
future changes in the fair value of our reporting units could affect our goodwill and operating expenses and reduce shareowners equity 
litigation and other contingencies we are involved in various patent  product liability  consumer  commercial  environmental and other litigation  claims and legal proceedings  for example proceedings relating to solutia s assumed liabilities see item note and item legal proceedings  environmental remediation  and government investigations 
we routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to those matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  to the extent losses are reasonably estimable 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the financial impact  should an adverse outcome occur  is reasonably estimable 
disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  past history  scientific and other evidence  and the specifics and status of each matter 
if our assessment of the various factors changes  we may change our estimates 
that may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual 
predicting the outcome of claims and litigation  and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the actuarial valuations of our pension and other postretirement benefit costs  assets and obligations affects our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
these valuations require the use of assumptions and long range estimates 
these assumptions include  among others assumptions regarding interest and discount rates  assumed long term rates of return on pension plan assets  health care cost trends  and projected rates of salary increases 
we regularly evaluate these assumptions and estimates as new information becomes available 
changes in assumptions caused by conditions in the debt and equity markets  changes in asset mix  and plan experience  for example could have a material effect on our pension obligations and expenses  and can affect our net income  intangible assets  liabilities  and shareowners equity 
in addition  changes in assumptions such as rates of return  fixed income rates used to value liabilities or declines in the fair value of plan assets  may result in voluntary decisions or mandatory requirements to make additional contributions to our qualified pension plan 
because of the design of our postretirement health care plans  our liabilities associated with these plans are not highly sensitive to assumptions regarding health care cost trends 

table of contents monsanto company form k because of the decline in the equity markets in recent years  the fair value of assets in the monsanto us qualified pension plan decreased in as a result  along with the effect of declining interest rates  we recorded additional minimum pension liability adjustments totaling million during calendar year although the equity markets improved during the transition period  interest rates continued to decline 
as a result  we recorded a million increase to the additional minimum pension liability in our financial statements for the transition period 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million increase to the additional minimum pension liability in our financial statements 
the increase in the additional minimum pension liability was less than the increases recorded during the transition period and calendar year because of continued improvement of equity markets 
these adjustments were necessary to keep the recorded pension liability at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for the plan 
these noncash adjustments to increase the additional minimum pension liability decreased shareowners equity  but did not affect our results of operations 
fiscal year pension expense  which will be determined using aug 
  assumptions  is expected to be fairly consistent with pension expense recorded in fiscal year the company reduced its discount rate assumption as of aug 
  from percent to percent to reflect current economic conditions  which would be expected to increase pension expense in fiscal however  the expected return on additional cash contributions made in august and september to the plan will offset any increase in expense due to the lower discount rate 
in determining the discount rate  we use yields on high quality fixed income investments including among other things  moody s aa corporate bond yields that match the duration of the pension obligations 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  our pension obligation is decreased or increased accordingly 
holding all other assumptions constant  we estimate that a half percent decrease in the discount rate will decrease our fiscal year pretax income by approximately million 
our salary rate assumption did not change between fiscal year and the transition period 
holding all other assumptions constant  we estimate that a half percent decrease in the salary rate assumption would increase monsanto s fiscal year pretax income million 
expected rate of return on pension assets is also an important element of plan expense 
in the transition period  we reduced the rate of return on pension plan assets to percent 
to determine the rate of return  we consider the historical experience and expected future performance of the plan assets  as well as the current and expected allocation of the plan assets 
the us qualified pension plan s asset allocation as of aug 
  was approximately percent equity investments  percent fixed income investments and percent other investments  in line with policy ranges 
we periodically evaluate the allocation of plan assets among the different investment classes to ensure that they are within policy guidelines and ranges 
while we do not currently expect to further reduce the assumed rate of return in the near term  holding all other assumptions constant  we estimate that a half percent decrease in the expected return on plan assets would lower monsanto s fiscal year pretax income by approximately million 
deferred income tax assets management regularly assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent management believes that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established 
when a valuation allowance is established or increased  an income tax charge is included in the consolidated financial statements and net deferred tax assets are adjusted accordingly 
changes in tax laws  statutory tax rates  and estimates of the company s future taxable income levels could result in actual realization of the deferred tax assets being materially different from the amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
if the actual recovery amount of the deferred tax asset is less than anticipated  we would be required to write off the remaining deferred tax asset and increase the tax provision  resulting in a reduction of net income and shareowners equity 
in fiscal  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets in argentina and brazil following completion of the crop season in these countries and the preparation of updated long range financial projections for these countries 
we concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets of million related to net operating loss carryforwards nols in argentina will not be realizable prior to their expiration from to and established a valuation allowance for the entire amount in fiscal this conclusion was based on the recent history of losses  the continued uncertain economic conditions see outlook in md a and the limited tax carryforward period of five years 
management is taking actions to attempt to realize such deferred tax assets  however  such actions are dependent  in part  on conditions that are not entirely in management s control 
we also concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in argentina that are not related to the nols noted above through future projected taxable income 
as of aug 
  brazil had a valuation allowance of million for deferred tax assets related to nols because management believed it was more likely than not that such deferred tax assets would not be realized 
however  based on 
table of contents monsanto company form k improvements in brazil s operations related to business changes that we had begun implementing two crop seasons previously  and improvements over that period in brazil s overall economy  and in particular the agricultural sector  management now believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  the previously recorded million valuation allowance  related to nols which have an indefinite life  was reversed in fiscal we also concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in brazil that are not related to the nols noted above through future projected taxable income 
allowance for doubtful trade receivables we maintain an allowance for doubtful trade receivables 
this allowance represents our estimate of accounts receivable that  subsequent to the time of sale  we have estimated to be of doubtful collectibility because our customers may not be able to pay 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider historical bad debt experience  customer creditworthiness  market conditions  and economic conditions 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and we increase the allowance as required 
increases in this allowance will reduce the recorded amount of our net trade receivables  net income and shareowners equity  and increase our bad debt expense 
for example  in june we increased our allowance for estimated uncollectible trade receivables in argentina by million 
this increase in the allowance was required because of the economic turmoil and market conditions there 
additionally  in fiscal year  we increased our allowance for estimated uncollectible trade receivables in argentina by approximately million primarily because of changes to the argentine business model and continued economic difficulty 
see the results of operations discussion in md a for a detailed discussion of this increase 
allowances for returns and inventory obsolescence where the right of return exists in our seed business  sales revenues are reduced at the time of sale to reflect expected returns 
in order to estimate the expected returns  management analyzes historical returns  economic trends  market conditions  and changes in customer demand 
in addition  we establish allowances for obsolescence of inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our return allowances and inventory obsolescence reserves 
if economic and market conditions are different from those we anticipated  actual returns and inventory obsolescence could be materially different from the amounts provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
if seed returns are higher than anticipated  our net sales  net trade receivables  net income and shareowners equity for future periods will be reduced 
if inventory obsolescence is higher than expected  our cost of goods sold will be increased  and our inventory valuations  net income and shareowners equity reduced 
higher than anticipated seed returns affected our results of operations and financial condition in calendar years and in  results were affected by higher than anticipated seed returns primarily corn seed in argentina because of the economic crisis that originated at the end of and the flooding in that same year 
in  we experienced higher than anticipated returns of high priced corn seed  primarily in brazil because of an extremely unusual change in market conditions there

 adoption of eitf did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity as of and for the year ended aug 
 in january  the fasb issued fin  and amended it by issuing fin r in december fin r addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition of consolidation ownership of a majority voting interest does not apply 
this interpretation focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
it concludes that  in the absence of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
if an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity  it would be considered the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is required to include the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the variable interest entity in its financial statements 

table of contents monsanto company form k monsanto adopted the provisions of fin r for the quarter ended feb 
  for interests in variable interest entities that are considered to be special purpose entities 
monsanto has an arrangement with a special purpose entity to provide a financing program for selected monsanto customers 
see customer financing program in md a and note to the consolidated financial for a description of this arrangement 
this special purpose entity is consolidated 
as of may   the company adopted the provisions of fin r for all other types of variable interest entities 
the company has evaluated its relationships with two entities and has determined that  although the entities are variable interest entities and monsanto holds variable interests in the entities  these investments are not required to be consolidated in the company s financial statements pursuant to fin r as monsanto is not the primary beneficiary 
one entity is a biotechnology company focused on plant gene research  development and commercialization  in which the company had a percent equity investment as of aug 
 monsanto currently has an agreement in place under which monsanto makes payments for research services and receives rights to intellectual property developed within funded research 
the entity reported total assets of million and total liabilities of million as of aug 
  and revenues of million for the months ended aug 
 the second entity is a joint venture in which the company has a percent equity investment 
this joint venture packages and sells seeds  with a focus in corn and sunflower seeds  and also sells and distributes agricultural chemical products 
the joint venture reported total assets of million and total liabilities of million as of aug 
  and revenues of million for the months ended aug 
 as of aug 
  monsanto s total estimate of maximum exposure to loss as a result of its relationships with these entities was approximately million  which represents monsanto s equity investments in these entities

 the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare  as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare 
as permitted by fsp  we made a one time election to defer accounting for the effect of the act and  as a result  the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements related to our postretirement benefit plans do not reflect the effects of the act

fsp is effective for monsanto s first quarter of fiscal year monsanto has estimated a reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation of approximately million 
the amount of reduction in annual benefit cost is estimated to be approximately million

 cautionary statements risk factors regarding forward looking statements in this report  and from time to time throughout the year  we share our expectations for our company s future performance 
these forward looking statements represent our best estimates and expectations at the time that we make those statements 
however  by their nature  these types of statements are uncertain and are not guarantees of our future performance 
many events beyond our control will determine whether our expectations will be realized 
in the interests of our investors  and in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of the u 
s private securities litigation reform act of  this section of our report explains some of the important reasons that actual results may be materially different from those that we anticipate 
our forward looking statements include statements about our business plans  the potential development  regulatory approval  and public acceptance of our products  our expected financial performance and the anticipated effect of our strategic actions  domestic or international economic  political and market conditions  and other factors that could affect our future operations or financial position 
any statements we make that are not matters of current reportage or historical fact should be considered forward looking 
such statements often include words such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  will  and similar expressions 
our forward looking statements are current only as of the date of this report 
circumstances change constantly  often unpredictably  and investors should not place undue reliance on these statements 
we disclaim any current intention to revise or update any forward looking statements  or the factors that may affect their realization  whether in light of new information  future events or otherwise  and investors should not rely on us to do so 
competition for roundup herbicides we expect to face continued competition for our branded roundup herbicide product line 
the extent to which we can realize cash and gross profit from these products will depend on our ability to control manufacturing and marketing costs without adversely affecting sales  to predict and respond effectively to competitor pricing  to provide marketing programs meeting the needs of our customers and of the farmers who are our end users  to maintain an efficient distribution system  and to develop new formulations with features attractive to our end users 
regulation and public acceptance of agricultural biotechnology regulatory and legislative requirements affect the testing and planting of seeds containing our biotechnology traits  and the import of crops grown from those seeds 
obtaining testing  planting and import approvals can be lengthy and costly  with no guarantee of success 
planting approvals may also include significant regulatory requirements that can limit our sales 
lack of approval to import crops containing biotechnology traits into key markets can affect sales of our traits  even in jurisdictions where planting has been approved 
legislation or regulation may also require the tracking of biotechnology products and the labeling of food or feed products with ingredients grown from seeds containing biotechnology traits 
such traceability and labeling requirements may cause food processors and food companies to avoid biotechnology and select non biotechnology crop sources  which can affect grower seed purchase decisions and the sale of our products 
some opponents of the technology actively agitate public concern with speculation about the potential for adverse effects of our biotechnology traits on other plants and on the environment  and about the potential for adverse effects of crops containing these traits on animals and human health 
such concerns can affect government approvals and may adversely affect sales of our traits  even after approvals are granted 
in addition  opponents of agricultural biotechnology have attacked facilities used by agricultural biotechnology companies  and may launch future attacks against our field testing sites  and research  production  or other facilities 

table of contents monsanto company form k adventitious presence of biotechnology traits the detection of unintended but unavoidable trace amounts sometimes called adventitious presence of commercial biotechnology traits in conventional non biotechnology seed  or in the grain or products produced from conventional or organic crops  may negatively affect our business or results of operations 
the detection of adventitious presence of traits not approved in the country where detected may result in the withdrawal of seed lots from sale  or in compliance actions such as crop destruction or product recalls 
some growers of organic and conventional crops have claimed that the adventitious presence of any biotechnology traits if present in their crops could cause them commercial harm 
the potential for adventitious presence of biotechnology traits is a factor that can affect general public acceptance of these traits 
concern about adventitious presence could lead to increased regulation  which may include requirements for labeling and traceability  liability transfer mechanisms which may include financial protection insurance  and possible restrictions or moratoria on testing  planting or use of biotechnology traits 
regulation and legislation affecting agricultural products in addition to regulation and legislation specifically affecting our seed biotechnology products  agricultural products and their manufacturers are subject to other government regulation  which affects our sales and profitability 
these regulations affect the development  manufacture and distribution of our products  and non compliance can affect our sales and profitability 
legislation encouraging or discouraging the planting of specific crops can affect our sales 
in addition  claims that increased use of glyphosate herbicides increases the potential for the development of glyphosate resistant weeds could result in restrictions on the use of glyphosate and of seeds containing our roundup ready traits and thereby reduce our sales 
intellectual property intellectual property rights are crucial to our business  and we endeavor to obtain and protect these rights in jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which our products are imported 
intellectual property rights are particularly important with respect to our seeds and genomics segment 
however  we may be unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property in key jurisdictions 
even if protection is obtained  competitors  growers  or others in the chain of commerce may illegally infringe on our rights and such infringement may be difficult to prevent or detect 
for example  the practice of saving seeds from non hybrid crops including  for example  soybeans  canola and cotton containing our biotechnology may prevent us from realizing the full value of our intellectual property  particularly outside the united states 
we must also protect our intellectual property against legal challenges by competitors 
efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement and legal challenges can increase our costs and will not always succeed 
in addition  because of the rapid pace of technological change  and the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions  competitors may be issued patents from applications that were unknown to us prior to issuance 
these patents could reduce the value of our commercial or pipeline products 
because of the rapid pace of change and the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved  we could unknowingly rely on key technologies that are or become patent protected by others  which would require that we seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology  no matter how valuable to our business 
research and development the continued development and commercialization of pipeline products is key to our growth 
the ability to develop and bring new products to market  especially agricultural biotechnology products  requires adequately funded  efficient and successful research and development programs 
inadequate availability of funds  failure to focus r d efforts efficiently  or lack of productivity in r d  would hurt our future growth 
competition in plant biotechnology many companies engage in plant biotechnology research 
their success could render our existing products less competitive 
in addition  a company s speed in getting its new product to market can be a significant competitive advantage 
we expect to see more competition in fiscal year and future years  from agricultural biotechnology firms and from major agrichemical  seed and food companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
weather  natural disasters and accidents our sales and profitability are subject to significant risk from weather conditions and natural disasters that affect commodity prices  seed yields and grower decisions about purchases of our products 
weather conditions also affect the quality  cost and volumes of the seed that we are able to produce and sell 
natural disasters or industrial accidents could also affect our own manufacturing facilities  our major suppliers or our major customers 
manufacturing because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our product development programs and chemical manufacturing processes  we are subject to risks of accidental environmental contamination  and therefore to potential personal injury claims and fines 
we are also subject to regulation of air emissions  waste water discharges and solid waste 
compliance may be costly  and failure to comply may result in penalties and remediation obligations 
in addition  lapses in quality or other manufacturing controls could affect our sales and result in claims for defective products 

table of contents monsanto company form k short term financing we regularly extend credit to our customers in certain areas of the world so that they can buy agricultural products at the beginning of their growing seasons 
because of these credit practices and the seasonality of our sales  we may need to issue short term debt at certain times of the year to fund our cash flow requirements 
the amount of short term debt will be greater to the extent that we are unable to collect customer receivables when due  to repatriate funds from ex us operations  and to manage our costs and expenses 
any downgrade in our credit rating  or other limitation on our access to short term financing or refinancing  would increase our interest cost and adversely affect our profitability 
litigation and contingencies we are involved in major lawsuits concerning contracts  intellectual property  biotechnology  antitrust allegations  and other matters 
adverse outcomes could subject us to substantial damages or limit our ability to sell our products 
in addition  pursuant to the separation agreement  we are required to indemnify pharmacia for solutia s assumed liabilities  to the extent that solutia fails to pay  perform or discharge those liabilities 
both prior to and since its chapter bankruptcy filing  solutia has failed to perform obligations relating to some of solutia s assumed liabilities including disclaiming its obligation to defend certain litigation proceedings and refusing to perform certain of its environmental obligations 
in order to protect its and pharmacia s interest  monsanto has advanced  and expects to advance in the future  funds to pay for some of solutia s assumed liabilities  in light of solutia s refusal to pay for those liabilities  and for legal and other expenses related to solutia s bankruptcy 
if solutia is discharged from all or a portion of these liabilities and obligations in its chapter proceeding  monsanto may be required to indemnify pharmacia for all or a portion of them 
it is reasonably possible that such advancement of funds and or obligation to indemnify pharmacia will result in a material adverse effect on monsanto s financial position  profitability and or liquidity 
additional information about our relationship with solutia and risks related to solutia may be found in item note commitments and contingencies and in other sections of this report 
product distribution to market our products successfully  we must estimate growers future needs  and match our production and the level of product at our distributors to those needs 
however  growers decisions are affected by market and economic conditions that are not known in advance 
failure to provide distributors with enough inventory of our products will reduce our current sales 
however  high product inventory levels at our distributors may reduce sales in future periods  as those distributor inventories are worked down 
large distributor inventories also diminish our ability to react to changes in the market  and increase the risk of obsolescence and seed returns 
in addition  inadequate distributor liquidity could affect distributors ability to pay for our products 
commodity prices fluctuations in commodity prices can affect our costs and our sales 
we purchase our seed inventories from production growers at market prices and retain the seed in inventory until it is sold 
we use hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of changes in these prices 
in addition  the prices of our seeds and traits could be affected by commodity prices 
farmers income  and therefore their ability to purchase our herbicides  seeds and traits  is also affected by commodity prices 
accounting policies and estimates changes to our accounting policies could affect future results 
in addition  changes to generally accepted accounting principles could require adjustments to financial statements for prior periods and changes to our policies for future periods 
in addition  if actual experience differs from the estimates  judgments and assumptions that we used in order to prepare our financial statements  adjustments will need to be made in future periods  which may affect revenues and profitability 
finally  changes in our business practices may result in changes to the way we account for transactions  and may affect comparability between periods 
operations outside the united states sales outside the united states represent more than percent of our revenues 
in addition  we engage in manufacturing  seed production  sales  and or research and development in many parts of the world 
although we have operations in virtually every region  our ex us sales are principally to external customers in argentina  brazil  canada  france and mexico 
accordingly  developments in those parts of the world generally have a more significant effect on our operations than developments in other places 
operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and limitations  including fluctuations in currency values and foreign currency exchange rates  exchange control regulations  changes in local political or economic conditions  import and trade restrictions  import or export licensing requirements and trade policy  restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds  and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad 
acts of terror or war may impair our ability to operate in particular countries or regions  and may impede the flow of goods and services between countries 
customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products  or we may be unable to collect receivables  and imported products could become more expensive for customers to purchase in their local currency 
changes in exchange rates may affect our earnings  the book value of our assets outside the united states  and our shareowners equity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in commodity and equity prices 
market risk represents the risk of a change in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or nonderivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and commodity and equity prices 
monsanto handles market risk in accordance with established policies by engaging in various derivative transactions 
such transactions are not entered into for trading purposes 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the accounting and disclosure of our derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the sensitivity analysis discussed below presents the hypothetical change in fair value of those financial instruments held by the company as of aug 
  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and commodity and equity prices 
actual changes may prove to be greater or less than those hypothesized 
changes in interest rates because the company s short and long term debt exceeds cash and investments  monsanto s interest rate risk exposure pertains primarily to the debt portfolio 
to the extent that we have cash available for investment to ensure liquidity  we will invest that cash only in short term instruments 
the majority of our debt as of aug 
  consisted of fixed rate long term obligations 
market risk with respect to interest rates is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from an immediate hypothetical percentage point parallel shift in the yield curve 
the fair values of the company s investments and loans are based on quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows 
we currently hold debt and investments that mature in less than days  and variable rate medium term notes 
as the carrying amounts on short term loans and investments maturing in less than days and the carrying amounts of variable rate medium term notes approximate their respective fair values  a percentage point change in the interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of our debt and investments portfolio 
on aug 
  monsanto issued million of senior notes the notes under our shelf registration 
the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes was later increased to million 
in may  monsanto issued million of the notes  also under this shelf registration 
these notes were subsequently swapped to six month london interbank offered rate libor  plus a spread of basis points 
as of aug 
  the fair value of the notes was million  and the fair value of the notes including the effect of the swap was million 
a percentage point change in the interest rates would change the fair value of the notes by approximately million  and the fair value of the notes by million 
foreign currency fluctuations in managing foreign currency risk  monsanto focuses on reducing the volatility in consolidated cash flow and earnings caused by fluctuations in exchange rates 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to manage the net currency exposure  in accordance with established hedging policies 
monsanto hedges recorded commercial transaction exposures  intercompany loans  net investments in foreign subsidiaries  and forecasted transactions 
the company s significant hedged positions included the brazilian real  the south african rand  the euro  the australian dollar  and the canadian dollar 
unfavorable currency movements of percent would negatively affect the fair market values of the derivatives held to hedge currency exposures by million 
changes in commodity prices monsanto uses futures contracts to protect itself against commodity price increases  mainly in the seeds and genomics segment 
the majority of these contracts hedge the committed or future purchases of  and the carrying value of payables to growers for  soybean and corn inventories 
a percent decrease in the prices would have a negative effect on the fair value of those futures of million for soybeans and million for corn 
we also use natural gas swaps to manage energy input costs 
a percent decrease in price of gas would have a negative effect on the fair value of the swaps of million 
changes in equity prices the company also has investments in equity securities 
all such investments are classified as long term available for sale investments 
the fair market value of these investments is million 
these securities are listed on a stock exchange or quoted in an over the counter market 
if the market price of the traded securities should decrease by percent  the fair value of the equities would decrease by million 
see note investments for further details
