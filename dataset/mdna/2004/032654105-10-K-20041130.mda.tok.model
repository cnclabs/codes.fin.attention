item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts and as noted results of operations overview fiscal year net sales gross margin diluted eps net income net income as a of sales fiscal years and were successful years for analog devices 
during these two fiscal years we experienced a continuation of what we believe is a broad based cyclical improvement in the semiconductor industry that began for us in the second quarter of fiscal we began fiscal year with a plan to increase net sales by approximately and for gross margins to continue to improve during the year 
net sales increased by to  million in fiscal up from the  million recorded in the prior year 
our gross margins improved by basis points to in fiscal  up from recorded in fiscal for fiscal we had anticipated that operating expenses would grow at a rate significantly less than that of our revenue growth rate 
operating expenses for the fiscal year increased year to year  or slightly less than half the growth rate of net sales for the year 
diluted earnings per share improved to per share in fiscal  up from the per share recorded in fiscal net cash provided by operations was million  or of net sales  in fiscal sales net sales recorded in fiscal were  million  an increase of over net sales of  million recorded in fiscal the million increase in net sales in fiscal was a result of what we believe was a broad based increase in demand for our products used in every end market we serve 
increased demand for our products used in industrial products and communications products accounted for approximately of this year to year increase and increased demand for our products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining increase in net sales 
increased demand for our products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our increased sales in the communications end market 
for fiscal  net sales of  million increased by from the  million recorded in fiscal during fiscal  demand was very strong for our products used in consumer products  while demand was relatively flat for our products used in applications that depend on industrial  enterprise or carrier capital spending 
as a result  demand for analog and dsp products used in wireless handsets  desktop and laptop computers  consumer products such as digital cameras and flat panel displays increased in fiscal above the levels experienced in fiscal in fiscal  analog product sales increased from the levels recorded in fiscal in fiscal  analog product sales increased from the levels recorded in fiscal in fiscal  dsp product sales increased by from the levels recorded in fiscal after increasing from the levels recorded in fiscal over the last three fiscal years  net sales from analog products were in the range of to of net sales and sales of dsp products represented the remaining to of net sales 
sales of new products  which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters  were of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the year over year dollar increase in sales of new products was in fiscal and was attributable to increased demand and design wins for some of our products used in communications  industrial  consumer and computer applications 
this increase followed a year to year dollar increase in sales of new products of in fiscal and a year to year 
table of contents decline of sales of new products of in fiscal as we went through a down turn in the semiconductor industry 
the percentage of sales by geographic region  based upon point of sale  for the last three years is as follows fiscal year region north america europe japan china rest of asia the decrease in north american and european sales and the increase in sales in asia and japan as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal and fiscal were attributable to the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to asia and increased demand for our products in japan and in asia  particularly in china 
the increase in sales in dollar terms in japan was and  respectively  for fiscal and fiscal  and was the result of a general recovery in demand for our products in japan and in particular an increase in demand for our products used in the manufacture of automatic test equipment and consumer products 
sales in dollars increased in fiscal and fiscal by and  respectively  in china and by and  respectively  in the rest of asia as a result of increased demand for products used in communications  industrial  consumer  and computer products 
in fiscal  sales in dollar terms increased by in europe and in north america because of the broad based improvement in demand for our products used in industrial  communications  consumer and computer products 
sales in dollars in fiscal increased by as compared to fiscal in europe as a result of the steady improvement in demand for our products during the year 
the slight increase in fiscal north america sales in dollars as compared to fiscal was attributable to increased demand for our products that was largely offset by the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to locations in asia 
gross margin gross margin improved in fiscal to  million  or of net sales  up basis points from the gross margin of  million  or of net sales  recorded in fiscal in fiscal  gross margins were million  or of net sales 
the improvement in gross margins for both fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level and  to a lesser extent  the impact of restructuring actions taken in recent years as well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations 
research and development fiscal year research and development r d expenses r d expenses as a of net sales r d expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from the million recorded in fiscal r d expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from the million recorded in fiscal r d expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal and from in fiscal as a result of the and year to year increase in revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
r d expenses increased by year to year in fiscal primarily as a result of additional salary and benefit costs associated with a increase in engineering headcount during the year 
these expenses also increased as a result of annual salary increases and increased bonus payments and  to a lesser extent  an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the increased r d activity during the year 
for fiscal  the year to year increase in r d expenses was 
table of contents limited to as a result of acquisition related expenses declining year to year by million and the company limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees and curtailing hiring to strategically important new hires and college hires 
the reduction in acquisition related expenses to million in fiscal from million in fiscal arose primarily because fiscal costs included additional expenses related to fixed value contingent compensation and the achievement of final performance based criteria that did not recur in fiscal r d expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts  which we view as critical to our future growth 
at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore  we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future

for fiscal  the increase in smg a expenses over the levels recorded in fiscal was primarily a result of increased salary and employee benefit costs and bonus payments to employees  increased commission payments as a result of the year to year increase in net sales and  to a lesser extent  increased legal costs associated with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense increases associated with selling and marketing activities 
the increase in smg a expenses in fiscal over fiscal was primarily the result of increased commission amounts paid due to the year to year increase in net sales  the decision to add additional field application engineers to assist existing and potential customers to design products that incorporate adi technology to address their specific requirements  as well as initiatives to publicize new products 
these increases were offset by limitations on discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million for fiscal and fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal from the levels recorded in fiscal was the result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective november   which results in goodwill no longer being amortized 
special charges during fiscal  we recorded special charges of million  and during fiscal we recorded special charges totaling million 
special charges recorded in fiscal years and are more fully described under the heading special charges below 
there were no special charges recorded in fiscal operating income our operating income was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales in fiscal over the levels recorded in fiscal was a result of the basis point year to year improvement in gross margin combined with operating expense increases that were limited to  which was less than half 
table of contents the increase in net sales for the year 
operating income was million  or of net sales  in fiscal nonoperating income and expense interest expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal included interest expense for only months and fiscal included interest expense for months as we redeemed our  million convertible subordinated notes  or notes  on october  in addition  an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in january had the effect of swapping the fixed rate of our notes into a libor based floating rate that was as of november  and was at the time we redeemed our notes on october  these two items resulted in the year to year decline in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the year to year decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal due to the note redemption in this was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal to increase our holdings of longer term  high credit quality bonds  which offer higher yields than shorter term investments  and higher interest rates later in fiscal as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board 
the year to year decrease in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interest bearing investments 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal and fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in the effective rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of the discontinuance of non deductible goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of our adoption of fas goodwill was treated as a permanent difference in the fiscal tax provision  which had the effect of increasing our effective income tax rate

the improvement in net income in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of an increase in net sales  the cessation of goodwill amortization and reduced expenses related to special charges 
the impact of inflation on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
related party transactions one of our directors  who has been a director since  became a director of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  in fiscal we purchased approximately million  million and million of products from tsmc in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those that could be 
table of contents obtained from unaffiliated parties 
approximately million and million was payable to tsmc as of october  and november   respectively 
we anticipate that we will make significant purchases from tsmc in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources fiscal year net cash provided by operations net cash provided by operations as a of net sales during fiscal  net cash provided by operations increased by million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to the year to year increase in net income of million 
during fiscal we received million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs 
these cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of approximately million of our common stock  additions to property  plant and equipment of million and our payment of cash dividends of million in fiscal cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million during fiscal to  million at october  during fiscal  net cash from operations increased by million from the amount recorded in fiscal  primarily due to a year to year increase in net income of million 
in fiscal  we received million from our employee stock plans 
cash inflows in fiscal were offset by additions to property  plant and equipment of million and by a net payment of  million related to the redemption of all of our outstanding notes together with the associated redemption premium and the termination of the related interest rate swap and loan agreement 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million during fiscal to  million at november  from  million at november   primarily as a result of these activities 
accounts receivable of million at the end of fiscal increased by million  or  from million at the end of fiscal this increase resulted principally from a million increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal accounts receivable of million at the end of fiscal increased million  or  from million at the end of fiscal this increase resulted principally from a million increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal days sales outstanding increased from days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal to days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal the year to year increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal was due to a higher level of sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal inventories increased by million  or  from the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal days cost of sales in inventory increased by days to days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventory in dollars was the result of an increase in internal production and purchases of fabricated wafers from external foundries in response to the increases in demand for our products  particularly in the first half of fiscal  combined with the impact of a decline in net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the levels recorded in the prior quarter 
net sales in the fourth quarter of declined from the levels recorded in the prior quarter because incoming order rates from our customers slowed as a result of what we believe is an inventory correction at our customers 
inventories declined by million  or  from the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal days cost of sales in inventory declined by days to days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in inventory in dollars was attributable to tight control of inventory levels as well as increasing demand for our products as the fiscal year progressed 
net additions to property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to the prior year was principally the result of additions to manufacturing capacity at our facilities in response to the increased 
table of contents demand levels for our products we experienced in fiscal and fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we redeemed all of our outstanding notes for cash 
the redemption price was of the principal amount of the notes  or  million 
a net pre tax loss of million was recognized in other expense as a result of the redemption  comprised of a million gain on the redemption of the notes that was offset by a write off of million of deferred financing costs 
the gain on the redemption of the notes was due to the carrying value of the notes being greater than the redemption value as a result of the mark to market of the interest rate component of the notes to fair value 
as a result  apart from operating lease obligations  we had no debt outstanding at the end of fiscal year or fiscal year during fiscal  our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling per outstanding share of common stock  which were paid during the fiscal year 
these dividend payments amounted in total to approximately million 
the payment of future dividends  if any  will be based on our quarterly financial performance 
on august   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of million of our common stock 
we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
management will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million of our common stock under this plan 
our previous repurchase program announced on august  was terminated by resolution of our board of directors on august  the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of october  payment due by period less than more than thousands total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases a software licenses b deferred compensation plan c pension funding d total a certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses 
these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 
b software licenses relate to contractual obligations we have to license electronic design automation software from third parties 
c these payments relate to obligations under the analog devices  inc deferred compensation plan  or the deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation and gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before july  the payment obligations reflected in the table include the planned distributions from the deferred compensation plan for participants who have terminated employment prior to october  and elected to have their plan balance distributed in installments 
the amount in the more than years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment or elected to withdraw their balances prior to october  since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment or elected to withdraw their balances  we have included the future obligation to these participants in the more than years column of the table 

table of contents d our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country 
the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance  interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
in addition  our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements 
the expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 
at october   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
outlook during fiscal years and  we experienced the continuation of what we believe is a broad based cyclical improvement in the semiconductor industry that started for us in the second quarter of fiscal however  during the third quarter of fiscal  incoming order rates from our customers slowed and order cancellations increased 
we believe this is the result of an inventory correction at our customers 
the level of incoming order rates remained low through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal declined from the levels recorded in the prior quarter 
net sales declined in all geographic regions but especially in china and japan where the effects of the inventory correction and the economic constraints imposed by the chinese government impacted demand for our products used in wireless handsets  wireless infrastructure  semiconductor capital equipment  in particular automatic test equipment  and to a lesser extent consumer and computer products 
we are entering fiscal with a cautious outlook particularly for the first fiscal quarter of the year 
much of the order rate decline we have experienced appears to be related to inventory adjustments and we believe we have already absorbed significant inventory reductions at our customers 
there continues to be much uncertainty about interest rate levels and higher energy prices and their potential impact on consumer spending and  as a result  our customers continue to be cautious 
accordingly  we are entering fiscal with low levels of backlog  which limits our visibility and makes it very difficult to predict revenue levels for fiscal against this background  we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million to million and we expect gross margins to remain at to and operating expenses to decline sequentially by between and 
based on these assumptions we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to for the first quarter of fiscal while our current lack of visibility causes us to be cautious about fiscal  we are planning for demand for our products to recover in the second quarter of fiscal and throughout the fiscal year and for our financial results to reflect this improvement in line with the expected recovery in demand 
we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal depreciation expense is expected to increase to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal we anticipate that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat year to year at approximately 

table of contents special charges fiscal special charges during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million 
the charge included a million write down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic packages  which had been done internally at our facility in the philippines 
this amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly  net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets 
we also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write down of million of equipment to its fair value 
during the quarter ended august   we determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded 
accordingly  we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by million related to prior restructuring charges as more fully described below 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in belfast  northern ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications 
the charge included million of severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately manufacturing employees and engineering and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the charge also included million related to the write down of property  plant and equipment to its fair value and million related to the write down of various other assets to their fair values 
the closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal fiscal special charges during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges of approximately million 
the second quarter charge was comprised of million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six inch and one eight inch wafer fabrication facilities  and million primarily related to the impairment of an investment  which was partially offset by an adjustment of million related to equipment cancelation fees recorded in fiscal year the investment impairment  which was related to an equity investment in a private company  was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made 
included in the million special charge were severance and fringe benefit costs of million for manufacturing employees in the united states and ireland  million related to the write down of equipment to be abandoned and million of other charges  primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs 
the write down of equipment was principally due to a decision to discontinue various product development strategies 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we reversed million of the accrual primarily due to lower than previously expected severance costs 
the lower severance costs were the result of a reduction in the number of separated employees and  to a lesser extent  the average tenure of separated employees differing from estimates 
the employees projected to be terminated at the time of the original charge was adjusted down to and  as of may   all of the employees had been terminated 
the reduction in the number of employees to be terminated was due to the transfer of employees  which primarily occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  to positions in our six inch wafer fabrication facilities where we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our products 
all the planned closure and consolidation actions related to our four inch wafer fabrication facilities are now complete 
since severance costs are paid as income continuance at some locations  these amounts will be expended over time subsequent to the final termination of employment 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges of approximately million 
the charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of million related to cost reduction actions taken in several product groups and  to a lesser extent  in manufacturing  million related to the impairment of an investment  million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the closing of an austrian design center acquired in fiscal and million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees 
the investment impairment  which was related to an equity investment in a private company  was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made 
the severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately engineering employees in the united states  
table of contents europe and canada  and approximately manufacturing employees in the united states  all of whom had been terminated as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges of approximately million 
the charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of million related to cost reduction actions taken in the sales group  several product groups and our manufacturing test operations for approximately employees in the united states and europe  all of whom had been terminated as of november  the charges also included million related to the impairment of investments  million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change in estimate of million for additional estimated cleanup costs originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal the investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment to less than its cost basis that was determined to be other than temporary  and to an equity investment in a private company 
the private company equity investment was part of a product strategy that we decided to abandon 
fiscal special charges during fiscal  we recorded special charges of approximately million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the economic climate at that time 
the actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and  to a lesser extent  in selling  marketing and administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities 
the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of million for approximately  employees in the united states  europe  asia and the philippines  all of whom had been terminated as of january  the special charges also included million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancelation fees 
based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancelation fees  the amount paid was million less than the amount recorded for such charges and  accordingly  we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation fees by million in the second quarter of fiscal to reflect this change in estimate 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that the severance costs remaining to be paid would be million less than the amount originally recorded for these charges and also determined that million originally reserved for the termination of two leases would not be required 
therefore  we adjusted the provision for these severance and other costs in the third quarter of fiscal to reflect this change in estimate 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  and amended it by issuing fin r in december fin r requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
because we do not have any variable interest entities  the adoption of fin r in the second quarter of fiscal did not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which enhanced the required disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  but did not change the measurement or recognition principles for those plans 
the statement requires additional interim and annual disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the required interim disclosures were effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal year  and the required annual disclosures are included in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of staff 
table of contents accounting bulletins in order to make the interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
we are following the guidance of sab in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
additionally  eitf issue no 
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
 however  the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our fiscal year ended october  we will evaluate the effect  if any  of eitf issue no 
when final guidance is released 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policy for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user  however  the application of these policies does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary 
while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
long lived assets we review property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property  plant  and equipment during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the 
table of contents preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
goodwill in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the new rules of fas for measuring and assessing goodwill for impairment 
as required by fas  all remaining and future acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
because we have one reporting segment under fas  we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists 
these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly 
at october   we had gross deferred tax assets of million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
in addition  we have provided for potential liabilities due in various jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  accounting for contingencies 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with 
table of contents fas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations

forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management s beliefs and assumptions 
in addition  other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf 
words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
we have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading factors that may affect future results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
we do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity  the risk that our backlog could decline significantly  our ability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers  changes in product mix  and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
in addition  the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns 
our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance  depending on the mix of future business  that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
long term contracts are not typical for us and reductions  cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
in certain markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict  some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment  even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all  or even any  of the product 
at any given time  this situation could affect a portion of our backlog 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall off of sales and backlog 
further  those orders may be for products that meet the customer s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would  in addition  result in an inventory of unsaleable products  resulting in potential inventory write offs 
as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties  the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 
reductions  cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets 
our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new 
table of contents products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense 
there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future  that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets  that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets  that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us  or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets 
furthermore  a decline in demand in one or several of our end user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 
also  some of our customers in these markets are less established  which could subject us to increased credit risk 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future 
many other companies offer products that compete with our products 
some have greater financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources than we have 
additionally  some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies 
our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
we rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly test services  and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 
we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard submicron processes 
this reliance involves several risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
additionally  we utilize third party wafer fabricators as sole source suppliers  primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company 
these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications 
we have no written supply agreements with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders 
if these sole source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us  on the time schedule and of the quality that we require  we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers  which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers 
we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products  and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly 
during these periods of rapid increases in demand  our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand 
we  and the semiconductor industry generally  expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand 
these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results 
our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
we  and the semiconductor industry generally  expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase 
should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges 

table of contents we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
we rely primarily upon know how  rather than on patents  to develop and maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests 
other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes  and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products  if such patents are found to be valid 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses  if required  upon commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
moreover  the laws of foreign countries in which we design  manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
we are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 
there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it 
we believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience  innovation and management skill 
there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology  or reverse engineer our products  or that our confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights  including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers 
we have received from time to time  and may receive in the future  claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us 
an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 
if we do not retain our key personnel  our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel  particularly our experienced engineers  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for these employees is intense 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 
we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas  which could affect the availability of supplies and services 
we  and many companies in the semiconductor industry  rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in california as well as wafer fabrication foundries in taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world 
this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry  including temporary loss of capacity  availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport 
in addition  california has 
table of contents experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity 
to date  the impact on us has been negligible 
however  electricity is a critical resource for us  without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions 
any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire  natural disaster  unavailability of electric power or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 
during fiscal year  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets 
although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 
potential interest rate increases  particularly in the united states and china  as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products 
we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines 
in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry  we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general  including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism  and the response to them by the united states and its allies 
these risks include air transportation disruptions  expropriation  currency controls  currency exchange rate movement  and additional costs related to tax  tariff and freight rate increases 
our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives 
a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control 
these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us 
we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors 
our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations 
termination of a significant distributor  whether at our initiative or the distributor s initiative  could disrupt our current business 
if we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted 
we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing  it is possible that some processes could become unstable 
this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our annual interest income would change by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at october  would change by approximately million for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at november  would not be significantly 
table of contents impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short term nature of a major portion of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months 
the short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at october  and november  currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is against the euro  primarily because europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october  and november   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments  primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
