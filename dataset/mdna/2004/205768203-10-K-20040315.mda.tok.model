represents average equivalent price per mcfe less oil and gas operating expenses per mcfe and general and administrative expenses per mcfe 
cash margin per mcfe is presented because management believes it to be useful to investors in analyzing our operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our oil and gas sales increased million or in to million from million in the increase in sales was mostly due to higher natural gas and crude oil prices and increased oil and natural gas production in our average natural gas price increased by and our average oil price increased by 
on an equivalent unit basis  our average price received for our production in was per mcfe  which was higher than our average price in of per mcfe 
the higher prices were accompanied by a increase in our production 
our natural gas production increased by while our oil production increased by 
the production increases are primarily related to new production resulting from wells drilled in our and drilling programs 
our oil and gas operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million to million in from million in oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced increased to in from in the increase in operating expenses is primarily 
table of contents related to the increase in production and higher production and ad valorem taxes resulting from the significantly higher oil and gas prices in in  we had million in exploration expense  which primarily related to the write off of exploratory dry holes  impairment of certain of our exploratory leasehold and the acquisition of seismic data 
exploration expense for was million  which related to the write off of exploratory dry holes 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million to million in from million in the increase is attributable to our higher production in our depreciation  depletion and amortization per equivalent mcf produced also increased to in from in in  we had a million impairment of our oil and gas properties which primarily relates to some minor valued fields where an impairment was indicated based on estimated future cash flows attributable to the fields estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of overhead reimbursements  of million for were higher than general and administrative expenses of million for the increase was due primarily to the opening of an offshore operations office in houston  texas as well as an increase in the number of employees and higher compensation paid to our employees in interest expense decreased million to million for from million in the decrease was due to a reduction in the average borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of million during as compared to an average of million outstanding in the average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility also decreased to in as compared to in our other income in was million as compared to million in included in other income in was million related to refunds of severance taxes paid in prior years 
for  we reported net income of million  after deducting preferred stock dividends of million 
these results compared to net income from continuing operations in of million  after deducting preferred stock dividends of million 
our income from continuing operations per share for was on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of million as compared to net income from continuing operations per share of for on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of million 
net income for included million in income per share related to the cumulative effect of a change in our accounting for future abandonment cost for our oil and gas properties 
in  we sold certain marginal oil and gas properties 
the operating results of these properties in including the loss on disposal of million per share have been reflected as discontinued operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our oil and gas sales decreased million or in to million from million in the decrease in sales is mostly due to the lower natural gas prices in our average natural gas price decreased by and our average oil price decreased by 
on an equivalent unit basis  our average price received for our production in was per mcfe  which was lower than our average price in of per mcfe 
our average natural gas price in was higher as a result of gains from hedging activities 
without the hedging gains  our natural gas price would have averaged in the lower prices were partially offset by an increase in production 
our natural gas production was up while our oil production fell by 
the natural gas production increase is related to our acquisition of devx energy  inc which we completed in december the oil production decrease was due to normal depletion of our oil properties 
our oil and gas operating expenses  which includes production taxes  increased million or  to million in from million in the increase is due to the higher production level in our oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced decreased by to in from 
table of contents for the decrease in per unit lifting costs is primarily related to lower production taxes resulting from the lower oil and natural gas prices in in  we had million in exploration expense  which primarily related to the write off of exploratory dry holes 
exploration expense for was million which related to the write off of dry holes and the expensing of million in advances made by us to our joint venture partner for seismic data acquisition 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million to million in from million in the increase is attributable to our higher production level in our depreciation  depletion and amortization per equivalent mcf produced increased to in from in our general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of overhead reimbursements that we receive  increased  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and higher compensation paid to our employees in our interest expense increased million or to million in from million for the increase is due to the higher debt level we had as a result of the acquisition of devx energy  inc in december in addition  in march we issued an additional million of our senior notes which refinanced amounts that were borrowed under our bank credit facility 
in  we averaged million outstanding under our bank credit facility at a weighted average interest of 
in  our average outstanding balance was million under the bank credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 
our other income in increased to million from  in included in other income in was million related to refunds of severance taxes paid in prior years 
for  we reported net income from continuing operations of million  after deducting preferred stock dividends of million 
these results compared to net income in of million  after deducting preferred stock dividends of million 
our income from continuing operations per share for was on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of million as compared to net income from continuing operations per share of for on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of million 
in  we sold certain marginal oil and gas properties 
the operating results of these properties in including the loss on disposal of million per share have been reflected as discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources funding for our activities has historically been provided by our operating cash flow  debt or equity financings or asset dispositions 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million 
our other primary funding source in was borrowings of million 
our primary needs for capital  in addition to funding our ongoing operations  relate to the acquisition  development and exploration of our oil and gas properties and the repayment of our debt 
in  we incurred capital expenditures of million for development  exploration and acquisition activities 
we also repaid million of our debt 

table of contents our annual capital expenditure activity is summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties acquisitions of unproved oil and gas properties developmental leasehold costs workovers and recompletions offshore production facilities development drilling exploratory drilling other total the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
we spent million  million and million on development and exploration activities in  and  respectively 
we have budgeted approximately million for development and exploration projects in we expect to use internally generated cash flow to fund development and exploration activity 
our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices  especially natural gas prices 
we spent million  million and million on acquisition activities in  and  respectively 
we do not have a specific acquisition budget for since the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable 
we intend to use borrowings under our bank credit facility  or other debt or equity financings to the extent available  to finance significant acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates  oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions 
the following table summarizes our aggregate liabilities and commitments by year of maturity total in thousands bank credit facility senior notes other debt operating leases at december   we had a million revolving credit facility with toronto dominion texas  inc as administrative agent 
the bank credit facility was a three year revolving credit line with a borrowing base of million at december  indebtedness under the bank credit facility was secured by substantially all of our assets 
all of our subsidiaries were guarantors of this indebtedness 
interest charged on the revolving credit line was based on the utilization of the borrowing base  at our option at either i libor plus to or ii the corporate base rate generally the federal funds rate plus plus to 
the credit facility would have matured on january  and contained covenants that  among other things  restricted our ability to pay cash dividends  limited the amount of our consolidated debt and limited our ability to make certain loans and investments 
financial covenants included the maintenance of a current ratio  maintenance of tangible net worth and maintenance of an interest coverage ratio 

table of contents at december   we had million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding which are due in the notes 
these notes are unsecured obligations of comstock and are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
pursuant to a tender offer  we repurchased million in principal amount of the notes for million plus accrued interest on february  we intend to redeem the remaining million in principal amount of the notes on may  when the notes are first callable at a price of of par value 
the total amount required to repurchase the remaining outstanding notes is million 
the early extinguishment of the notes will result in a pretax loss of million in in connection with the repurchase of the notes  we sold million of senior notes in an underwritten public offering 
the new senior notes are due on march  and bear interest at which is payable semiannually on march and september  commencing september  the notes are unsecured obligations of comstock and are currently guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
on february   we also entered into a new million bank credit facility with bank of montreal  as the administrative agent 
the new credit facility is a four year revolving credit commitment that matures on february  borrowings under the new credit facility are limited to a borrowing base that will be set at million upon the retirement of all of the notes 
borrowings under the new credit facility were used to refinance amounts outstanding under our prior bank credit facility and to fund the repurchase of the notes 
indebtedness under the new credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
the new credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability  which will be redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties 
the borrowing base may be affected by the performance of our properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the determination of the borrowing base will be at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest  based on the utilization of the of the borrowing base  at our option at either libor plus to or the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus to 
a commitment fee of is payable on the unused borrowing base 
the new credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the payment of cash dividends  limit the amount of consolidated debt we may incur and limit our ability to make certain loans and investments 
the only financial covenants are the maintenance of a current ratio and maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the new bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and future growth as contemplated under our current business plan 
however  if our plans or assumptions change or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital  or if such capital is available  that we will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
federal taxation at december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we have established a million valuation allowance against part of the net operating loss carryforwards acquired from devx due to a change in control limitation which will prevent us from fully realizing these carryforwards 
the carryforwards expire from through the value of these carryforwards depends on our ability to generate future taxable income in order to utilize these carryforwards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
we are also required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and gas reserves  including 
table of contents certain general and administrative expenses 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any of our general and administrative expenses 
the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based on the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas reserves that are ultimately recovered 
the estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves used in preparation of our financial statements were determined by an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm and were prepared in accordance with the rules promulgated by the sec and the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
the determination of impairment of our oil and gas reserves is based on the oil and gas reserve estimates using projected future oil and natural gas prices that we have determined to be reasonable 
the projected prices that we employ represent our long term oil and natural gas price forecast and may be higher or lower than the december  market prices for crude oil and natural gas 
for the impairment review of our oil and gas properties that we conducted as of december   we used oil and natural gas prices that were based on the current futures market 
we used oil prices of   and per barrel for  and  respectively  and escalated prices by each year thereafter to a maximum price of per barrel 
for natural gas  we used prices of   and per mcf for  and  respectively  and escalated prices by each year thereafter to a maximum price of per mcf 
to the extent we had used lower prices in our impairment review  an impairment could have been indicated on certain of our oil and gas properties 
new accounting standards we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  this statement requires us to record a liability in the period in which an asset retirement obligation aro is incurred  in an amount equal to the discounted estimated fair value of the obligation that is capitalized 
thereafter  each quarter  this liability is accreted up to the final retirement cost 
the adoption of sfas on january  resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to record i a million decrease in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties  ii a million decrease in accumulated depletion  depreciation and amortization  iii a million decrease in reserve for future abandonment  and iv a gain of  net of income taxes  which was reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections sfas 
prior to sfas  gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt were required to be classified in a company s statements of operations as extraordinary gains or losses  net of associated income taxes  after the determination of income or loss from continuing operations 
sfas requires  except in the case of events or transactions of a highly unusual and infrequent nature  that gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt be classified as components of a company s income or loss from continuing operations 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas did not affect our financial position or reported financial results 
under our the provisions of sfas  gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as components of other income or 
table of contents other expense and will be included in the determination of the income loss from continuing operations of those periods 
we also adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  in this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards that are effective for exit or disposal activities beginning after december  which require that a liability be recognized for an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred 
the adoption of sfas had no effect on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are included in the notes to our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
this liability would be recorded at the inception of a guarantee and would be measured at fair value 
certain guarantees are excluded from the measurement and disclosure provisions while certain other guarantees are excluded from the measurement provisions of the interpretation 
the adoption of the statement in had no effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which was modified in december fin requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the entity does not have a majority of voting interests 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity whose equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
we are not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entities  and accordingly  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements when adopted 
we have been made aware of an issue that has arisen in the industry regarding the application of certain provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas exploration and production companies 
the issue is whether the provisions of sfas and sfas require companies to classify costs associated with mineral rights  including both proved and unproved lease acquisition costs  as intangible assets on the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs 
historically  we have included oil and gas lease acquisition costs as a component of oil and gas properties 
also under consideration is whether sfas requires companies to provide additional disclosures prescribed by sfas for intangible assets for costs associated with mineral rights 
in the event it is determined that costs associated with mineral rights are required to be classified as intangible assets  a substantial portion of our capitalized oil and gas property costs would be separately classified on our balance sheet as intangible assets 
the reclassification of these amounts would not affect the method in which such costs are amortized or the manner in which we assess impairment of capitalized costs 
as a result  net income would not be affected by the reclassification if it were to occur 
as of december   we had million in capitalized leasehold costs  net of accumulated depletion 
related party transactions in recent years  we have not entered into any material transactions with our officers or directors apart from the compensation they are provided for their services 
we also have not entered into any business transactions with our significant stockholders or any other related parties 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s oil and natural gas prices our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
factors influencing oil and natural gas prices include the level of global demand for crude oil  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions which determine the demand for natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on our oil and natural gas production in  a change in the price per barrel of oil would have resulted in a change in our cash flow for such period by approximately million and a change in the price per mcf of natural gas would have changed our cash flow by approximately million 
we periodically use derivative transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to mitigate our exposure to price changes 
during  we did not hedge any of our oil and natural gas production 
while the use of these derivative arrangements limits the downside risk of price declines  such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from price increases 
we use swaps  floors and collars to hedge oil and natural gas prices 
swaps are settled monthly based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of futures contracts quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
generally  when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  we receive a settlement from the counterparty based on the difference multiplied by the volume hedge 
similarly  when the applicable settlement price exceeds the price specified in the contract  we pay the counterparty based on the difference 
we generally receive a settlement from the counterparty for floors when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  which is based on the difference multiplied by the volumes hedged 
for collars  we generally receive a settlement from the counterparty when the settlement price is below the floor and pay a settlement to the counterparty when the settlement price exceeds the cap 
no settlement occurs when the settlement price falls between the floor and the cap 
interest rates at december   we had long term debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the fair market value of the fixed rate debt as of december  was million based on the market price of of the face amount 
at december   we had million outstanding under our bank credit facility  which was subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is tied to libor or the corporate base rate  at our option 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
based on borrowings outstanding at december   a basis point change in interest rates would change our interest expense on our variable rate debt by approximately million 
from january  to december   we had an interest rate swap in place which fixed our libor rate on million of our floating rate debt at 
as a result of this interest rate swap  we realized a loss of  in we had no interest rate derivatives outstanding at december
