item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily market and underwrite personal automobile  motorcycle  and umbrella insurance in california 
we also provide personal automobile insurance in four other western states arizona  nevada  oregon and washington and three midwestern states illinois  indiana and ohio 
we began offering personal auto insurance in illinois  indiana and ohio on january  we believe that we have a reputation for high quality customer service and for being among the most efficient and lowest cost providers of personal auto insurance in the markets we serve 
our primary goals include realizing revenue growth and attaining a combined ratio for our personal auto lines 
our net premiums earned grew in excess of  our best growth rate since  and we improved our personal auto lines combined ratio by two points to 
for the year ended december   our net premiums earned increased to  million from million in for the years ended december  and  the combined ratio for the personal auto lines was and  respectively 
net income for was million  compared to net losses in and of million and million  respectively 
results for the year ended december  include a first quarter after tax charge of million to strengthen earthquake reserves and certain nonrecurring  nonoperational items that increased second quarter net income by million after tax 
in  the company s results included third quarter after tax charges for earthquake and software write offs totaling million 
for the year ended december   cash flow from operations was million compared to million for total assets also increased to billion at december  from billion at december  in december  the company completed a million senior debt offering and used million of the proceeds to increase the statutory surplus of its principal insurance subsidiary

our loss and lae reserves  gross and net of reinsurance  are summarized in the following table amounts in thousands december  gross net gross net unpaid losses and lae personal auto lines     homeowner lines     earthquake lines     total     gross unpaid losses and lae increased by million since the prior year primarily due to a reserve increase of million in the personal auto lines as a result of growth in our customer base 
the increase in the personal auto lines was offset by the million net decrease in the homeowner and earthquake lines  which are in runoff 
unearned premiums increased to million at the end of compared to the prior year end  due to higher volume in our personal auto lines 
debt increased million as a result of a private million senior notes offering executed in december see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements offset by principal payments on a capital lease obligation 
the primary purpose of the debt offering was to increase the statutory surplus of st century insurance company  our wholly owned subsidiary 
claims and other outstanding checks payable increased at the end of from a year ago  consistent with our increased business volume 
other liabilities rose million primarily because of increases relating to various accruals for customer advances  taxes  and personnel costs 
stockholders equity and book value per share increased to million and  respectively  at december   compared to million and at december  the increase for the year ended december   was due to net income of million  other increases relating to common stock of million  less a decrease in other comprehensive income of million and dividends to stockholders of million 
effective december   we changed our state of incorporation from california to delaware 
in connection with the change  our common stock was assigned a par value of per share  resulting in a reclassification of million from common stock to additional paid in capital 
delaware is the state of incorporation for of the fortune and of all publicly traded companies  and was selected by our board of directors after a careful study 
there was no change in the location of company operations  location of employees  or in the way we do business 
liquidity and capital resources st century insurance group 
our holding company s main sources of liquidity historically have been dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries and proceeds from issuance of debt or equity securities 
apart from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock grants to employees  the effects of which have not been significant  we have not issued any equity securities since when aig exercised its warrants to purchase common stock for cash of million 
our insurance subsidiaries have not paid any dividends to our holding company since due to the current uncertainty surrounding the taxability of dividends received by holding companies from their insurance subsidiaries see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  we completed a private offering of million principal amount of percent senior notes due in december the effective interest rate on the senior notes when all offering costs are taken into account and amortized over the term of the senior notes is approximately percent per annum 
of the million net proceeds from the offering  million was used to increase the statutory surplus of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary  st century insurance company  and the balance was retained by our holding company 
effective december   the california department of insurance approved an intercompany lease whereby st century insurance company will lease certain computer software from our holding company 
the monthly lease payment  currently million  started in january and is subject to upward adjustment based on the cost incurred by the holding company to complete certain enhancements to the software 
our holding company s significant cash obligations over the next several years consist of interest payments on the senior notes approximately million annually and the estimated cost to complete certain software enhancements approximately million  exclusive of any dividends to stockholders that our directors may declare  and the repayment of the million principal on the senior notes due in we expect to be able to meet those obligations from sources of cash currently available ie  payments received from the intercompany lease and cash and investments currently on hand at the holding company  which totaled million at december  plus additional funds obtained from the capital markets or from dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries 
absent a favorable resolution of the state income tax issue regarding taxability of intercompany dividends received by insurance holding companies  we may have to pay additional state income taxes of up to approximately on the amount of any such dividends received 
our insurance subsidiaries in could pay million as dividends to us without prior written approval from insurance regulatory authorities 
we are unlikely to have our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to our holding company in as long as the uncertainty persists over the taxability by the state of intercompany dividends 
insurance subsidiaries 
we have achieved underwriting profits in our core auto insurance operations for the last eight quarters and have thereby enhanced our liquidity 
in california  where approximately of our policies are written  we implemented a auto premium rate increase effective march  this increase followed a rate increase in may of however  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will grant future rate increases that may be necessary to offset possible future increases in claims cost trends 
also  we remain exposed to possible upward development in previously recorded reserves for claims pursuant to sb as a result of such uncertainties  underwriting losses could occur in the future 
further  we could be required to liquidate investments to pay claims  possibly during unfavorable market conditions  which could lead to the realization of losses on sales of investments 
adverse outcomes to any of the foregoing uncertainties would create some degree of downward pressure on the insurance subsidiaries earnings  which in turn could negatively impact our liquidity 
as of december   our insurance subsidiaries had a combined statutory surplus of million compared to million at december  the change in statutory surplus was primarily due to statutory net income of million  a capital contribution of million and a decrease in nonadmitted assets of million 
our ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus was at december   compared to at december  the cdi is currently examining the statutory financial statements for the three year period ended december  we are not aware of any proposed adjustments to the statutory financial statements 
on october   the cdi finalized its examination report on the statutory financial statements for the company s california domiciled insurance subsidiaries 
the report did not require the insurance subsidiaries to restate those financial statements 
transactions with related parties 
since  we have entered into several transactions with aig subsidiaries  including various reinsurance agreements  which are discussed under item business 
at december   reinsurance recoverables  net of payables  from aig subsidiaries were million  compared to million at december  other transactions with aig subsidiaries  which are immaterial  have resulted from competitive bidding processes for certain corporate insurance coverages and certain software and data processing services 
in october  as a result of a competitive bidding process  we entered into an agreement with an aig subsidiary to provide investment management services to us  the agreement was subject to approval by the california department of insurance  which granted such approval in october apart from the foregoing  we have no material transactions with related parties 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain contractual obligations  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
on december   the company declared a million cash dividend to stockholders of record on december   which was paid january  the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding senior notes 
payments due by period remaining through through years after amounts in millions total senior notes capital lease obligation debt operating leases total the capital lease obligation above resulted from the sale leaseback transaction discussed earlier 
the lease includes a covenant that if aig ceases to have a majority interest in us  or if statutory surplus falls below million  or if the net premiums written to surplus ratio is greater than  or if claims paying ratings fall below bbb as rated by standard poor s  baa as rated by moody s or b as rated by am best we will either deliver a letter of credit to the lessor or pay the lessor the then outstanding balance  including a prepayment penalty of up to 
our largest insurance subsidiary is the obligor on both the capital lease obligation and the operating lease obligations 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
we do not expect to be required to contribute to our qualified defined benefit plan in  and contributions required for  if any  and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plan s assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plan s obligations 
we had estimated liabilities for losses and lae of million at december   the majority of which will be required to be paid in as the related claims are settled 
we expect operating cash flow to be sufficient to meet our obligations to pay claims and we have readily marketable investments available for sale should operating cash flows prove to be inadequate 
we have no material purchase obligations or other on or off balance sheet long term liabilities or obligations at december  see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no letters of credit  have issued no guarantees on behalf of others other than the guarantee by st century insurance group of the capital lease obligation described above  have no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and have no obligations under any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the company has no material retained interests in assets transferred to any unconsolidated entity see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

underwriting results the tables presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize the company s unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the two years in the period ended december   and the results of operations by line of business for each of the three years then ended 
the following discussion of underwriting results by line of business should be read in conjunction with the information presented in those tables and elsewhere herein 
personal auto 
personal automobile insurance is our primary line of business 
vehicles insured outside of california accounted for less than of our direct written premium in  and direct premiums written for the year ended december   increased million to  million in compared to million in and million in of the million increase in  million was due to rate increases  while million was due to a higher number of insured vehicles 
of the million increase in  million was due to rate increases  million was due to the effects of the consolidation of st of arizona  and million resulted from a higher number of insured vehicles 
current growth is being generated through active advertising for new customers and product innovations 
california auto retention was for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in is primarily due to the april rate increase and the substantial increase in new customers  who typically have a lower retention rate than long time customers 
net premiums earned increased million to  million in  compared to million in and million in the increases in  and are greater than the proportional increase in the corresponding direct premiums written because of the decrease in the quota share reinsurance arrangement with aig subsidiaries from in to until september   at which time we entered into an agreement to cancel future cessions under this treaty 
the cancellation resulted in a one time pre tax charge of million 
the combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to and for and  respectively 
our management remains focused on achieving sustainable growth and a combined ratio of 
in  we achieved an underwriting profit in each quarter and achieved growth of  our best growth since net losses and lae incurred increased million to million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the loss and lae ratios were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effects on the loss and lae ratios of changes in estimates relating to insured events of prior years were in  in and in these changes in estimates pertained mainly to development in average paid loss severities beyond amounts previously anticipated 
for additional discussion of the factors that led to these changes in estimates  please see item of this report under the heading loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
in general  changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which new information becomes available indicating that a change is warranted  usually in conjunction with our monthly actuarial review 
the ratios of underwriting expenses to net premiums earned were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to growth in advertising expenditures and costs associated with increasing the number of new sales agents to handle record volume of new business during the latter half of and all of several productivity enhancement initiatives are underway aimed at reducing per unit process costs and lowering fixed costs in corporate support areas 
in the third quarter of the company entered into a catastrophe reinsurance agreement  which reinsures any covered events  defined as auto physical damage  up to million in excess of million 
this agreement expired on december  effective january  we entered into a new  one year catastrophe reinsurance agreement  which provides reinsurance on covered events up to million in excess of million 
the premium for this reinsurance coverage is approximately million per month 
homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff 
the homeowner and earthquake lines  which are in runoff  experienced adverse development on the remaining loss reserves of million  compared to adverse development of million in and million in  of which development related to sb earthquake claims accounted for million  million  and million  respectively 
we have executed various transactions to exit from our homeowner line 
under a january  agreement with balboa insurance company balboa  a subsidiary of countrywide financial corporation countrywide  of homeowner unearned premium reserves and losses on or after that date were ceded to balboa 
under the terms of this agreement  we retain certain loss adjustment expenses 
we began non renewing homeowner policies expiring on february   and thereafter 
substantially all of these customers were offered homeowner coverage through an affiliate of countrywide 
we have completed this process and no longer have any homeowner policies in force 
we caution that the recorded loss and lae estimates for our earthquake lines are subject to a greater than normal degree of uncertainty for a variety of reasons see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
loss and lae incurred the following table summarizes losses and lae incurred  net of reinsurance  for the periods indicated amounts in thousands years ended december  net losses and lae incurred related to insured events of current year personal auto lines    homeowner lines   earthquake lines total current year    prior years personal auto lines    homeowner lines    earthquake lines    total prior years    total    historically  our actuaries have not projected a range around the carried loss reserves 
rather  they have used several methods and different underlying assumptions to produce a number of point estimates for the required reserves 
management reviews the assumptions underlying the loss ratios and selects the carried reserves after carefully reviewing the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions in relation to the outstanding exposures 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the following prior accident year and policy year loss ratios  rate changes in coverage  reinsurance  or mix of business  and changes in external factors impacting results  such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment 
if our carried reserves are supported by actuarial methods and assumptions that are also believed to be reasonable  then the carried reserves would generally be considered reasonable  and no adjustment would be considered 
the ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only the actuarial point estimate  but also a number of other factors 
other internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions  changes in legal  regulatory  and judicial environments underlying policy pricing  terms and conditions  and claims handling 
generally  actual historical loss development factors are the primary assumptions used to project future loss development 
however  there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past 
historically  our carried loss reserves have developed both redundancies and deficiencies 
adverse development for our personal auto lines was less than of carried personal auto lines reserves in and  and approximately of such reserves in if future loss development differed by percent from those assumptions utilized in the year end personal auto lines loss reserve review  there would be approximately a million redundancy or deficiency in the overall personal auto lines reserve position 
while we have settled earthquake claims and are making progress in resolving outstanding litigation  estimates of both the litigation costs and ultimate settlement or judgment amounts related to these claims are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional background on the northridge earthquake and sb  including a discussion of factors that have contributed to the difficulty of obtaining accurate loss and lae estimates in the wake of that legislation 
investment income we utilize a conservative investment philosophy 
no derivatives or nontraditional securities are held in our investment portfolio and less than of the portfolio consists of equity securities 
substantially the entire portfolio is investment grade 
net investment income was million in  compared to million in and million in average invested assets increased in and in from each of the respective prior years 
the average annual pre tax yields on invested assets were in  in and the average annual after tax yields on invested assets were in  in and in net realized gains on the sale of investments and fixed assets were million in gross realized gains were million and gross realized losses were million  compared to million in gross realized gains were million and gross realized losses were million and net realized gains of million in at december   million of our total investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt bonds with the remainder  representing of the portfolio  invested in taxable securities  compared to and  respectively  at december  as of december   we had a pre tax net unrealized gain of million compared to a net unrealized gain on fixed maturity investments of million in and a net unrealized loss of million in we recognized no other than temporary impairments in   or see discussion under critical accounting policies 
other income other income in the year ended december   included million resulting from a nonrecurring  nonoperational item from the settlement of litigation  interest income of million relating to a favorable settlement with the internal revenue service irs  and miscellaneous items of million 
write off of software in the third quarter of  we recorded a one time pre tax charge to write off million of previously capitalized software costs for abandoned portions of an advanced personal lines processing system 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within those statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
some of our accounting policies require significant judgment to estimate values of either assets or liabilities 
in addition  significant judgment may be needed to apply what often are complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have discussed the assumptions most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to estimate the related items involved 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key assumptions could change future valuations and materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates  together with any changes therein  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae include the accumulation of estimates of losses for claims reported prior to the balance sheet dates  estimates based upon actuarial analysis of historical data of losses for claims incurred but not reported  the development of case reserves to ultimate values and estimates of expenses for investigating  adjusting and settling all incurred claims 
amounts reported are estimates of the ultimate costs of settlement  net of estimated salvage and subrogation 
the estimated liabilities are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events  such as changes in medical and repair costs  as well as economic and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
for our current mix of auto exposures  which include both property and liability exposures  an average of approximately of the ultimate losses are settled within twelve months of the date of loss 
given the inherent variability in the estimates  management believes the aggregate reserves are adequate  although we continue to caution that the reserve estimates relating to sb are subject to a greater than normal degree of variability and possible future material adjustment as new facts become known 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting reserves are reviewed and updated monthly and any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operations 
changes in the estimates for these liabilities flow directly to the income statement on a dollar for dollar basis 
for example  an upward revision of million in the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses would decrease underwriting profit  and pre tax income  by the same million amount 
conversely  a downward revision of million would increase pre tax income by the same million amount 
property and equipment 
accounting standards require a write off to be recognized when an asset is abandoned or an asset group s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
accounting standards require asset groups to be tested for possible impairment under certain conditions 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge to write off million of previously capitalized software costs for abandoned portions of an advanced personal lines processing system 
as such  in we assessed the asset group that included the advanced personal lines processing system for impairment 
however  an impairment was not triggered by the abandonment as we determined that the impairment recognition criterion had not been met 
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group exceeded their carrying amount 
there have been no events or circumstances in that would require a reassessment of the asset group for impairment 
income taxes 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance involves judgment 
generally accepted accounting principles require deferred tax assets and liabilities dtas and dtls  respectively to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements 
for example  we have a dta because the tax bases of our loss and lae reserves are smaller than their book bases 
similarly  we have a dtl because the book basis of our capitalized software exceeds its tax basis 
carryforwards include such items as alternative minimum tax credits  which may be carried forward indefinitely  and net operating losses nols  which can be carried forward years for losses incurred before and years thereafter 
a summary of the significant dtas and dtls relating to the company s temporary differences and carryforwards is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   our dtas total million  and our dtls total million 
the net of those amounts  million  represents the net deferred tax asset reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to reduce dtas but not dtls by a valuation allowance to the extent that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than that any dtas will not be realized 
recognition of a valuation allowance would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which any such recognition were to occur 
the determination of whether a valuation allowance is appropriate requires the exercise of management judgment 
in making this judgment  management is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence as to the likelihood that the dtas will be realized 
portions of our nol carryforward are scheduled to expire beginning in  as shown in the table below amounts in millions year of nol excluding srly nol of consolidated expiration st of arizona st of arizona nol totals our core business has generated an underwriting profit for the past two years 
management believes it is reasonable to expect future underwriting profits and to conclude it is at least more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefits of our dtas 
if necessary  we believe we could implement tax planning strategies  such as investing a higher proportion of our investment portfolio in taxable securities  in order to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the nol carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recognized as of december  however  generating future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors  including regulatory and competitive influences that may be beyond our ability to control 
future underwriting losses could possibly jeopardize our ability to utilize our nols 
in the event adverse development or underwriting losses due to either sb matters or other causes were to occur  management might be required to reach a different conclusion about the realization of the dtas and  if so  recognize a valuation allowance at that time 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs dpac include premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the month policy period in which the related premiums are earned 
srly stands for separate return limitation year 
under the federal tax code  only future income generated by st of arizona may be utilized against this portion of our nol 
management assesses the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs on a quarterly basis 
the assessment calculates the relationship of actuarially estimated costs incurred to premiums from contracts issued or renewed for the period 
we do not consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs 
based on current indications  no reduction in dpac is required 
the loss and lae ratio used in the recoverability estimate is based primarily on the assumption that the future loss and lae ratio will approximate that of the recent past 
while management believes that is a reasonable assumption  actual results could differ materially from such estimates 
investments 
impairment losses for declines in value of fixed maturity investments below cost attributable to issuer specific events are based upon all relevant facts and circumstances for each investment and are recognized when appropriate in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  noncurrent marketable equity securities  emerging issues task force eitf no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment of certain investments  eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  and related guidance  which is evolving 
for fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events  where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary 
where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary  a charge is required to be reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and the fair value 
no such charges were recorded in  or the determination of whether a decline in market value is other than temporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment and the guidance is continually evolving 
the timing and amount of realized losses and gains reported in income could vary if conclusions other than those made by management were to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists 
however  there would be no impact on equity because any unrealized losses are already included in accumulated other comprehensive income
