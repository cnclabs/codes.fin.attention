properties sold as a result of sales activities that were initiated prior to january   such as the fordham road property  continue to be accounted for under the applicable prior accounting guidance 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful lives  which range from seven to years 
betterments  significant renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition  improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
as real estate is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of the real property to the extent that management believes such costs are recoverable through the value of the property 
the recognition of depreciation expense requires estimates by management of the useful life of each property and improvement  as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property  including capitalized costs  to its various components 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense could be misstated 
as construction of the lexington avenue development project progresses and as components of the building are placed into service eg  the space delivered to bloomberg lp during  the company will cease capitalizing property operating expenses  including interest expense  and begin to expense these items  as well as depreciation  for those components 
the company s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change  indicating that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the property 
the carrying amount of an asset would be adjusted  if necessary  to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset 
if the company incorrectly estimates undiscounted cash flows  impairment charges may be different 
the impact of such estimates in connection with future impairment analyses could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
deferred charges direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest and debt expense 
direct costs related to leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the lives of the related leases

percentage rents revenue arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of tenants exceeding defined thresholds these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that this contingent revenue is only to be recognized after the contingency has been removed ie  the sales threshold has been achieved 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective properties this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
condominium sales income arising from the sales of condominium units at the lexington avenue property income on deposits received for sales of condominium units has been deferred in accordance with the deposit method of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate

residential owns the assets comprising the residential condominium units at the company s lexington avenue project 
residential paid no income taxes in the years ended december   and stock options the company accounts for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation cost is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted 
compensation cost for stock options  if any  is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
the company s policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to the quoted market price of the company s common stock on the grant date 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the company s stock options 
stock appreciation rights sars are granted at of the market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
sars vest ratably  becoming fully vested months after grant  and generate compensation expense measured by the excess of the stock price over the exercise price at the balance sheet date

dispositions of properties flushing property on may   the company entered into an agreement to sell its subsidiary which owns the building and has the ground lease for its property in flushing  new york for  the company received a non refundable deposit of  from the purchaser 
by notice of default dated august   the landlord of the premises notified the company of certain alleged defaults under the lease including  but not limited to  the fact that the purchaser performed unauthorized construction at the premises 
the company commenced an action against the landlord for injunctive relief and a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under the lease 
the company has obtained an injunction  which temporarily restrains the landlord from terminating the lease 
on september   the scheduled closing date  the company notified the purchaser that it failed to close and is in default of its obligations under the purchase contract 
since the purchaser has not met its obligations under the purchase contract  the company recognized  as income  representing the non refundable deposit of  net of  for costs associated with this transaction

such a loss could be material 
the company s all risk insurance policies in effect before september  did not expressly exclude coverage for hostile acts  except acts of war 
since september   but prior to the enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act of  insurance companies had  for the most part  excluded terrorist acts from coverage in all risk policies 
the company was generally unable to obtain all risk insurance that includes coverage for terrorist acts for policies renewed during that period 
the company s debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties which are generally non recourse to the company  contain customary covenants requiring the company to maintain insurance 
there can be no assurance that the lenders under these instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments  allowing the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt 
in addition  if lenders insist on coverage for these risks  it may adversely affect the company s ability to finance and or refinance its properties and businesses  including the construction of the lexington avenue development property

in addition  on february   the company increased the builders risk insurance coverage for its lexington avenue project  which includes full coverage for certified terrorist acts  per occurrence  and  for non certified acts  per occurrence 
therefore  the company is at risk for financial loss in excess of these limits for terrorist acts  as defined by the policies and the legislation
