general headquartered in tampa  florida  kforce was formed in august as a result of the combination of romac associates  inc and three of its largest franchises 
following an initial public offering in  kforce grew to offices in major markets 
on april   kforce consummated a merger whereby source services corporation source  was merged into kforce 
the acquisition was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting  accordingly  all historical results were restated to reflect the merger 
kforce now operates through locations in markets and serves clients from fortune as well as local and regional small to mid size companies  with our largest ten clients representing approximately of revenue in proposed merger with hall  kinion associates  inc the firm entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement on december  with hall  kinion associates  inc hall kinion 
hall kinion specializes in providing information technology and finance and accounting related talent on a temporary and permanent basis to its customers primarily in the united states 
hall kinion s publicly announced revenues were million in the fourth quarter of  and million for the full year 
kforce has notified hall kinion that it believes certain conditions exist or will exist that have or will have a material adverse effect on hall kinion 
hall kinion has informed kforce that it disagrees with kforce s position  has suspended kforce s access to its personnel and has requested that kforce s board of directors confirm its intention to recommend the proposed transaction to the kforce shareholders 
at a march  special meeting of kforce s board of directors concerning the transaction  the board considered hall kinion s request  but did not reconfirm its intention to recommend the proposed merger to kforce shareholders 
accordingly  kforce believes that there is a great deal of uncertainty relating to the proposed merger and that there can be no assurance that it will be consummated 
if a merger does proceed  the terms may be substantially revised 
the closing of the transaction under the current terms of the merger agreement is also subject to finalizing the necessary regulatory approvals  obtaining approvals from both firms shareholders and compliance with all of the terms in the merger agreement 
if the proposed merger is consummated  it would be accounted for using the purchase method 

table of contents kforce has incurred costs associated with this potential transaction that would be included in the purchase price if a merger were to occur 
capitalized costs amounted to approximately million at december   and together with such costs incurred during the first quarter  may exceed million 
costs that otherwise would have been includable in the purchase price  would be charged to expense in the quarter during which it is determined that a merger is not likely to proceed  if such determination is made 
additionally  as expected  integration planning expenses are being incurred in the first quarter that  together with the potential write offs described above  could result in aggregate merger related charges exceeding million

industry overview the temporary staffing industry has evolved over the past several decades as companies have utilized temporary employees to manage personnel costs  while meeting specialized or fluctuating staffing requirements 
the national association of temporary and staffing services estimated that more than of all us businesses utilize temporary staffing services 
selected industry reports indicate the united states temporary staffing industry contracted from an estimated billion in to billion in and grew to billion in revenues have been significantly impacted by the economic slowdown 
flexible staffing demand in the information technology and finance and accounting sectors  as well as search placements  have been particularly affected 
the health and life sciences sector also experienced slowed growth in many competitors are entering the healthcare  pharmaceutical and scientific staffing sectors 
competition in nursing has become particularly intense and may further impact pricing and the ability to attract candidates 
nursing revenue for the firm continued to erode throughout increasing competition and pricing pressure may result in reduced gross margins and lower profitability 
there can be no assurance that customer demand for kforce s specialty staffing sectors will return to previous levels or that pricing will return to historical levels 
there can be no assurance that the kforce health and life sciences business segment will be able to access a sufficient candidate pool to service client needs 
in addition  a number of national staffing companies are attempting to introduce a lower priced staffing preferred vendor model 
these factors may impact the future growth and profitability of the health and life sciences division 
we believe  however  that demand for specialty staffing is highly correlated to economic conditions and expect demand to increase with an economic recovery 
we also believe that the professional and technical temporary staffing industry offers more opportunity for higher profitability than the clerical and light industrial staffing segments  because of the value added nature of professional and technical personnel 
business strategy kforce is a national provider of professional and technical specialty staffing services 
key elements of our business strategy include the following focus on value added services 
we focus on providing specialty staffing services to our clients  specifically in the areas of information technology  finance and accounting and health and life sciences 
we believe  based upon data published by the us bureau of labor statistics and other sources  that future employment growth may be significant in these sectors 
the placement of highly skilled personnel requires operational and technical knowledge to effectively recruit and screen personnel  match them to client needs  and develop and manage the resulting relationships 
we believe our historical focus in this market  combined with our staff s operating expertise  provides us with a competitive advantage 

table of contents build long term  consultative relationships 
we believe we have developed long term relationships with our clients by providing solutions to their specialty staffing requirements 
we strive to differentiate ourselves by working closely with our clients to maximize their return on human assets 
in addition  kforce s ability to offer flexible staffing services  coupled with its permanent placement capability  offers the client a multi faceted provider of specialty staffing services 
this ability enables kforce to emphasize consultative rather than just transactional client relationships 
achieve extensive client penetration 
our client development process focuses on repeated contacts with client employees responsible for staffing decisions 
contacts are made within numerous functional departments and at many different organizational levels within the client 
our operating employees are trained to develop a thorough understanding of each client s total staffing requirements 
recruit high quality consultants 
we place great emphasis on recruiting qualified consultants 
we believe we have a recruiting advantage over those of our competitors that lack the ability to offer candidates flexible and permanent opportunities 
we frequently place candidates seeking permanent employment in flexible assignments until a permanent position becomes available as well as convert temporary candidates into permanent employees of our client companies 
encourage employee achievement 
we promote a quality focused  results oriented culture 
our placement associates and corporate personnel are given incentives to encourage the achievement of corporate goals 
functional service lines in january  kforce realigned the organizational structure in its financial and accounting and information technology business units by aligning them along major markets and emerging markets 
kforce believes this major emerging market operational alignment will develop a more customer centric organization  leverage our best leaders  leverage client relationships across functional offerings and streamline the organization by placing senior management closer to the customer as well as achieve greater cost efficiency 
the health and life sciences segment is organized and managed by specialty 
the functional areas are defined as information technology 
the bureau of labor statistics lists computer and data processing services among the fastest growing industries over the last decade 
the shortage of technical expertise to operate the advanced systems that businesses have acquired over the last decade is a major catalyst contributing to the growth of this segment 
our information technology services focus primarily on more sophisticated areas of information technologies ie  systems applications programmers  systems analysts  and e business and networking technicians 
the economic slowdown has significantly affected the willingness and ability of companies to commit capital resources to their technology systems infrastructure 
while we believe that the long term business catalysts of technology remain in place  there can be no assurance that spending in the sector will return to the levels seen over the last decade 
finance and accounting 
our finance and accounting personnel provide both temporary staffing and search placement services to our clients in areas such as taxation  budget preparation and analysis  financial reporting  cost analysis  accounts payable  accounts receivable  credit and collections  general accounting  audit services and systems and controls analysis and documentation to support sarbanes oxley section compliance work 
we believe we have built a reputation for providing qualified finance and accounting professionals to businesses 
this business segment typically experiences its strongest demand in the months preceeding and subsequent to the end of the calendar year as the result of increased demand for finance professionals to work on year end closing and tax related assignments 
during the recent economic slowdown  finance and accounting revenues have decreased significantly 
there can be no assurance that revenue in the finance and accounting sector will return to prior levels 
health and life sciences 
this segment consists of skilled professionals and technical services in the pharmaceutical  health care and scientific fields 
examples of positions in these categories are clinical research associates cras for the pharmaceutical industry  and health care information management professionals and nurses for hospitals 
the scientific specialty group supplies laboratory  research and development  quality assurance and quality control 
table of contents professionals to a variety of industries 
this segment  and in particular the pharmaceutical and scientific businesses  exhibits decreases in demand the final two weeks of the year as the result of holiday shut downs at many large clients 
we have continued to divest non core businesses and supplement our key business segments 
in december  kforce sold its training business unit resulting in a loss of million 
also in december  we sold our legal staffing unit as part of the consideration in acquiring scientific staffing  inc the legal unit had revenues of million in in the fourth quarter of  we also exited our human resources business  whose operating results are included in the information technology business segment 
the human resource business had million and million of revenue in and  respectively 
kforce also acquired emergency response staffing inc  a healthcare nurse staffing company with locations in phoenix  arizona and san diego  california  in december in realigning our operations and divesting the legal  education services and human resources units  we believe we have strengthened our focus on our core specialty staffing business 
financial information regarding our functional service lines is included in item of part ii 
staffing services staffing services are provided to our clients based on an analysis of each client s individual functional needs  including a determination of time duration of services required 
the firm offers staffing services in two categories flexible staffing services and search services 
in  flexible staffing and search services accounted for and of revenue  respectively 
flexible staffing the firm offers flexible staffing services  providing personnel in the fields of information technology  finance and accounting  and health and life sciences 
flexible staffing services entail placing skilled workers in the client environment on a contractual basis 
assignments typically run from three months to one year in duration 
we currently offer flexible staffing services in most large metropolitan market areas 
search services the firm provides search services permanent placement for professional and technical personnel in the areas of information technology  finance and accounting  financial services  pharmaceutical research  health care and scientific 
the firm primarily performs contingency searches 
a contingency search results in revenue to the firm only when personnel are actually hired by a client 
our strategy is to perform contingency searches primarily in our core businesses 
fees are typically structured as a percentage of the placed individual s first year annual compensation 
client searches that are outside a core business area are typically restricted to management or executive level positions and require a targeted research and recruiting effort 
the firm typically performs these searches as retained searches where the client pays a part of the search fee in advance and the remainder upon completion of the search 
retained searches represent only a nominal portion of our search services 
an active database of candidates is maintained as the result of our continuous recruiting efforts and reputation in the industry 
in addition  many candidates are located as a result of referrals from the flexible staffing services activities 
the clients targeted for search services are typically the same as those targeted for flexible staffing services 
this common focus is intended to contribute to the firm s objective of providing an integrated solution for our clients personnel needs 
search services have been severely impacted by the economic downturn and continued to deteriorate in there can be no assurance or expectation that search services revenues will return to prior levels 
technology kforce s nationwide computer  telephony and data communications infrastructure was upgraded in to take advantage of faster and lower cost devices and services 
we believe that these projects improved internal communications and should reduce associated costs 
in  we changed our outsourced data center host 
total costs incurred to change vendors were approximately million  including a million cancellation fee 
the change is 
table of contents expected to save million annually for each of the next three years 
the firm also implemented an enterprise wide project management process that we believe has greatly enhanced our ability to plan  implement and align information technology initiatives 
while we believe our technology systems are adequate to meet our current needs  there can be no assurance that they will not be subject to system outages or data loss caused by natural or man made disaster 
in addition  the firm depends on certain third party vendors whose reliability we can not guarantee going forward 
one or more of such events could negatively impact our ability to conduct our normal course of business 
trademarks the kforce trademark  which is registered with the united states patent and trademark office  is important to our business 
competition the specialty staffing services industry is very competitive and fragmented 
there are relatively few barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market 
a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources than those we possess 
we face substantial competition from large national firms and local specialty staffing firms 
the local firms are typically operator owned  and each market generally has one or more significant competitors 
we also face competition from national clerical and light industrial staffing firms and national and regional accounting firms that also offer certain specialty staffing services 
additionally  there are a number of internet job boards that are offering traditional staffing services 
in the united states  approximately national competitors operate  and more than  smaller organizations compete in varying degrees at local levels 
several similar companies global  national  and local compete in foreign markets 
in  kforce s largest competitors were adecco  sa  manpower  inc  mps group  inc  robert half international inc  spherion corporation and cdi corporation 
the firm believes that availability and quality of personnel  level of service  effective monitoring of job performance  scope of geographic service and price of service are the principal elements of competition in our industry 
we believe that availability of quality personnel is especially important 
in order to attract candidates  we place emphasis upon our ability to provide permanent placement opportunities  competitive compensation and benefits  quality and varied assignments and scheduling flexibility 
because personnel pursue other employment opportunities on a regular basis  it is important that we respond to market conditions affecting these individuals 
additionally  in certain markets and in response to economic softening  we have experienced significant pricing pressure from some of our competitors 
although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors  we expect competition and pricing pressure to continue  and there can be no assurance that we will remain competitive 
insurance the firm maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability  automobile liability and employers liability each with excess liability coverage 
we also maintain workers compensation  fidelity  fiduciary  directors and officers  professional liability  and employment practices liability policies 
these policies provide coverage subject to their terms  conditions  limits of liability  and deductibles  for certain liabilities that may arise from the firm s operations 
there can be no assurance that any of the above coverage will be adequate for our needs  or that we will maintain all such policies in the future 
financial information about foreign and domestic operations materially all of the firm s revenues are derived from domestic operations with customers located in the united states  for the years ended december  and in  the firm discontinued operations in its only foreign office  in canada 
canadian operations contributed revenue of  for the year ended and finalized operational expenses in available information we make available  free of charge  through the investor relations page on our website  and by responding to requests addressed to our vice president investor relations  the annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and all amendments to those reports

table of contents operating employees and personnel as of december   kforce employed  operating employees and had approximately  consultants on assignment flexible consultants providing flexible staffing services to our clients 
flexible consultants are primarily individuals who are employed directly by kforce flexible employees  the balance are individuals who are employed by other entities independent contractors 
as the employer  the firm is responsible for the operating employees and flexible employees payrolls and the employer s share of applicable social security taxes fica  federal and state unemployment taxes  workers compensation insurance  and other direct labor costs relating to our employees 
we offer access to various health  life and disability insurance programs and other benefits for operating employees and flexible employees 
we have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our operating employees or flexible employees  have never experienced any material labor disruption  and are unaware of any current efforts or plans to organize any of our employees 
risk factors the recent economic downturn has adversely affected the demand for the firm s services 
historically  the general level of economic activity has significantly affected the demand for employment services 
as economic activity slows  the use of temporary and contract personnel tends to be curtailed before permanent employees are laid off 
the current economic downturn has adversely affected the demand for temporary and contract personnel  which in turn has had an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
additionally  the use of search firms for permanent hires has declined significantly 
we expect that future economic downturns will continue to have similar effects 
the recent economic downturn resulted in lessened demand for our services 
there can be no assurance that demand will remain at current or return to prior levels  and demand may continue to deteriorate 
in and a substantial portion of  we experienced a continuation of the economic slowdown in the it industry that reflected a slowdown in the rate of innovation in this industry and a general reduction in demand for personnel with expertise in leading hardware  software or networking technologies 
this has reduced the demand for our services 
reduction in demand for our services had a material negative impact on our business  operating results and financial condition in and  and limited profitability in the firm s liquidity may be adversely impacted by covenants in our credit facility 
on november   the firm entered into a million amended and restated credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by bank of america the credit facility 
on december   the firm amended certain terms and conditions of the credit facility  and extended its term to november  the credit facility provides for a maximum revolving credit facility of million 
we believe that the new terms provide a substantial improvement in pricing and flexibility 
the terms of the credit facility include certain financial covenants to which the firm is subject  including a requirement to maintain at least million of borrowing availability 
in addition  should the amount available to be borrowed be less than million but greater than million the firm must attain certain ebitda targets 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under this credit facility with an additional million of borrowing available  without triggering the financial covenants and million in total availability 
at no time during the existence of the credit facility have we ever triggered such covenants 
if such financial covenants were triggered in the future and if we do not comply with them  such a breach of the credit facility could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
such lack of compliance could result  among other things  in the acceleration of all amounts borrowed under the credit facility 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the firm may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
the firm depends upon the abilities of its staff to attract and retain personnel  particularly technical and professional personnel  who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our clients 
we must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies 
we expect competition for individuals with proven technical or 
table of contents professional skills for the foreseeable future 
if qualified personnel are not available to us in sufficient numbers and upon economic terms acceptable to us  it could have a material detrimental effect on our business 
the firm s current market share may decrease as  a result of limited barriers to entry for new competitors and discontinuation of clients outsourcing of their staffing needs 
the firm faces significant competition in the markets we serve  and there are limited barriers to entry for new competitors 
the competition among staffing services firms is intense 
the firm competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services  systems integrators  computer systems consultants  temporary personnel agencies  search firms and other providers of staffing services 
a number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we do 
from time to time we experience significant pressure from our clients to reduce price levels 
during these periods  we may face increased competitive pricing pressures and may not be able to recruit the personnel necessary to fill our clients needs 
we also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective clients will decide to provide similar services internally 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully compete 
we do not provide an offshore outsourcing solution 
many staffing customers are now seeking an offshore solution to support their technology and business process function and  as a result  a significant amount of technology and financial staffing may be replaced by offshore resources 
we do not currently provide an offshore program and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against the offshore solution providers or that we will not lose significant market share and revenue 
we rely on short term contracts with most of our clients 
because long term contracts are not a significant part of our business  future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 
decreases in patient occupancy at healthcare clients facilities may adversely affect the profitability of the firm s business 
demand for temporary healthcare staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of patient occupancy at healthcare clients facilities 
when a hospital s occupancy increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as occupancy decreases  clients may reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees 
the firm may also experience more competitive pricing pressure during periods of occupancy downturn 
this reduction in occupancy could adversely affect the demand for services and the firm s profitability 
there has been a significantly lessened demand for our healthcare staffing services in recent years 
there can be no assurance that such demand will remain at current or return to prior levels 
competition for acquisition opportunities may restrict the firm s future growth by limiting our ability to make acquisitions at reasonable valuations 
the firm s business strategy includes increasing market share and presence in the staffing industry through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business 
we have historically faced competition for acquisitions 
in the future  this could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non accretive to us 
in addition  the firm may be limited by its ability to obtain financing to consummate desirable acquisitions 
the firm may face difficulties integrating acquisitions into existing operations and acquisitions may be unsuccessful  involve significant cash expenditures or expose the firm to unforeseen liabilities 
the firm continually evaluates opportunities to acquire staffing companies that complement or enhance our business and frequently have preliminary acquisition discussions with some of these companies 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential loss of key employees or clients of acquired companies  difficulties integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into a single business  diversion of management attention from existing operations  and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies 

table of contents these acquisitions may also involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence  integration expenses and exposure to unforeseen liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business and financial condition 
the firm depends on the proper functioning of our information systems 
the firm is dependent on the proper functioning of information systems in operating its business 
critical information systems are used in every aspect of the firm s daily operations  most significantly  in the identification and matching of staffing resources to client assignments and in the customer billing and consultant payment functions 
the firm s information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards including the use of a third party data processing center 
however  the firm and its systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters  fire  terrorist acts  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins  computer viruses and similar events 
if our critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  we would have to accomplish these functions manually  which could temporarily impact our ability to identify business opportunities quickly  to maintain billing and clinical records reliably  and to bill for services efficiently 
in addition  we depend on third party vendors for certain functions whose future performance and reliability we can not warranty 
the firm s success depends upon retaining the services of its management team 
the firm is highly dependent on its management team and expects that continued success will depend largely upon their efforts and abilities 
the loss of the services of any key executive for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon the firm 
success also depends upon our ability to identify  develop  and retain qualified operating employees  particularly management  client servicing  and candidate recruiting employees 
the firm expends significant resources in the recruiting and training of its employees  as the pool of available applicants for these positions is limited 
the loss of some of our key operating employees could have an adverse effect on our operations  including our ability to establish and maintain client and candidate  professional and technical relationships 
the firm faces significant employment liability risk 
the firm employs and places people in the workplaces of other businesses 
an inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions  misuse of client proprietary information  misappropriation of funds  discrimination and harassment  employment of illegal aliens  theft of client property  other criminal activity  torts or other claims 
we have policies and guidelines in place to reduce our exposure to such risks 
however  failure of any employee or personnel to follow these policies and guidelines may result in negative publicity  injunctive relief  the payment by the firm of monetary damages or fines or other material adverse effects upon our business 
moreover  we could be held responsible for the actions at a workplace of persons not under our immediate control 
to reduce our exposure  we maintain insurance covering general liability  workers compensation claims  errors and omissions  and employee theft 
due to the nature of our assignments  in particular  access to client information systems and confidential information  and the potential liability with respect thereto  we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts adequate to cover any such liability on acceptable terms 
in addition  we face various employment related risks not covered by insurance  such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility 
significant legal actions  particularly relating to our healthcare staffing services  could subject the firm to substantial uninsured liabilities 
in recent years  healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal theories 
many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs 
in addition  we may be subject to claims related to torts or crimes committed by our employees or temporary staffing personnel 
in some instances  we are required to indemnify clients against some or all of these risks 
a failure of any of our employees or personnel to observe our policies and guidelines intended to reduce these risks  relevant client policies and guidelines or applicable federal  state or local laws  rules and regulations could result in negative publicity  payment of fines or other damages 
to protect ourselves from the cost of these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
our insurance coverage  however  may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
if we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage  we may be exposed to substantial liabilities 

table of contents currently  the firm is unable to recruit enough nurses to meet our clients demands for nurse staffing services  limiting the potential growth of our healthcare staffing business 
the firm relies on its ability to attract  develop  and retain nurses and other healthcare personnel who possess the skills  experience and licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our healthcare staffing clients 
we compete for healthcare staffing personnel with other temporary healthcare staffing companies  as well as actual and potential clients 
currently  there is a shortage of qualified nurses in most areas of the united states and competition for nursing personnel is increasing 
at this time  we do not have enough nurses to meet our clients demands for our nurse staffing services 
this shortage of nurses limits the firm s ability to grow our healthcare staffing business 
furthermore  we believe that the aging of the existing nurse population and declining enrollments in nursing schools will result in further competition for qualified nursing personnel 
if the firm becomes subject to material liabilities under our self insured programs  our financial results may be adversely affected 
the firm provides workers compensation coverage through a program that is partially self insured 
in addition  we provide medical coverage to our employees through a partially self insured preferred provider organization 
if we become subject to substantial uninsured workers compensation or medical coverage liabilities  our financial results may be adversely affected 
the firm may be adversely affected by government regulation of the staffing business 
our business is subject to regulation and licensing in many states 
while we have had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material 
if we fail to comply  such failure could materially adversely affect the firm s financial results 
the firm may be adversely affected by government regulation of the workplace 
part of our business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients workplaces 
increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer employee relationship could have a material adverse affect on the firm 
adverse results in tax audits could result in significant cash expenditures or exposure to unforeseen liabilities 
the firm is subject to periodic federal  state and local income tax audits for various tax years 
although the firm attempts to comply with all taxing authority regulations  adverse findings or assessments made by the taxing authorities as the result of an audit could have a material adverse affect on the firm 
future changes in reimbursement trends could hamper our clients ability to pay the firm 
many of the firm s healthcare clients are reimbursed under the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs for the services they provide 
in recent years  federal and state governments have made significant changes in these programs that have reduced government rates 
in addition  insurance companies and managed care organizations seek to control costs by requiring that healthcare providers  such as hospitals  discount their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans 
future federal and state legislation or evolving commercial reimbursement trends may further reduce  or change conditions for  our clients reimbursement 
limitations on reimbursement could reduce our clients cash flow  hampering their ability to pay us 
this situation could have a significant impact on our cash flow 
the firm s stock price may be volatile 
the firm s common stock is traded on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol kfrc 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including our operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the employment services industry  or other developments affecting us  our clients  or our competitors  some of which may be unrelated to our performance 
it is possible that the stock price may reach a level where we lose our eligibility to remain listed on nasdaq 
in addition  the stock market in general  especially the nasdaq national market tier  along with market prices for staffing companies  has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 

table of contents among other things  volatility in our stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices that they pay 
the volatility also could impair our ability in the future to offer common stock as a source of additional capital or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 
significant increases in payroll related costs could adversely affect the firm s business 
the firm is required to pay a number of federal  state  and local payroll and related costs  including unemployment taxes  workers compensation and insurance  fica  and medicare  among others  for our employees and personnel 
significant increases in the effective rates of any payroll related costs likely would have a material adverse effect upon the firm 
costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel 
recent federal and state legislative proposals have included provisions extending health insurance benefits to personnel who currently do not receive such benefits 
we may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs  if any such proposals are adopted 
provisions in the firm s articles and bylaws and under florida law may have certain anti takeover effects 
the firm s articles of incorporation and bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
in particular  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board of directors and permit the removal of directors only for cause 
additionally  management may issue up to million shares of preferred stock  and fix the rights and preferences thereof  without a further vote of the shareholders 
in addition  certain of our officers and managers have employment agreements containing certain provisions that call for substantial payments to be made to such employees in certain circumstances upon a change in control 
certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of kforce  including an acquisition in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
moreover  the existence of these provisions may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock 
risks relating to the proposed merger with hall kinion if the proposed merger is consummated  the firm may not achieve the benefits expected from the proposed merger with hall kinion  which may have a material adverse effect on the combined entity s business  financial and operating results 
kforce and hall kinion have entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the proposed merger will result in benefits to the combined entity arising out of the combination of sales and marketing leadership  general and administration functions and facilities plus the elimination of costs relating to hall kinion s status as a public reporting entity 
to realize any benefits from the proposed merger  the combined entity will have to adequately respond to the following post merger challenges expected cost savings and synergies from the proposed merger may not be realized  the management and employees of each entity  particularly the sales force  may not be retained and assimilated as expected  existing customers  strategic partners and suppliers of each entity may not be retained  and uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information systems between the two companies may not be successfully developed or maintained 
if the combined entity is not successful in addressing these and other challenges  then the benefits of the proposed merger may not be realized and  as a result  the combined entity s operating results and the market price of kforce s common stock may be adversely affected 
these challenges  if not successfully met by the combined entity  could result in possible unanticipated costs  diversion of management attention and loss of personnel 
the firm cannot give assurance that the combined entity will successfully integrate hall kinion s business with kforce s  or profitably manage the combined entity 
further  kforce cannot assure that the growth rate of the combined entity after the proposed merger will equal the historical growth rates experienced by kforce or hall kinion 

table of contents if the costs associated with the proposed merger exceed the benefits  the combined entity may experience an adverse financial result 
kforce and hall kinion have incurred significant transaction costs as a result of the proposed merger  including investment banking  legal and accounting fees  which may exceed current estimates 
in addition  it is expected that the combined entity will continue to incur consolidation and integration expenses which they cannot accurately estimate at this time 
actual transaction costs may substantially exceed current estimates and may affect the combined entity s financial condition and operating results negatively 
if the benefits of the proposed merger do not exceed the costs associated with the proposed merger  including any dilution to kforce s shareholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the proposed merger  the combined entity s financial results could be adversely affected 
the market price of kforce s common stock may decline if the proposed merger is consummated 
the market price of kforce s common stock may decline as a result of the proposed merger for a number of reasons  including if the integration of kforce and hall kinion is not completed in a timely and efficient manner  the combined entity does not achieve the perceived benefits of the proposed merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by stockholders and financial or industry analysts  the effect of the proposed merger on the combined entity s financial results is not consistent with the expectations of stockholders and financial or industry analysts  or significant stockholders of kforce or hall kinion decide to dispose of their stock following completion of the proposed merger 
sales of substantial amounts of kforce common stock in the public market after the proposed merger could materially adversely affect the market price of kforce common stock 
kforce expects to issue a significant number of shares of kforce common stock to hall kinion stockholders in the proposed merger dependent on the kforce stock market value at the time of closing of the proposed merger 
the sale of substantial amounts of kforce common stock may result in significant fluctuations in the price of kforce common stock and could cause kforce s common stock price to fall 
the sale of these shares could also impair the combined entity s ability to raise capital through sales of additional common stock 
kforce and hall kinion may not complete the proposed merger 
kforce has notified hall kinion that it believes certain conditions exist or will exist that have or will have a material adverse effect on hall kinion 
hall kinion has informed kforce that it disagrees with kforce s position  has suspended kforce s access to its personnel and has requested that kforce s board of directors confirm its intention to recommend the proposed transaction to the kforce shareholders 
at a march  special meeting of kforce s board of directors concerning the transaction  the board considered hall kinion s request  but did not reconfirm its intention to recommend the proposed merger to kforce shareholders 
accordingly  kforce believes that there is a great deal of uncertainty relating to the proposed merger and that there can be no assurance that it will be consummated 
if a merger does proceed  the terms may be substantially revised 
the proposed merger may not be completed unless kforce s registration statement on form s is declared effective by the sec  and the stockholders of kforce and hall kinion approve the merger 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will be met 
additionally  the merger agreement grants to kforce and hall kinion certain rights and imposes obligations  including rights to terminate the merger agreement 
if we fail to complete the merger for any reason  we will have made significant expenditures and expended significant management time on an unsuccessful project 
depending upon the circumstances of the termination  we may not be entitled to any breakup fee to offset some of these expenditures and under certain circumstances  we might be obligated to pay hall kinion a million breakup fee 
uncertainty regarding the proposed merger and the effects of the proposed merger could cause each entity s customers or strategic partners to delay or defer decisions 
kforce s and or hall kinion s customers and strategic partners  in response to the completion of the proposed merger  may delay or defer decisions regarding the use of the combined entity s services  which could have a material adverse effect on the business of the combined entity 

table of contents risks relating primarily to the business and operations of kforce following the proposed merger the current economic downturn has adversely affected the demand for the services of the onstaff unit of hall kinion 
in the real estate services industry served by the onstaff unit of hall kinion  the demand for professional personnel is strongly influenced by the volume of mortgage financing  both for new units and re financings 
the volume is very sensitive to interest rates and other general economic conditions 
increases in interest rates or other economic factors could have a significant negative impact on our business in this field 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted if demand for our services in any new geographic markets we enter is less than we anticipate  if our new offices are not profitable in a timely manner or if we fail to hire qualified employees 
the firm s growth depends in part on our ability to enter new vertical or geographic markets successfully 
this expansion is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to develop  recruit and maintain a base of qualified professionals within a new geographic market  initiate  develop and sustain corporate client relationships in each new vertical or geographic market  attract  hire  integrate and retain qualified sales and sales support employees  and accurately assess the demand of a new market 
the addition of offices and entry into new geographic markets may not occur on a timely basis or achieve anticipated financial results 
the addition of new offices and entry into new vertical or geographic markets typically result in increases in operating expenses  primarily due to increased employee headcount 
expenses are incurred in advance of forecasted revenue  and there is typically a delay before our new employees reach full productivity 
additionally  demand for our services in new markets that we enter might also be less than we anticipate 
if we are unable to enter new vertical or geographic markets in a cost effective manner or if demand for our services in new markets does not meet or exceed our forecasts  our business  operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
in  and  we closed and consolidated offices to improve efficiency  and further closures or consolidation may occur depending on market and competitive conditions
