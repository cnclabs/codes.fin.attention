item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors that may affect future results the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected the matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these same factors could cause our future financial performance in fiscal and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statements 
these factors include decline in demand for our merchandise  our ability to achieve our business plans  expected cash flow from operations  vendor and their factor relations  flow of merchandise  compliance with our credit agreements  our ability to strengthen our liquidity and increase our credit availability  the availability of desirable store locations on suitable terms  changes in consumer spending patterns  marketing strategies  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  changes in weather patterns  changes in existing or potential duties  tariffs or quotas  paper and printing costs  the ability to hire and train associates and development of management information systems 
our operations have been historically seasonal  with a disproportionate amount of sales and a majority of net income occurring in the back to school and christmas selling seasons for value city and filene s basement 
dsw seasonal sales occur both in early spring and fall 
as a result of seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during these periods  including adverse weather  the timing and level of markdowns or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization  recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the calculation of retirement benefits  estimates for self insurance reserves for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance  income taxes  contingencies  litigation and revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial and appraisal techniques 
we constantly re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
while we believe that our historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
as the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe the following represent the most critical estimates and assumptions  among others  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection  application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
revenues from our retail operations are recognized at the latter of point of sale or the delivery of goods to the customer 
retail revenues are reduced by a provision for anticipated returns based on historical trends 
cost of sales and merchandise inventories 
we use the retail method of accounting for substantially all of our merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out basis  or market  using the retail inventory method 
the retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as merchandise is marked down prior to sale 
reserves to value inventory at the lower of cost or market were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
inherent in the calculation of inventories are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  setting the original merchandise retail value or markon  markups of initial prices established  reduction of pricing due to customer s value perception or perceived value known as markdowns  and estimates of losses between physical inventory counts or shrinkage  which  combined with the averaging process within the retail method  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margins 
long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of the related long lived asset and reduce the carrying value by the excess where the recorded value exceeds the fair value 
during fiscal  we recorded a million charge related to long lived assets at store operating units 
during fiscal  we recorded two different charges related to long lived assets 
the first charge was for goodwill impairment as a result of the implementation of sfas  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but would be subject to annual fair value based impairment tests 
the initial tests for goodwill impairment  as of february   resulted in a non cash charge of million  million net of taxes  which is reported in our consolidated statement of operations as of february  in the caption cumulative effect of accounting change 
substantially all of the charge relates to goodwill associated with our purchase of mazel s interest in vcm and is included in the net loss for the year ended february  at the end of the current fiscal year we have on our books million of goodwill subject to annual testing 
the second charge of million related to long lived assets at store operating units 
the result of reviewing undiscounted cash flows for stores under sfas  identified stores where the recorded value of the asset exceeded the fair value 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates 
self insurance reserves 
we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
these estimates are based on actuarial assumptions and are subject to change based on actual results 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated for costs of certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
pension 
the obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield on fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at january   the weighted average actuarial assumption of our plans were discount rate  assumed salary increases and long term rate of return on plan assets 
to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
customer loyalty program 
we maintain a customer loyalty program for our dsw operations in which customers receive a future discount on qualifying purchases 
the reward your style program is designed to promote customer awareness and loyalty plus provide the company with the ability to communicate with our customers and enhance our understanding of their spending trends 
upon reaching the target level  customers may redeem these discounts on a future purchase 
generally  these future discounts must be redeemed in one year 
we accrue the estimated costs of the anticipated redemptions of the discount earned at the time of the initial purchase and charge such costs to selling  general and administrative expense based on historical experience 
the estimates of the costs associated with the loyalty program require us to make assumptions related to customer purchase levels and redemption rates 
the accrued liability as of january  and february  was million and million  respectively 
to the extent assumptions of purchases and redemption rates vary from actual results  earnings would be impacted 
income taxes 
we do business in numerous jurisdictions that impose taxes 
management is required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount which will be currently payable based upon tax statutes of each jurisdiction 
the estimation process involves adjusting income determined by the application of generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
if different management judgments had been made  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could be different 
during fiscal  we established a reserve for deferred income tax assets of million for carry forwards related to state and local net operating losses and for excess contribution carry forwards 
see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f of this annual report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
results of operations we operate three business segments 
value city and filene s basement segments operate full line  off price department stores 
our dsw segment sells better branded off price shoes and accessories

consolidated gross profit increased million from million to  million  and increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
value city s gross profit decrease is primarily attributable to lower average unit retail prices as a result of lower initial markups during the year

the year ended january  includes approximately million for store closings  a million increase in advertising and million in pre opening costs for new stores 
new store openings in the period were limited to our dsw and filene s basement segments 
preparations for opening a dsw store or a filene s basement store generally take eight to ten weeks 
pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
it has been our experience that new stores for each of our segments generally achieve profitability and contribute to net income after the first full year of operations 
pre opening expense for the new dsw stores was million in fiscal compared to million for the new stores opened in prior year 
pre opening expense was million in each of fiscal and for the new filene s basement store opened in each of those periods

sales for the fifty two weeks ended february  fiscal  increased by to billion from billion in the fifty two week period of fiscal by segment  comparable store sales were value city department stores dsw filene s basement total the comparable store sales percentage declines were attributable to a highly competitive and promotional retail environment and the effects of a softening economy

dsw reflected a slightly negative comparable store rate as overall sales rose almost million to million for the year 
the dsw increase in fiscal included a net increase of stores 
the filene s basement segment s sales increased million to million for fiscal including a slight increase in comparative store sale percentage 
filene s basement total stores opened remained unchanged due to a single opening and a single closing during the fiscal year 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit increased million from million to million  and increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
the value city segment s gross profit improvement is primarily the result of improved initial merchandise costs negotiated with vendors and higher retail offering in our stores 
additionally  value city increased control over inventory quantities and markdowns and reduced the loss associated with shrink from the prior year 
gross profit for our dsw segment improved as a result of higher initial markups on merchandise purchases and a reduction in markdowns 
our filene s basement segment s gross profit was negatively affected by early and excess markdowns required to sell and reduce inventories 
gross profit  as a percent of sales by segment  was value city department stores dsw filene s basement total sg a

our fifty two week period ended february  includes approximately million for fasb write off  million related to write off of unamortized debt costs  million for store closings  million for severance costs related to workforce reductions during the year and the relocation of our value city merchandising office from boston to new york 
the relocation of the value city buyers from boston to new york city provides merchants with a closer proximity to our markets and vendors 
in addition  we evaluated stores with negative or inadequate cash flows to determine if any assets were impaired 
new store openings in the period were limited to our dsw and filene s basement segments 
preparations for opening a dsw store or a filene s basement store generally take eight to ten weeks 
pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
it has been our experience that new stores for each of our segments generally achieve profitability and contribute to net income after the first full year of operations 
no value city stores were opened less than twelve months during fiscal twenty two dsw stores were opened less than twelve months in fiscal and had a pre tax net operating loss of million  including million of pre opening expenses 
twenty six dsw stores were opened less than twelve months during fiscal and had a pre tax net operating loss of million  including million of pre opening expenses

overall license fees and other income decreased million in fiscal license fees decreased million  or  from million to million  as a result of lower sales from unrelated licensees 
fees from the vcm joint venture of million in fiscal  did not occur in fiscal because the operations were consolidated in fiscal as a result of the purchase of our partner s interest in the vcm joint venture at the close of business on february  other income decreased million  or  from million to million 
other income is comprised of layaway fees and vending income 
these sources of income vary based on customer traffic and contractual arrangements 
operating profit 
operating profit increased to million in fiscal from a loss of million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of net sales from a loss of in fiscal to a profit of in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million from million to million due primarily to an increase in interest rates as a result of new term debt  offset partially by a decrease in average borrowings 
interest expense also included amortization of debt discount of million 
equity in loss of joint venture 
equity in loss of joint venture in fiscal of million was the result of operations in the vcm joint venture with mazel 
we acquired mazel s interest in vcm at the close of business february  and have included the operations of these departments in the consolidated statements presented 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
we also implemented a new accounting principle during fiscal resulting in the impairment of goodwill 
the charge for the application of the new principle was million net of tax  or of sales 
we retained a valuation professional to assist in the calculation of impairment 
our initial test was performed as of the beginning of the fiscal year while our annual test occurred in the middle of the fourth quarter 
goodwill will be subject to annual impairment tests and results of such tests cannot be predicted 
seasonality our business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail businesses 
historically  the majority of our sales and operating profit have been generated during the back to school and christmas selling seasons for our value city segment and  more recently  our filene s basement segment 
the shoe business experiences increased sales in both early spring and fall seasons in relationship to the change in footwear desired by the dsw customer 
fiscal year we follow a week fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest to january fiscal  and each contain weeks 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal the effective tax benefits are negatively impacted due to the increase in non deductible expenses for tax purposes associated with the amortization of the warrants issued in connection with our long term debt 
during our fiscal year ended january   we established a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets of million 
the reserve reflects a reduction in the estimated amount for future tax deductions  primarily for state and local taxes and excess contribution carry forwards 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal there was an increase in the effective tax rate primarily due to the increase in non deductible expenses for tax purposes and the fluctuation in taxable income 
however  that increase was then off set by the tax effect of the write off of financing costs 
adoption of accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb periodically issues statements of financial accounting standards sfas  some of which require implementation by a date falling within or after the close of the fiscal year 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
under this statement  obligations that meet the definition of a liability will be recognized consistently with the retirement of the associated tangible long lived assets 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we assessed the impact of sfas no 
and there was none 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
however  it did require that the company reclassify the loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately million from extraordinary loss to selling  general and administrative expense  in the company s consolidated financial statement of operations in fiscal in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of certain entities considered to be variable interest entities vies 
an entity is considered to be a vie when it has equity investors who lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest  or its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
consolidation of a vie by an investor is required when it is determined that the investor will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns if they occur 
fin provides certain exceptions to these rules  relating to qualifying special purpose entities qspe s subject to the requirements of sfas no 
upon its original issuance  fin required that vies created after january  would be consolidated immediately  while vies created prior to february  were to be consolidated as of july  in october  the fasb deferred the effective date for consolidation of vies created prior to february  to december  for calendar year end companies  with earlier application encouraged 
in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the original interpretation and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
fin r provides special effective date provisions to enterprises that fully or partially applied to fin prior to the issuance of the revised interpretation 
in particular  entities that have already adopted fin are not required to adopt fin r until the quarterly reporting period ended may  the company is currently reviewing the provisions of fin r and will adopt fin r for the quarterly reporting period ending may  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances  many of which were previously classified as equity 
this statement was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and for pre existing instruments as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  initial adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor addressed the accounting treatment for vendor allowances 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
in did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation because of the nature of the estimates required  management believes that the effect of inflation  if any  on the results of operations and financial condition has been minor  however  there can be no assurance that the business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store inventory purchases  capital expenditures in connection with expansion and remodeling and infrastructure growth  primarily information technology development 
the primary sources of funds for these liquidity needs are cash flow from operations and credit facilities 
our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall  peaking during the holiday selling season 
net working capital was million and million at january  and february   respectively 
current ratios at those dates were and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the net cash decrease is reflective of several items  primarily the increase in inventory of million  the reduction in accounts payable of million and the reduction of accrued expenses of million  which were funded from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the increases in inventories for new stores were million for dsw  million for licensed departments and million for the opening of filene s basement 
cash used for capital expenditures was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  capital expenditures included million for new stores  million for improvements in existing stores  million for office  warehousing and operations of our shoe business and million for mis equipment upgrades and new systems 
a source of cash from investing activity was proceeds from lease incentives which are amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the lease 
on june   value city department stores  inc  together with certain other principal subsidiaries of retail ventures  inc  entered into a million refinancing that consists of three separate credit facilities collectively  the credit facilities i a three year million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  ii two million term loan facilities provided equally by cerberus partners  lp and schottenstein stores corporation the term loans  and iii an amended and re stated million senior subordinated convertible loan  initially entered into by us on march   which is held equally by cerberus partners  lp and ssc the convertible loan 
these credit facilities are guaranteed by retail ventures  inc and substantially all of its subsidiaries 
we are not subject to any financial covenants under these credit facilities  however  there are numerous restrictive covenants relating to our management and operation 
these non financial covenants include  among other restrictions  limitations on indebtedness  guarantees  mergers  acquisitions  fundamental corporate changes  financial reporting requirements  budget approval  disposition of assets  investments  loans and advances  liens  dividends  stock purchases  transactions with affiliates  issuance of securities and the payment of and modification to debt instruments 
these credit facilities are also subject to an intercreditor agreement  which provides for an established order of payment of obligations from the proceeds of collateral upon default the intercreditor agreement 
million revolving credit facility under the revolving credit facility  the borrowing base formula is structured in a manner that allows us and our subsidiaries availability based on the value of inventories and receivables 
primary security for the revolving credit facility is provided by a first priority lien on all of our inventory and accounts receivable  as well as certain intercompany notes and payment intangibles 
subject to the intercreditor agreement  the revolving credit facility also has a second priority perfected interest in all of the collateral securing the term loans 
interest on borrowings is calculated at the bank s base rate or eurodollar rate plus to  depending upon the level of average excess availability we maintain 
the maturity date is june  at january  and february   million and million were available  respectively  under the revolving credit facility 
direct borrowings aggregated million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  while million and million letters of credit were issued and outstanding for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
million term loans related parties the term loans are comprised of a million term loan b and a million term loan c 
all obligations under the term loans are senior debt and  subject to the intercreditor agreement  have the same rights and privileges as the revolving credit facility and the convertible loan 
we and our principal subsidiaries are obligated on the facility 
the maturity date is june  the term loans stated rate of interest per annum during the initial two years is if paid in cash and if we elect a paid in kind pik option 
during the first two years of the term loans  we may pay all interest in pik 
during the final year of the term loans  the stated rate of interest is if paid in cash or if pik  and the pik option is limited to of the interest due 
for the years ended january  and february   we elected to pay interest in cash 
we issued  warrants warrants to purchase shares of common stock  at an initial exercise price of per share  to the term loan c lenders 
the warrants are exercisable at any time prior to june  we have granted the term loan c lenders registration rights with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
the million value ascribed to the warrants was estimated as of the date of issuance using the black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions risk free interest rate of  expected life of years  expected volatility of  illiquidity discount of  and an expected dividend yield of 
the related debt discount is amortized into interest expense over the life of the debt 
the number of shares issuable varies upon the occurrence of the following i the issuance of additional shares of common stock without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the warrant exercise price  ii the declaration of any dividend  iii the combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock into a lesser number of shares  iv the issuance or sale of additional shares at a price per share less than the current market price but greater than the warrant exercise price  v the issuance of convertible securities which are convertible into shares of common stock  and or vi the exchange of shares in a merger or other business combination 
million senior subordinated convertible loan related parties we have amended and restated our million convertible loan dated march  as amended  borrowings under the convertible loan will bear interest at per annum 
at our option  interest may be pik during the first two years  and thereafter  at our option  up to of the interest due may be pik until maturity 
pik interest accrued with respect to the convertible loan is added to the outstanding principal balance  on a quarterly basis  and is payable in cash upon the maturity of the debt 
the convertible loan is guaranteed by all principal subsidiaries and is secured by a lien on assets junior to liens granted in favor of the revolving credit facility and term loans 
the convertible loan is not prepayable until june   and has a maturity date of june  the agent has the right to designate two observers to our board of directors for so long as the agent is the beneficial owner of at least of the advances initially made by it and has the right to designate two individuals to our board of directors for so long as the agent is the beneficial owner of at least of the conversion shares issued or issuable upon conversion of the advances initially made by it 
the convertible loan is convertible at the option of the holders into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
achievement of expected cash flows from operations and compliance with the restrictive covenants of our credit agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon a number of factors  including the attainment of sales  gross profit  expense levels  vendor relations  and flow of merchandise that are consistent with our financial projections 
future limitations of credit availability by factor organizations and or vendors will restrict our ability to obtain merchandise and services and may impair operating results 
although operating results for fiscal were negative  we believe that cash generated by operations  along with the available proceeds from our credit agreements and other sources of financing  will be sufficient to meet our obligations for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to meet our projections 
further  there is no assurance that extended financing will be available in the future if we fail to meet our projections or on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  as defined by the u 
s 
securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction

in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at january   direct borrowings aggregated million 
the revolving credit facility permits debt commitments up to million  matures on june  and generally bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus to based on the average excess availability during the previous quarter 
we have used interest rate swap agreements to effectively establish long term fixed rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility  thus reducing a portion of our interest rate risk 
these swap agreements  which are designated as cash flow hedges  involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements 
at january   we had no outstanding swap agreements 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates  net of taxes  would have an approximate million impact to our financial position  liquidity and results of operation
