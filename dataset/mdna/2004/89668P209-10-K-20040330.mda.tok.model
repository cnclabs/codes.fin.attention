item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote segment reporting in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
industry background the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act was enacted principally to foster competition in the local telecommunications markets 
the telecommunications act imposes a variety of duties upon the ilecs  including the duty to provide other communications companies  like us  with access to the individual components of their networks  called network elements  on an unbundled basis at any feasible point and at rates and on terms and conditions that are just  reasonable and nondiscriminatory 
a network element is a facility or piece of equipment of the ilec s network or the features  functions or capabilities such facility or equipment provides 
pursuant to the telecommunications act  the federal communications commission fcc has mandated that incumbent local exchange carriers provide access to a set of unbundled network elements including  among other elements  local loops ie the wires that reach from the ilec central office to the end user s premises  switching  transport and signaling 
this set of elements is referred to as the unbundled network element platform or une p 
moreover  the fcc has mandated that ilecs must provide the unbundled network element platform at rates based on a forward looking  total long run incremental cost methodology 
a recent court ruling has overturned  in part  fcc decisions relating to une p 
this ruling could have immediate  material  adverse effects upon our business 
see sections entitled government regulation and risks relating to our financial condition and our business 
the telecommunications act also establishes procedures by which the regional bell operating companies bell operating companies are allowed to handle in region long distance calls  that is  calls that originate from within their telephone service areas and terminate outside their service areas 
the court order that divided at t prohibited bell operating companies from providing in region long distance telephone service 
under the telecommunications act  bell operating companies can provide such in region service if they demonstrate to the fcc and state regulatory agencies that they have complied with a point regulatory checklist  including offering interconnection to other communications companies  like us  and providing those companies access to their unbundled network elements on terms approved by a state public service commission 
bell operating companies have received authority to provide in region long distance services in all applicable states 
however  the section checklist is a continuing obligation pursuant to section d of the telecommunications act 
see section of this report entitled government regulation 
retail services we provide telephone services at both the retail and wholesale level 
at the retail level our principal services are z linehome  z linebusiness and touch long distance 
we plan to launch a new generation of voip based services in 
table of contents z linehome z linehome is local residential telephone service bundled with long distance telephone service  calling card services and enhanced features  including our own proprietary  internet accessible voicemail  find me  notify me and voice activated services  as well as caller identification  call forwarding  three way calling  call waiting and speed dialing  all for a single flat monthly price 
we offer various plans  including our unlimited plan which includes unlimited  nationwide  direct dialed long distance calling toll free and lower priced plans that include a limited number of long distance minutes at no additional charge 
bell operating company customers switching to z linehome keep their existing phone numbers 
we currently offer z linehome in every state except alaska  in areas served by bell operating companies and selected areas served by sprint or formerly served by gte 
z linehome includes unique z line features  all of which can be accessed and manipulated by telephone or internet 
our proprietary voicemail enables z linehome subscribers to retrieve and listen to their voice mail messages via telephone or the internet 
our voicemail system also enables users to forward voicemails via e mail  as attachments 
our find me feature forwards an incoming call to as many as three additional numbers 
our notify me feature notifies the subscriber via e mail  pager or icq internet chat instant messaging when a new voice mail message arrives 
both find me and notify me are accessible via the internet so that users may easily enable  disable or otherwise alter the functions 
personal voice assistant or pva allows users to store contacts in a virtual address book and then access and utilize that information through voice commands from any telephone 
users say call and the contact s name  call john doe  for example  and pva connects the call 
pva users can also send voice e mails 
users record a message via telephone and instruct pva to deliver the message to a contact 
pva then attaches the voice message to an e mail and sends the e mail to the contact 
we market and sell z linehome primarily through joint marketing efforts with entities that have access to large numbers of consumers  independent sale contractors including multi level marketing companies and referral programs 
we also use  but have reduced our reliance upon  direct mail and traditional advertising media such as billboards  radio and television 
z linebusiness z linebusiness is our complementary service to z linehome targeted to small and medium sized businesses typically having four or fewer lines and businesses having multiple units 
z linebusiness  like z linehome  is local telephone service bundled with long distance telephone service  calling card services and enhanced features  including our proprietary features 
because we offer service in nearly every state  z linebusiness is particularly valuable to firms having multiple locations in various states 
with us  they deal with only one telephone company 
we began offering z linebusiness in we offer z linebusiness in every state but alaska  in areas served by a bell operating company or formerly served by gte 
current customers include darden restaurants  compass  foot locker  metromedia restaurant group and rand mcnally stores 
we market and sell z linebusiness primarily through our own in house sales personnel and independent sale contractors 
touch long distance touch long distance is a usage based service that allows customers to use us as their primary long distance calling provider to complete their residential long distance calls 
touch long distance is available nationwide 
we do not actively market the service 
we acquired touch communications  inc touch in april voip services we plan to launch an offering of broadband voice and data services in we expect to focus initially on the small to medium business market and multiple dwelling units  such as condominiums  apartment buildings and hotels  in georgia and florida 
our voip services will be integrated with our enhanced communications services platform so that in addition to increased bandwidth and service flexibility  our customers will enjoy features such as pva  our voice activated virtual address book 
we expect to utilize cisco technology and services in providing these services 
billing and collection we have three primary methods for billing and collecting from our retail customers 
for our z linehome customers  we can direct bill by mail and receive payment through a check or money order by mail  charge a credit card account or set up an automatic withdrawal from a checking account 
currently  we bill the majority of our customers by mail and receive payment through checks delivered by mail 
wholesale services at the wholesale level  we offer a comprehensive package of communications and advanced support services to other communications companies for their use in providing services to their own retail customers 
among the wholesale services we offer are local exchange telephone services  long distance telephone services  our proprietary enhanced features  supplemental features 
table of contents we acquire from incumbent local exchange carriers  ordering  provisioning ie the process by which a telephone company is established as the end user s primary telephone company  inbound sales  fulfillment  billing  collections and customer care 
our enhanced communications platform has the capability to integrate with most communications transport networks  including wireless  cable  and internet networks 
we intend to pursue wholesale relationships with  among others  wireless telephone companies  internet service providers  cable television operators  electrical utilities and others having access to large consumer bases 
to provide telephone services these entities must be properly licensed by regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate 
on february   we signed a non exclusive  wholesale services agreement with the sprint communications company lp sprint 
the agreement gives sprint access to our telephone exchange services and our web integrated  enhanced communications platform and operational support systems in connection with sprint s local residential telephone service 
sprint is our primary wholesale services customer 
on march   we entered into a four year contract with mci worldcom communications  inc mci whereby we agreed to provide local exchange services  enhanced features and operational and support services and licenses to use certain of our proprietary technology  all for mci s use in providing telecommunications services to residential and small business customers 
mci filed for bankruptcy protection on july  on november   we significantly amended the terms of our agreement to alter the fee structure and to eliminate certain exclusivity provisions 
mci terminated the agreement effective october  operations support systems we have invested heavily in our operations systems and support platform 
the platform integrates ordering  provisioning  customer care and billing functionality throughout the customer lifecycle and consequently gives us and our wholesale customers reliable  flexible  low cost operational capabilities 
we believe our operational systems are scalable  both vertically and horizontally 
they have the capability to integrate with wireline  wireless  cable  internet and other communications transport networks our current generation of telephone services requires access to ilec networks 
to facilitate interaction with the ilecs  we have established  with outside integration and consulting assistance  electronic gateways  software and a standard internal provisioning interface 
our systems can interact with the ordering systems of multiple incumbent local exchange carriers 
they reduce the number of steps required to provision a customer and consequently reduces costs and increases accuracy 
provisioning is the process by which we or our wholesale customers are established as the end user s primary local exchange and long distance telephone service provider 
our systems also support mediation  network administration and revenue assurance 
business strategy our basic business strategy is to increase lines under management and leverage our existing facilities and infrastructure by establishing wholesale and joint marketing relationships with organizations having access to large consumer bases  particularly those having the capability to bundle communication services reduce bad debt and customer churn by focusing our retail marketing efforts on business customers and select groups of qualified consumers initiate voip based services for consumers and businesses 
material changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate  particularly in light of a recent court ruling overturning  in part  fcc rules  could cause us to dramatically alter our business strategy 
see sections entitled government regulation and risks relating to our financial condition and our business 
government regulation overview some of our services are regulated and some are not 
in providing enhanced features services such as voice mail  find me notification and directory services  we operate as an unregulated provider of information services  as that term is defined in the communications act of the communications act  as amended by the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act  and as an enhanced service provider  as that term is defined in the fcc rules 
these operations currently are not regulated by the fcc or the states in which we operate 
in providing z linehome and our long distance services  we are regulated as a common carrier at the state and federal level and are subject to additional rules and policies not applicable to providers of information services alone 
we are certificated as a competitive local exchange carrier in 
table of contents states alaska excluded and the district of columbia 
z tel is certificated as a long distance reseller in all fifty states and the district of columbia 
the local and long distance telecommunications services we provide are regulated by federal  state  and  to some extent  local government authorities 
the fcc has jurisdiction over all telecommunications common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services 
each state regulatory commission has jurisdiction over the same carriers with respect to intrastate communications services 
the extent of federal or state regulation of information services depends upon the nature of the service offered 
local governments sometimes seek to impose franchise requirements on telecommunications carriers and regulate construction activities involving public rights of way 
changes to the regulations imposed by any of these regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in recent years  the regulation of the telecommunications industry has been in a state of flux as the united states congress and various state legislatures have passed laws seeking to foster greater competition in telecommunications markets 
the fcc and state utility commissions have adopted many new rules to implement this legislation and encourage competition 
these changes  which are still incomplete  have created new opportunities and challenges for us and our competitors 
the following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is intended to describe the most important  but not all  present and proposed federal  state and local regulations and legislation affecting the telecommunications industry 
some of these and other existing federal and state regulations are the subject of judicial proceedings and legislative and administrative proposals that could change  in varying degrees  the manner in which our industry operates 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings or their impact on the telecommunications industry at this time 
some of these future legislative  regulatory or judicial changes may have a material adverse impact on our business 
while z tel s regulatory environment continues to be dynamic and complex  there are two overriding issues that substantially drive our business our ability to access the local networks of incumbent local telephone companies like verizon  sbc  bellsouth and qwest and the price we pay for that access 
both of those issues network access and pricing are currently subject to significant legal uncertainty 
with regard to network access rules  as discussed more fully below  access to ilec unbundled network elements pursuant to section of the telecommunications act is currently subject to considerable legal uncertainty 
in particular  our access to unbundled analog switching  a key component of the unbundled network element platform combination of elements  or une p  is the subject of litigation by our bell company competitors and other incumbent local exchange carriers 
we are dependent upon use of une p for approximately of our revenue 
in  in the triennial review order  the federal communications commission fcc ruled that entrants like z tel would be able to purchase analog switching and dedicated transport on an unbundled basis  subject to state by state review of whether such unbundling was needed in their states 
while those state by state proceedings were taking place  on march   the dc circuit court of appeals overturned the fcc s decision as an improper delegation of authority to state public utility commissions 
see report and order and order on remand and further notice of proposed rulemaking  review of section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers  fcc rcd triennial review order  rev d in part and remanded  united states telecom ass n v 
fcc  nos 
  et al 
dc cir 
march  usta ii 
the dc circuit ordered that the unbundled switching and transport rules be vacated the later of sixty days or upon denial of a petition for rehearing  whichever is later 
a majority of the fcc has indicated it will support an appeal of this decision 
z tel is weighing its legal options with regard to this opinion  as are other competitive carriers 
if the usta ii decision is not stayed or reversed  it could have immediate  significant  adverse and material impact upon our business  and ilecs might utilize the reversal of the unbundling rules to deny us access to their local networks 
we depend upon such access to provide our services to our customers 
we believe that in the event the rules are vacated without any replacement by either the fcc or the state commissions  we have interconnection agreements with our principal incumbent local telephone company suppliers including verizon  sbc  bellsouth and qwest that will permit us to continue to obtain access to local network elements during any intervening time period 
however  it is possible that any or all of those incumbent local telephone company suppliers will refuse to abide by the terms of those agreements or terminate those agreements 
z tel is currently evaluating all of its legal options to ensure that we can continue to meet the needs of our existing and future customers 
see section entitled risks relating to our financial condition and our business 
with regard to pricing  states and the fcc are currently re evaluating the pricing of network elements 
as a result  it is possible that prices in some states could increase or lower rates from existing levels 
currently  the incumbent local exchange carriers verizon  bellsouth  sbc and qwest have rate cases pending before state regulatory commissions in at least one state in each of their respective territories 
in particular  ongoing rate cases in illinois  ohio and michigan could significantly raise the existing rates for some network elements and network element combinations 
our intent is to be an active participant in many of these rate cases and any others that might be critical to our operations 
we anticipate joining other competitive service providers in arguing that existing rates and rates proposed by the incumbents are overstated and do not reflect the true total element long run incremental costing principles required by the fcc and the telecommunications act 
the fcc  in docket no 
is currently reevaluating its prescribed methodology for calculating unbundled network element rates 
in the verizon v 
fcc decision  the us supreme court affirmed the fcc s current pricing methodology  called total element long run incremental cost  or 
table of contents telric 
the current fcc rulemaking proposes to modify the telric methodology by mandating that states set prices based upon the forward looking costs of operating the existing network architecture of incumbent local telephone company networks 
in many instances  modifying the telric methodology in this way could increase the rates we pay for certain elements and result in lower rates for other elements 
we believe that the fcc s proposals to modify telric are inconsistent with the supreme court s decision in the verizon case  meaning that new fcc telric rules may be subject to considerable litigation if they are adopted 
while the prevailing productivity trends within the industry would predict the adoption of lower rates in association with the provision of unbundled network elements and network element combinations  we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or potential rate case or judicial proceeding 
increases or decreases in rate levels charged by incumbent local exchange carriers as a result of regulatory and or judicial review through rate case  court case or arbitration proceedings could significantly impact our business plans 
federal regulation fcc policy on enhanced  information services and internet protocol enabled services such as voice over internet protocol on march   the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking that seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for internet protocol enabled services  or ip enabled services 
ip enabled services include voice over internet protocol services and other services that z tel intends to deploy or may in the future deploy 
the fcc proposed that ip enabled services be subject to limited regulation and that inconsistent state and local regulation would be preempted 
under the fcc s proposal  the regulation that survives would be tied to the particular functionality offered by the service provider 
for example  the application of emergency services may be different for dial tone like services than for the voice capabilities of interactive computer games 
the fcc ip enabled services proceeding builds upon several decades of precedent in which the fcc has largely sought to wall off from regulation certain enhanced or information services 
in  the fcc created a distinction between basic telecommunications services  which it regulates as common carrier services  and enhanced services  which remain unregulated 
the fcc exempted enhanced service providers from federal regulations governing common carriers  including the obligation to pay access charges for the origination or termination of calls on carrier networks and the obligation to contribute to the universal service fund 
the telecommunications act of established a similar distinction between telecommunications services and information services 
the distinction between information services and common carrier services is important in many respects 
federal tariffs  state certification requirements and even local regulation franchise or rights of way fees apply to common carrier services but not necessarily all information services 
under fcc rules  interstate common carriers must contribute a percentage of revenue to federal universal service support systems  information service providers do not make such a contribution 
at the same time  common carriers are granted certain rights that information service providers do not have for example  only common carriers have the ability to colocate equipment and purchase unbundled network elements from incumbent local telephone companies pursuant to section of the telecommunications act 
interexchange common carriers eg  long distance providers generally have to pay access charges to local exchange companies for long distance calls that originate or terminate on a local exchange carrier s local network 
information service providers such as an internet service provider do not pay these access charges when their customers utilize local exchange carrier networks to utilize the information service provider s service 
as discussed above  since z tel offers both common carrier and information services to its customers  these distinctions have an important impact upon our business 
changing technology and changing market conditions  however  sometimes make it difficult to discern the boundary between unregulated and regulated services 
in particular  the ability to place and route voice communications over information service provider networks eg the internet has called into question the fcc s common carrier information service provider distinction 
in  the fcc outlined in a report to congress its belief that voice over internet services should be classified and regulated  if at all  on a case by case basis 
since that report  several companies have filed petitions seeking declarations from the fcc as to the regulatory status of voip services 
in february  the fcc ruled that pulver 
com s free world dialup service was an information service and not a regulated common carrier service because free world dialup did not offer its users the ability to transmit calls for a fee 
currently pending before the fcc is a petition by at t requesting that certain of its long distance services that utilize ip technology be regulated as an information service  and therefore not be subject to pay access charges to local exchange carriers 
also pending before the fcc is a petition by level communications that seeks forbearance of certain access charge rules that have certain of level s ip enabled services pay local termination rates rather than interstate access charges 
in general  information services are value added services that use regulated transmission facilities only as part of a service package that also includes network or computer software to change or enhance the information transmitted 
we believe that most of the enhanced features we provide  including voice mail  find me notification  and directory services  are information services under the fcc s definition 
because the regulatory boundaries in this area are somewhat unclear and subject to dispute  however  the fcc could seek to characterize some of our information services as telecommunications services or subject them to certain types 
table of contents of regulation applicable to common carrier telecommunications services 
if that happens  those services would become subject to fcc regulation  although the impact of that reclassification is difficult to predict 
in addition  certain of z tel s planned voip based services could be classified as information services in a way that could potentially limit our ability to access the local networks of incumbent local telephone companies 
as described above  only common carriers have rights to colocate or purchase unbundled network elements from incumbent local telephone companies 
it is unclear how or when the fcc ip enabled services proceeding will conclude 
on february   the fcc adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking in cc docket no 
that proposed to classify ilec wireline broadband internet access services as information services and regulate the provision of such services pursuant to title i of the communications act of in addition  the fcc sought comment on its computer ii computer iii rules  which govern access to incumbent networks by third parties to provide information services 
the proposed rules could  if adopted without adequate assurances for competitive access  limit the ability of new entrants to access and utilize the networks of incumbent local exchange carriers to provide advanced  broadband internet access and could therefore harm z tel s ability to provide services to its customers 
fcc regulation of common carrier services in general  the fcc does not regulate the rates  services  and market entry and exit of non dominant telecommunications carriers  but does require them to contribute to universal service and comply with other regulatory requirements 
we are currently regulated as a non dominant carrier with respect to both our local and long distance telephone services 
as a result  we currently are not subject to rate of return regulation at the federal level and are not currently required to obtain fcc authorization for the installation  acquisition or operation of our domestic exchange or interexchange network facilities 
however  we must comply with the requirements of common carriage under the communications act of we are subject to the general requirement that our charges and terms for our telecommunications services be just and reasonable and that we not make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in our charges or terms 
the fcc has jurisdiction to act upon complaints against any common carrier for failure to comply with its statutory obligations 
we are also subject to fcc rules that limit our ability to discontinue providing certain interstate services  however  the fcc has implemented a process that generally permits a company to discontinue such interstate services on an expedited basis 
comprehensive amendments to the communications act of were made by the telecommunications act of  which was signed into law on february  the telecommunications act effected changes in regulation at both the federal and state levels that affect virtually every segment of the telecommunications industry 
the stated purpose of the telecommunications act is to promote competition in all areas of telecommunications 
interconnection and unbundling requirements 
the telecommunications act greatly expands the interconnection requirements applicable to the incumbent local exchange carriers  ie  generally  those existing local exchange carriers that  in the past  enjoyed virtual or legal monopoly status 
the telecommunications act requires the incumbent local exchange carriers in connection with common carriers to provide physical colocation  which allows companies such as us and other competitive local exchange carriers to install and maintain our own network termination equipment in incumbent local exchange carrier central offices or  if requested or if physical colocation is demonstrated to be technically infeasible  virtual colocation  offer components of their local service networks on an unbundled basis so that other providers of local service can use these elements in their networks to provide a wide range of local services to customers  and establish wholesale rates for their services to promote resale by competitive local exchange carriers 
in addition  all local exchange carriers must interconnect with the facilities of other carriers  establish number portability  which will allow customers to retain their existing phone numbers if they switch from the local exchange carrier to a competitive local service provider  provide nondiscriminatory access to telephone poles  ducts  conduits and rights of way  and 
table of contents compensate other local exchange carriers on a reciprocal basis for traffic originated by one local exchange carrier and terminated by another local exchange carrier 
the fcc is charged with establishing national guidelines to implement certain portions of the telecommunications act 
the fcc s implementation of those provisions of the act has been the subject of ongoing litigation that continues to this day 
the litigation has focused upon two fundamental issues presented by the act the parts of the incumbent telephone networks that companies like z tel can purchase on an unbundled basis  and the price such companies pays for those network elements 
this section provides a history of that litigation and the risks that this ongoing litigation presents to us 
the fcc issued its first interconnection order on august  the fcc addressed both the unbundled access and pricing rules in this proceeding 
in particular  among other decisions  the fcc established a list of seven network elements  comprising most of the significant facilities  features  functionalities  or capabilities of the network that the incumbent local exchange carriers must unbundle 
it is possible for competitors to provide competitive local exchange service using only these unbundled network elements  by means of a combination that later became known as the unbundled network element platform  or une p 
in addition  the fcc mandated a particular forward looking pricing methodology for these network elements that produces relatively low element prices that are favorable to competitors 
incumbent local telephone companies and state commissions appealed the fcc s order to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
in general  the eighth circuit addressed the fcc s pricing rules separately from the network access rules 
on july   the eighth circuit issued a decision vacating the fcc s pricing rules  as well as certain other portions of the fcc s interconnection rules  on the grounds that the fcc had improperly intruded into matters reserved for state jurisdiction 
on january   the supreme court  in at t corp 
v iowa utilities board  largely reversed the eighth circuit s holding that the fcc has general jurisdiction to implement the local competition provisions of the telecommunications act 
in so doing  the supreme court stated that the fcc has authority to set pricing guidelines for unbundled network elements  to prevent incumbent local exchange carriers from physically separating existing combinations of network elements  and to establish pick and choose rules regarding interconnection agreements 
pick and choose rules permit a carrier seeking interconnection to pick and choose among the terms of service from other interconnection agreements between the incumbent local exchange carriers and other competitive local exchange carriers 
this supreme court action reestablished the validity of many of the fcc rules vacated by the eighth circuit 
although the supreme court affirmed the fcc s authority to develop pricing guidelines  the supreme court did not evaluate the specific forward looking pricing methodology mandated by the fcc and remanded the case to the eighth circuit for further consideration 
some incumbent local exchange carriers argued that this pricing methodology does not allow adequate compensation for the provision of unbundled network elements 
the eighth circuit upheld the fcc s use of forward looking incremental costs as the basis for establishing rates for interconnection and unbundled network elements 
the eighth circuit further agreed with the fcc s interpretation of the telecommunications act as rejecting historical costs as the basis for setting rates 
however  the eighth circuit vacated the fcc s regulation  codified at cfr sec 
b  setting forth the fcc s approach to computing forward looking incremental costs  and directed the fcc to review its approach so that it is based on the costs incurred by the incumbent local exchange carrier to provide the actual facilities and equipment that will be used by the requesting carrier instead of the lowest cost based on the most efficient technologies currently available 
in  the united states supreme court granted a writ of certiorari to the eighth circuit decision  and in  the supreme court upheld the fcc s pricing rules 
court consideration of the unbundled access rules followed a parallel track 
in its january  at t corp 
v 
iowa utilities board ruling  the supreme court also remanded the list of unbundled network elements to the fcc for further consideration of the necessity of each one under the telecommunications act s statutory standard for unbundling 
on november   the fcc released an order referred to as the une remand order that retained many of its original list of unbundled network elements  but providing further explanation of the need for such unbundling and eliminated the requirement that incumbent local exchange carriers provide unbundled access to operator services and directory assistance and limiting unbundled access to local switching in certain geographic areas 
with regard to operator services and directory assistance  the fcc concluded that the market has developed since such that competitors can and do self provision these services  or acquire them from alternative sources 
the fcc also noted that incumbent local exchange carriers remain obligated under the non discrimination requirements of the communications act of to comply with the reasonable request of a carrier that purchases these services from the incumbent local exchange carriers to rebrand or unbrand those services  and to provide directory assistance listings and updates in daily electronic batch files 
with regard to unbundled local switching  the fcc concluded that  notwithstanding the incumbent local exchange carriers general duty to provide unbundled local circuit switching  an incumbent local exchange carrier is not required to unbundle local circuit switching for competitors in connection with end users having four or more lines in certain high population density locations within the top metropolitan statistical areas  provided that the incumbent local exchange carrier provides nondiscriminatory access to combinations of unbundled loops and transport also known as enhanced extended links or eels throughout the high density area 
for operator services and directory assistance  as well as for unbundled local switching  the fcc noted that the competitive checklist contained in section of the communications act of requires bell operating companies to provide nondiscriminatory access to these services 
thus  bell operating companies must continue to provide these services to competitors  however  bell operating companies may charge different rates for these offerings 

table of contents the fcc s une remand order was appealed by several parties to the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit  including incumbent local exchange carriers  usta v 
fcc 
in addition  competitive carriers sought reconsideration of that decision  including the fcc s limitation on the availability of unbundled local switching  before the fcc 
while that appeal was pending  the fcc  on december   released a notice of proposed rulemaking in cc dockets no 
 and as part of its comprehensive triennial review of the une remand order 
the fcc proposed to reexamine the availability of all unbundled network elements and to analyze that availability on a more specific basis 
the fcc issued its triennial review order in september while the triennial review proceeding was pending before the fcc  the dc circuit ruled in the usta appeal of the une remand order 
the dc circuit reversed the une remand order on the court s belief that the fcc had not taken into sufficient account the availability of substitutes for unbundled network elements from outside incumbent local telephone networks 
the court called upon the fcc to engage in a detailed granular review as to whether any particular network element should be unbundled  based upon a specific analysis as to whether competitors could obtain comparable elements from other sources or whether a network element possessed natural monopoly characteristics 
in addition  the dc circuit required that the fcc balance the benefits of unbundling for competitors and consumers against the costs that unbundling might impose upon incumbent local telephone companies 
competitors filed for review of the usta decision before the united states supreme court  but the us government and the fcc opposed that review  noting that while the government and fcc believed that the usta decision was inconsistent with the act and the supreme court s verizon decision  the proper course of action would be for the fcc to complete its already pending triennial review rulemaking first 
the supreme court denied the competitors request for an appeal 
in september  the fcc released its final decision in the triennial review proceeding 
in the triennial review order  the fcc also ruled that entrants would no longer be able to access network elements utilized by incumbent local telephone companies to provide broadband services  such as fiber to the premises loops  high capacity ocx transport  packet switching  line sharing for dsl services  and fiber fed next generation digital loop carrier ngdlc loops 
these limitations on unbundled access could have a significant impact upon our business  if incumbent carriers deploy next generation architectures as a replacement for their existing local plant  there is the significant possibility that our ability to provide services to our customers will be eliminated or severely restricted in such situations 
the fcc did reaffirm incumbent local telephone company obligations to provide unbundled access to enhanced extended links eels  a combination of loop and transport and the unbundled network element platform une p combination in particular circumstances  subject to review by state public utility commissions 
in particular  the fcc ruled that entrants like z tel would be able to purchase dedicated transport utilized in eels and analog switching utilized in une p on an unbundled basis  subject to state by state review of whether such unbundling was needed in their states 
carriers were involved in those state by state proceedings when  on march   the dc circuit court of appeals overturned the fcc s decision as an improper delegation of authority to state public utility commissions

march  usta ii 
the dc circuit ordered that the unbundled transport and switching rules be vacated after sixty days or upon denial of a petition for rehearing  whichever occurs later 
a majority of the fcc has indicated that it will support an appeal of this decision 
z tel is weighing its legal options with regard to this opinion  as are other competitive carriers 
if the usta ii decision is not stayed or reversed  it could have immediate  significant  adverse and material impact upon our business 
for example  ilecs might utilize the reversal of the unbundling rules to deny us access to their local networks 
we depend upon such access to provide our services to our customers 
see section of this report entitled risks relating to our financial condition and our business 
we believe that in the event the rules are vacated without any replacement by either the fcc or the state utility commissions  we have interconnection agreements with our principal ilec vendors that will permit us to continue to obtain access to local network elements during any intervening time period 
however  it is possible that any or all of those ilecs will refuse to abide by the terms of those agreements or seek to terminate those agreements 
we are evaluating our legal options to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of our existing and future customers 
other pending matters before the fcc also could impact our business 
in particular  on december   the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in cc docket no 
in which the fcc sought comment on regulatory requirements for incumbent local exchange carrier provision of broadband telecommunications services 
in this proceeding  the fcc is considering whether it should remove regulatory safeguards and common carrier obligations  including unbundling regulations  on incumbent local exchange carrier broadband networks 
an fcc decision limiting unbundling or deregulating incumbent local exchange carrier broadband networks could have a significant and material adverse impact on our business 
for example  incumbent local exchange carriers may be able to offer consumers deregulated broadband network packages of local exchange  information 
table of contents services and broadband service such as dsl that z tel would not be able to offer because z tel would not have unbundled access to that broadband network 
in addition  because the incumbent local exchange carrier broadband network in most instances utilizes the same network facilities as the current incumbent local exchange dial tone network  limitations on unbundling or deregulation of that broadband network could make it difficult  more costly  or even impossible for z tel to provide its current telecommunications and information services to consumers 
these and other fcc determinations are likely to be the subject of further appeals or reconsideration 
thus  while the supreme court has resolved many issues  including aspects of the fcc s jurisdictional authority  other issues remain subject to further consideration by the courts and the fcc 
we cannot predict the ultimate disposition of these matters 
interconnection agreements 
the telecommunications act obligates incumbent local exchange carriers to negotiate with us in good faith to enter into interconnection agreements 
competitive local exchange carriers like us can purchase unbundled network elements under such an agreement or under a tariff or a statement of generally available terms filed with the state regulators 
interconnection agreements are the principal means of obtaining access to the incumbent local exchange carrier s unbundled network elements and providing the connectivity to our network necessary to provision local exchange services  including z linehome 
to this end  we have entered into interconnection agreements with the bell operating company in all states where we currently offer local exchange services 
to ensure that it obtains interconnection and unbundled access at the best available terms  z tel currently is reviewing available contracts or negotiating new contracts in a number of states 
however  at any point in time our interconnection agreement may not contain the best available terms offered to our competitors  a situation that could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
in addition  several of our interconnection agreements with verizon  sbc and bellsouth have expired 
however  the terms of those contracts provide for the agreements to continue on a month to month basis until a replacement is executed 
section of the telecommunications act of contains a specific process for negotiating and arbitrating interconnection agreements with incumbent local telephone companies 
if we cannot reach a voluntary interconnection agreement with an incumbent local exchange carrier on acceptable terms  either side may petition the applicable state commission to arbitrate remaining disagreements 
these arbitration proceedings can last for a substantial period of time and can require substantial resources to litigate 
moreover  state commission approval of any interconnection agreement resulting from negotiation or arbitration is required  and any party may appeal an adverse decision by the state commission to federal district court 
the incentive of the incumbent local exchange carrier to negotiate fair or proper interconnection agreement terms is a function of the willingness and authority of state commissions and the fcc to enforce rules and policies promulgated under the telecommunications act 
the potential cost in resources and delay from this interconnection agreement negotiation and arbitration process could harm our ability to compete in certain markets  and there is no guarantee that a state commission would resolve disputes  including pricing disputes  in our favor 
the ability of a new entrant like z tel to enforce interconnection agreements with incumbent local exchange carriers or appeal state commission arbitrations regarding such agreements is currently subject to considerable legal uncertainty 
a january decision by the united states circuit court for the eleventh circuit ruled that the georgia state commission did not have authority to enforce interconnection agreements between incumbent local exchange carriers and new entrants 
this decision is in apparent conflict with decisions by other united states circuit courts 
as a result of this decision  our costs associated with litigating enforcement of interconnection agreements in state or federal courts in the eleventh circuit and elsewhere could substantially increase 
a november decision by the united states circuit court for the fifth circuit ruled that state commission jurisdiction to arbitrate terms and conditions of access pursuant to section may relate only to items specifically related to section of the act and other items voluntarily negotiated by the parties 
that decision could limit our ability to arbitrate acceptable interconnection terms with incumbent local telephone companies before state commissions  at the same time  that decision could enhance our ability to resist inclusion of clauses in our contracts by those incumbents that we deem unacceptable 
colocation 
the fcc has adopted rules designed to make it easier and less expensive for competitive local exchange carriers to colocate equipment at incumbent local exchange carriers central offices by  among other things  restricting the incumbent local exchange carriers ability to prevent certain types of equipment from being colocated and requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to offer alternative colocation arrangements 
restrictions and impediments to colocation could harm our business as they make it more difficult if not impossible for us to obtain alternatives to unbundled network elements we purchase from incumbent local exchange carriers 
on march   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated portions of the fcc s colocation rules 
specifically  the court found that the fcc s interpretations of the statutory terms necessary and physical colocation were impermissibly broad  and remanded those portions of the order to the fcc for reconsideration 
on august   the fcc released an order on remand in response to this dc circuit decision in cc docket the fcc decided that competitors may colocate equipment in incumbent local exchange carrier central offices if the competitor  as a practical  economic or operational matter would be precluded form obtaining equal in quality interconnection or nondiscriminatory access to unbundled network elements 
the fcc limited which multi functional equipment competitors may colocate 
the fcc also 
table of contents decided that incumbent local exchange carriers must comply with reasonable requests for competitors to install and maintain cross connections with colocated equipment of other competitors 
the fcc also decided that incumbent local exchange carriers may decide where colocated equipment may be placed within its premises as long as the incumbent local exchange carrier acts reasonably and non discriminatorily 
the fcc also determined that except in limited circumstances  an incumbent local exchange carrier may separate the space colocators 
the fcc s new colocation rules could increase the cost and time for competitors to colocate equipment in incumbent local exchange carrier central offices and could have a substantial and material impact on z tel s future business prospects 
this fcc colocation remand order is currently on appeal to the dc circuit 
the outcome of that subsequent appeal is uncertain and could impact z tel s business 
line sharing and line splitting 
on november   the fcc adopted an order requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to provide line sharing  which is a method in which a competitive local exchange carrier offers data services over the same line that a consumer uses for voice services without the competitive local exchange carriers having to provide the voice service 
in an order on reconsideration  issued january   the fcc reaffirmed its prior decision to support line sharing for provision of digital subscriber line dsl services 
in addition  in this january  decision  the fcc stated that incumbent local exchange carriers must permit competitive local exchange carriers to engage in line splitting arrangements  where a competitive local exchange carrier provides voice and another provides data service to end users over a split loop purchased as an unbundled network element from the incumbent local exchange carrier 
while we expect that the fcc s rules will be beneficial to competitive local exchange carriers  we cannot be certain that these rules will be implemented by the incumbent local exchange carrier in a timely or favorable manner 
as a result  z tel s ability to offer its customers dsl service and voice service by use of line splitting and the unbundled network element platform combination is restricted significantly by incumbent local exchange carriers 
that restriction could harm our business and our ability to match the service packages and bundles offered by our competitors 
moreover  in light of the fcc s further notice of proposed rulemaking issued in conjunction with its january  order on reconsideration  several key issues regarding line sharing  including the provision of line sharing in instances where loop facilities have fiber components and where remote terminals do not have sufficient space for colocation  remain 
any decision by the fcc in these proceedings could limit z tel s unbundled access to the incumbent local exchange carrier networks in a manner that could have a substantial and material impact on our current or future business 
bell operating company entry into the long distance market 
the telecommunications act permitted the bell operating companies to provide long distance services outside their local service regions immediately  and permits them to provide in region long distance service upon demonstrating to the fcc that they have adhered to the telecommunication act s section point competitive checklist 
the fcc must also find that granting the application would be in the public interest 
as of this writing  bell companies had received long distance authority in all states within the continental us z tel is currently appealing the fcc s grant of authority to sbc ameritech for illinois  wisconsin  indiana and ohio on the basis that sbc s application and the fcc s approval was predicated upon the availability of une p and the availability of unbundled switching throughout all of those states 
z tel s appeal is pending before the dc circuit and consideration of that appeal is currently being held in abeyance  at z tel s request  pending resolution of the usta ii decision 
now that the dc circuit has ruled in usta ii  we expect that our appeal of the sbc ameritech section authorizations will proceed expeditiously 
z tel believes that because the dc circuit vacated the fcc s unbundled local switching rules in usta ii  the dc circuit should reverse the fcc s grant of long distance authority to sbc ameritech in these states  as the fcc s grant was predicated upon the availability of unbundled local switching to entrants in those states 
with bell operating companies authorized to provide long distance service nationwide  it is generally expected that competition for z tel s local and long distance services will increase 
section entry permits the bell operating company to offer a bundle of local  long distance and enhanced services comparable to z tel s services and therefore could increase competition and harm our business  especially if we cannot obtain adequate access to unbundled network elements from that same bell operating company 
at the same time  the section process also provides an important ongoing incentive for bell operating companies to comply with the unbundling and interconnection requirements of the telecommunications act 
the section competitive checklist specifically requires bell companies to provide competitors access to loop transmission  switching  transport and signaling 
in the triennial review order  the fcc ruled that these section checklist requirements were independent legal obligations with which bell companies must comply  regardless of the status of the unbundling rules under section in the usta ii decision  the dc circuit characterized this independent legal obligation as a reasonable approach 
we will vigorously enforce its rights to access to bell company networks pursuant to the independent legal authority that the section checklist requires 
universal service 
in may  the fcc released an order establishing a significantly expanded universal service regime to subsidize the cost of telecommunications service to high cost areas  as well as to low income customers and qualifying schools  libraries and rural health care providers 
providers of interstate telecommunications services  like us  as well as certain other entities  must pay for these programs 
we are also eligible to receive funding from these programs if we meet certain requirements 

table of contents our share of the payments into these subsidy funds is based on our share of certain defined interstate telecommunications end user revenues 
currently  the fcc is assessing such payments on the basis of a provider s revenue for the previous year 
the fcc adjusts payment requirements and levels periodically 
various states are also in the process of implementing their own universal service programs 
we are currently unable to quantify the amount of subsidy payments that we will be required to make to individual states 
on july   the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit overturned certain of the fcc s rules governing the basis on which the fcc collects subsidy payments from telecommunications carriers and recovery of those payments by incumbent local exchange carriers 
in october  on remand  the fcc issued new universal service rules 
other changes to the universal service program could affect our costs 
the fcc rules are pending review before the fifth circuit 
the outcome of that litigation and subsequent and forthcoming fcc and state determinations could adversely impact or delay our ability to obtain universal service funding for our services or our ability to compete with carriers that do obtain such funding 
the fcc is also seeking comment on how to assess and collect funds from carriers to support the universal service system 
changes to this support program could adversely affect our costs  our ability to separately list these charges on end user bills  and our ability to collect these fees from our customers 
interstate tariffs and rates 
beginning july   interstate domestic long distance companies were no longer allowed to file interstate long distance end user tariffs with the fcc 
this regulatory change requires that z tel make its long distance service information directly available to customers pursuant to private contracts 
in march  the fcc adopted rules that require interexchange long distance carriers like z tel to make specific disclosures on their web sites of their rates  terms and conditions for domestic interstate services 
on april   the fcc limited the ability of nondominant  competitive local exchange carriers  including z tel  to file tariffs for interstate switched access services 
in doing so  the fcc effectively regulates the rates z tel charges long distance companies for interstate switched access services 
local exchange carriers like z tel provide interstate switched access services to interexchange long distance companies like at t  mci and sprint  as well as z tel when a state to state long distance call is made to or placed by a local telephone customer 
given the large number of interstate long distance companies  these interstate switched access services are provided generally through fcc interstate tariffs 
prior to this april  decision  the fcc had refrained from any price regulation of the interstate access rates of competitive local exchange companies like z tel 
with the april  report and order in cc docket no 
 the fcc ruled that it would not accept for filing any interstate switched access tariff filing by a competitive local exchange carrier if the per minute rate exceeded an fcc benchmark 
the fcc benchmark varies by metropolitan statistical area 
in metropolitan statistical areas msas that a competitive local exchange carrier began to provide service after june  the effective date of the order  the fcc benchmark rate is the interstate switched access rate for the competing incumbent local exchange carrier  which is established pursuant to publicly filed tariffs before the fcc 
for msas in which a carrier was providing local service as of june   the fcc benchmark rate from june  through june  was cents per minute or the competing incumbent local exchange carrier rate  whichever is higher 
for those same msas  the fcc benchmark rate from june  through june  was cents per minute or the competing incumbent local exchange carrier rate  whichever is higher 
for those same msas  the fcc benchmark rate from june  through june  is cents per minute or the competing incumbent local exchange carrier rate  whichever is higher 
beginning on june   the fcc benchmark rate for those msas will be the switched access rate of the competing incumbent local exchange carrier 
as of june   z tel was providing local service in most of the msas in its current footprint  as a result  the fcc benchmark rates for z tel s interstate switched access charges in those msas will  through june   be considerably higher than the fcc benchmark rate for z tel s competitors that began to provide service in those msas after june  at t and sprint have appealed the fcc s april clec access charge order before the united states circuit court for the district of columbia  arguing that the fcc s benchmark rates are too high and that competitive local exchange carriers like z tel should be required to provide interstate switched access services at the competing incumbent local exchange carrier rate immediately 
z tel has intervened in that court proceeding against those long distance companies 
two competitive local exchange carriers have also appealed the fcc decision  and several competitive carriers have sought reconsideration or clarification of the fcc s decision 
in addition  z tel has sought a waiver of fcc rules requiring it to tariff interstate switched access services at the competing incumbent local exchange carrier rate for several dozen smaller msas that z tel did not have any local subscribers in as of june   arguing to the fcc that the cost to z tel to provide interstate switched access services at two different rate levels in the same state would impose unnecessary costs on z tel that is inconsistent with the public interest 
these appeals  reconsiderations  and the waiver request are all pending 
the outcome of any of these determinations could have a significant and material impact on z tel s business 
in  z tel settled pending litigation with at t and sprint over their nonpayment of access charges to z tel 
z tel provides interstate and intrastate switched access services to both of those long distance carriers pursuant to switched access service 
table of contents agreements 
based on history of nonpayment of both of these long distance carriers to z tel  there is a risk that either or both of these long distance companies could fail to pay z tel for switched access services 
while z tel has in the past and will in the future adamantly litigate and defend its position against these carriers  nonpayment could have a substantial and material adverse impact on our business 
numbering and number portability 
in august  the fcc issued rules transferring responsibility for administering and assigning local telephone numbers from the bell operating companies and other incumbent local exchange carriers to a neutral entity in each geographic region in the united states 
in august  the fcc issued new numbering regulations that prohibit states from creating new area codes that could unfairly hinder competitive local exchange carriers by requiring their customers to use digit dialing while existing incumbent local exchange carrier customers use seven digit dialing 
in addition  each carrier is required to contribute to the cost of numbering administration through a formula based on net telecommunications revenues 
beginning in march  contributions for this purpose were based on end user telecommunications revenues and have been submitted in association with fcc lifeline  universal service and the schools and libraries funds 
in july  the fcc released rules requiring all local exchange carriers to have the capability to permit both residential and business consumers to retain their telephone numbers when switching from one local service provider to another  known as number portability 
number portability has been implemented in most of the areas in which we provide service  but has not been implemented everywhere in the united states 
some carriers have obtained waivers of the requirement to provide number portability  and others have delayed implementation by obtaining extensions of time before compliance is required 
lack of number portability in a given market could adversely affect our ability to attract customers for our competitive local exchange service offerings  particularly business customers  should we seek to provide services to such customers in those markets 
in  the fcc established number portability rules for wireless carriers that require landline telephone companies to port numbers to customer s wireless services 
wireless number portability has been implemented in most major us metropolitan areas and fcc rules require that it be implemented nationwide 
the fcc has also proposed rules that would require wireless carriers to port numbers to landline carriers like z tel 
if the fcc does not implement congruent porting rules on wireless carriers that are currently applicable to landline carriers  our ability to compete with wireless carriers in providing bundles or packages of wireline and wireless services could be adversely affected 
in may  the fcc also initiated a proceeding to address the problem of the declining availability of area codes and phone numbers 
on december   the fcc issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking in cc dockets no 
and that proposed adoption of a market based approach for optimizing number resources 
in that further notice the fcc seeks input on its tentative conclusion that  through the introduction of charges associated with the allocation of number resources  carriers might be better incentivized to take and retain only as many numbers as they need 
if a market based approach to number allocation is introduced  as the fcc has proposed  it could result in added administrative expenses for us 
restrictions on bundling 
current fcc rules prohibit dominant carriers from bundling their non competitive regulated telecommunications services with their unregulated enhanced or information services 
to our knowledge  the fcc has not enforced this rule with respect to competitive local exchange carriers and has proposed eliminating the rule for all carriers 
slamming 
a customer s choice of local or long distance telecommunications company is encoded in a customer record  which is used to route the customer s calls so that the customer is served and billed by the desired company 
a user may change service providers at any time  but the fcc and some states regulate this process and require that specific procedures be followed 
when these procedures are not followed  particularly if the change is unauthorized or fraudulent  the process is known as slamming 
slamming is such a significant problem that it has been addressed in detail by congress in the telecommunications act  by some state legislatures  and by the fcc in recent orders 
the fcc has levied substantial fines for slamming 
the risk of financial damage  in the form of fines  penalties and legal fees and costs  and to business reputation from slamming is significant 
even one slamming complaint could cause extensive litigation expenses for us 
the fcc recently decided to apply its slamming rules which originally covered only long distance to local service as well 
z tel is also subject to state rules and regulations regarding slamming  cramming  and other consumer protection regulation 
network information 
section of the communications act of and fcc rules protect the privacy of certain information about telecommunications customers that a telecommunications carrier such as us acquires by providing telecommunications services to such customers 
such protected information  known as customer proprietary network information cpni  includes information related to the quantity  technological configuration  type  destination and the amount of use of a telecommunications service 
the fcc s original rules prevented a carrier from using cpni acquired through one of its offerings of a telecommunications service to market certain other services without approval of the affected customer 
the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit overturned a portion of the fcc s rules established in cc docket no 
regarding the use and protection of cpni 
in response to the tenth circuit decision  in october  in cc docket no 
 the fcc clarified that the tenth circuit reversal was limited and that most of the fcc s cpni rules remained in effect 
the fcc sought further comment on what method of customer consent offered by a carrier either an opt in or opt out approach would serve the governmental interest in section and be consistent with the first amendment 
the final determination of this issue and other fcc rules regarding 
table of contents handling of cpni could result in significant administrative expense to z tel in modifying internal customer systems to meet these requirements 
intercarrier compensation interstate access charges and reciprocal compensation 
because z tel  as a competitive local exchange carrier  passes and receives local and toll calls to and from other local exchange carriers and long distance companies  the rates for intercarrier compensation for these calls has a significant and substantial impact on the profitability of our business 
in addition  the rates that our competitors  especially the incumbent local exchange carriers  are permitted to charge end users  other local exchange carriers  and long distance companies for originating  transmitting  and terminating telecommunications traffic can have a substantial impact on our ability to offer services in competition with those carriers 
the current regulatory and intercarrier compensation status of dial up calls to internet service providers is in dispute and litigation 
the fcc has determined that both continuous access and dial up calls from a customer to an internet service provider are interstate  not local  calls  and  therefore  are subject to the fcc s jurisdiction 
the fcc has initiated a proceeding to determine the effect that this regulatory classification will have on the obligation of local exchange carriers to pay reciprocal compensation for dial up calls to internet service providers that originate on one local exchange carrier network and terminate on another local exchange carrier network 
moreover  many states have or are considering this issue  and several states have held that local exchange carriers do not need to pay reciprocal compensation for calls terminating at internet service providers 
a majority of state commissions have ruled that reciprocal compensation should be paid on such traffic 
on march   the court of appeals for the district of columbia remanded for reconsideration the fcc s determination that calls to internet service providers are interstate for jurisdictional purposes rather than local 
specifically  the court indicated that the fcc has not provided a satisfactory explanation why calls to internet service providers are not local telecommunications traffic and why such traffic is exchange access rather than telephone exchange service 
we cannot predict the effect that the fcc s resolution of these issues will have on our business 
since passage of the telecommunications act of  the fcc has fundamentally restructured the access charges that incumbent local exchange carriers charge to interexchange carriers and end user customers to connect to the incumbent local exchange carrier s network 
the fcc revised access charges for the largest incumbent local exchange carriers in may  reducing per minute access charges and increasing flat rated monthly charges paid by both long distance carriers and end users 
further changes in access charges were effected for the largest incumbent local exchange carriers when the fcc adopted the coalition for affordable local and long distance service calls proposal in may calls  which reflected a negotiated settlement between at t and most of the bell operating companies  reduced per minute charges by percent 
it further increased flat rated monthly charges to end users  in particular  multi line business users 
the calls plan also attempted to remove implicit universal service subsidies paid for by long distance companies in interstate access rates and place those funds into the federal universal service support system  where they would be recovered from all interstate carriers 
most of the reductions in the calls plan resulted from shifting access costs away from interexchange carriers onto end user customers 
last year  the fifth circuit reversed and remanded portions of the calls plan back to the fcc for further consideration of the issue as to the size of the subsidy for universal service should be removed from the interstate access charges and placed into the federal interstate universal service support system 
the outcome of this litigation could impact the contributions z tel  as an interstate carrier  must pay to support the federal universal service support system 
in addition  as discussed above  the rates that z tel and other competitive local exchange carriers may charge for interstate switched access services are regulated pursuant to the fcc s april clec access charge order 
in april  the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking in cc docket no 
in which it proposed a fundamental re examination of all currently regulated forms of intercarrier compensation 
the fcc proposed that carriers transport and terminate local traffic on a bill and keep basis  rather than per minute reciprocal compensation charges 
the fcc regards the calls order and the clec access charge order as well as its reciprocal compensation rules to be year transitional intercarrier compensation regimes 
after completion of that three year transition  a new interstate intercarrier compensation regime based upon bill and keep or another alternative may be in place 
because z tel both makes payments to and receives payments from other carriers for exchange of local and long distance calls  at this time we cannot predict the effect that the fcc s determination in cc docket no 
may have upon our business 
potential legislation 
changes to the market opening and enforcement provisions of the communications act of or the telecommunications act of could adversely affect our ability to provide competitive services and could harm our business 
no substantial re write of either act has been introduced before the us congress as of this writing 
other issues 
there are a number of other issues and proceedings that could have an effect on our business in the future  including the following facts 
the fcc has adopted rules to require telecommunications service providers to make their services accessible to individuals with disabilities  if readily achievable 
in march   the department of justice filed a rulemaking petition before the fcc that asks for new rules to 
table of contents implement the communications assistance with law enforcement act calea 
calea requires telecommunications providers to design and engineer their networks to permit law enforcement agencies to wiretap and obtain customer service information eg  call trace  call records 
the department of justice calea petition proposes to extend many of those requirements to information services as well 
implementation of the proposed calea rules could have a significant impact upon our ability to provide both regulated common carrier and information services to our customers 
such rules could increase the cost of equipment we purchase to deploy our services and such rules could also delay the availability of equipment we need 
we cannot predict any such delays or the potential cost at this time 
current fcc rules require telecommunications service providers to provide law enforcement personnel with a sufficient number of ports and technical assistance in connection with wiretaps 
we cannot predict the cost to us of complying with these rules at this time 
the fcc has adopted new rules designed to make it easier for customers to understand the bills of telecommunications carriers 
these truth in billing rules establish certain requirements regarding the formatting of bills and the information that must be included on bills 
we are subject to annual regulatory fees assessed by the fcc  and must file an annual employment report to comply with the fcc s equal employment opportunity policies 
the fcc has adopted an order granting limited pricing flexibility to large incumbent local exchange carriers  and is considering granting additional pricing flexibility and price deregulation options 
these actions could increase competition for some of our services 
the foregoing is not an exhaustive list of proceedings or issues that could materially affect our business 
we cannot predict the outcome of these or any other proceedings before the courts  the fcc  legislative bodies  or state or local governments 
state regulation to the extent that we provide telecommunications services that originate and terminate within the same state  we are subject to the jurisdiction of that state s public service commission 
as our local service business and product lines expand  we will offer more intrastate services and may become increasingly subject to state regulation 
the telecommunications act maintains the authority of individual state utility commissions to preside over rate and other proceedings  and to impose their own regulation on local exchange and intrastate interexchange services  so long as such regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of federal law 
for instance  states may require us to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity before commencing service in the state 
we have obtained such authority in all states in which we operate  and  as a prelude to market entry in additional states  we have obtained such authority to provide local service in states and the district of columbia 
in addition to requiring certification  state regulatory authorities may impose tariff and filing requirements  consumer protection measures  and obligations to contribute to universal service and other funds 
state commissions also have jurisdiction to approve negotiated rates  or establish rates through arbitration  for interconnection  including rates for unbundled network elements 
changes in those rates for unbundled network elements could have a substantial and material impact on our business 
we are subject to requirements in some states to obtain prior approval for  or notify the state commission of  any transfers of control  sales of assets  corporate reorganizations  issuance of stock or debt instruments and related transactions 
although we believe such authorizations could be obtained in due course  there can be no assurance that state commissions would grant us authority to complete any of these transactions 
we are also subject to state laws and regulations regarding slamming  cramming  and other consumer protection and disclosure regulations 
these rules could substantially increase the cost of doing business in any one particular state 
state commissions have issued or proposed several substantial fines against competitive local exchange companies for slamming or cramming 
the risk of financial damage  in the form of fines  penalties and legal fees and costs  and to business reputation from slamming is significant 
even one slamming complaint before a state commission could cause extensive litigation expenses for us 
in addition  state law enforcement authorities may utilize their powers under state consumer protection laws against us in the event legal requirements in that state are not met 
z tel s rates for intrastate switched access services  which z tel provides to long distance companies to originate and terminate in state toll calls  are subject to the jurisdiction of the state commissions in which the call originated and terminated 
state commissions may  like texas  directly regulate or prescribe this intrastate switched access rate 
such regulation by other states could materially and adversely affect z tel s revenues and business opportunities within that state 
the telecommunications act generally preempts state statutes and regulations that restrict the provision of competitive services 
as a result of this preemption  we will be generally free to provide the full range of local  long distance  and data services in any state 
while this action greatly increases our potential for growth  it also increases the amount of competition to which we may be subject 
states  however  may still restrict z tel s ability to provide competitive services in some rural areas 
in addition  the cost 
table of contents of enforcing federal preemption against certain state policies and programs may be large and may cause considerable delay 
as we roll out new services on a state by state basis  we anticipate that the incumbent local exchange carrier will provide the unbundled network element platform components in a manner similar to that provided in states where we currently operate 
however  pricing and terms and conditions adopted by the incumbent local exchange carrier in each of these states may preclude our ability to offer a competitively viable and profitable product within these and other states on a going forward basis 
in order to enter new markets  we may be required to negotiate interconnection agreements with incumbent local exchange carriers on an individual state basis 
to continue to provide service  we also need to renegotiate interconnection agreements with incumbent local exchange carriers 
while current fcc rules and regulations require the incumbent provider to provide the network elements on an individual and combined basis necessary for us to provision end user services  no assurance can be made that the individual local exchange providers will provide these components in a manner and at a price that will support competitive operations 
if the incumbent providers do not readily provide network functionality in the manner required  we have regulatory and legal alternatives  including arbitration before state public service commissions  to force provision of services in a manner required to support our service offerings 
however  if we are forced to litigate in order to obtain the combinations of network elements required to support our service  we are likely to incur significant incremental costs and delays in entering such markets 
in addition  as discussed above  there is considerable legal uncertainty as to how interconnection agreements are to be enforced before state commissions and where appeals of state commission interconnection agreement determinations may be heard 
state legislatures also may impact our business 
in  the illinois general assembly passed a law that ordered the illinois commerce commission to increase unbundled network elements rates 
z tel and several other competitive carriers filed a lawsuit and injunction against that law  on the basis that the telecommunications act of ordered state commissions not state legislatures to establish rates for network elements 
the us district court for the northern district of illinois and  subsequently  the united states circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit  agreed and ordered a permanent injunction against the illinois statute 
nevertheless  incumbent local telephone companies actively lobby and support legislation that would curtail the roles of state public utility commissions  limit competitive access laws that may exist at the state level that may go beyond the telecommunications act  or otherwise limit the ability of competitive companies like z tel to compete against incumbents or obtain access to local networks at just  reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates 
at any point in time  several such bills are pending before the state legislatures of states in which we do business  and passage of such legislation could have a significant and material effect on our ability to do business in that particular state 
local government regulation in some of the areas where we provide service  we may be subject to municipal franchise requirements requiring us to pay license or franchise fees either on a percentage of gross revenue  flat fee or other basis 
we may be required to obtain street opening and construction permits from municipal authorities to install our facilities in some cities 
the telecommunications act prohibits municipalities from discriminating among telecommunications service providers in imposing fees or franchise requirements 
in some localities  the fcc has preempted fees and other requirements determined to be discriminatory or to effectively preclude entry by competitors  but such proceedings have been lengthy and the outcome of any request for fcc preemption would be uncertain 
competition overview the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
however  at present  we believe few telecommunications carriers provide the type of bundled service packages that include the range of services and features that we offer  but various competitors offer one or more of the services that make up our service offerings 
competition in the local telephone services market arises primarily from the ilecs and alternative transport systems such as wireless  cable and the internet 
competition in the long distance and information services markets  which have fewer entry barriers  is already intense and is expected to remain so 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business will be the quality and reliability of our services  customer confidence  innovation  customer service and price 
our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our continued ability to offer innovative  high quality  market driven services at prices generally equal to or below those charged by our competitors and to instill confidence in prospective customers as to our long term viability and the viability of our access to ilec and other networks 
many of our current and potential competitors have far greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do  as well as other competitive advantages 
local telephone service incumbent local exchange carriers 
in each of our target markets  we will compete with the incumbent local exchange carrier serving that area  which may be one of the bell operating companies 
the incumbent local exchange carriers have long standing relationships with their customers  have financial  technical and marketing resources substantially greater than ours  have the potential to subsidize services that compete with our services with revenue from a variety of other unregulated businesses  and currently benefit from certain existing regulations that favor the incumbent local exchange carriers over us in certain respects 

table of contents also as stated above under government regulation  a recent court ruling has created uncertainty in the ilecs and our regulatory environment 
this uncertainty favors the ilecs and may enable them to raise fees they charge to us  thereby causing us to raise our rates to non competitive levels 
regulations that allow competitive local exchange carriers  such as us  to interconnect with incumbent local exchange carrier facilities and acquire and combine the unbundled network elements of an incumbent local exchange carrier provide increased business opportunities for us 
however  such interconnection opportunities have been  and will likely continue to be  accompanied by increased pricing flexibility and relaxation of regulatory oversight for the incumbent local exchange carriers 
competitive local exchange carriers 
we face competition in local telephone services from numerous competitive local exchange carriers  including our own wholesale customer sprint 
interexchange long distance carriers such as at t  mci and sprint have entered the local telephone market 
these companies have name recognition  standing relationships with their customers and financial  technical and marketing resources substantially greater than we have 
the telecommunications act radically altered the market opportunity for competitive local exchange carriers 
with the required unbundling of the incumbent local exchange carrier s networks  competitive local exchange carriers are able to enter the market more rapidly by leasing switches  trunks and loop capacity until traffic volume justifies building substantial facilities 
newer competitive local exchange carriers  like us  will not have to replicate existing facilities and can be more opportunistic in designing and implementing networks  which could have the effect of increasing competition for local exchange services 
cable television operators 
cable television operators are also entering the telecommunications market by upgrading their networks with fiber optics and installing facilities to provide fully interactive transmission of broadband voice  video and data communications 
these companies have standing relationships with their customers and generally have financial  technical and marketing resources substantially greater than we have 
wireless telephone companies 
wireless telephone systems are seen by many consumers as a substitute for traditional wireline local telephone service 
wireless companies have name recognition  standing relationships with their customers and financial  technical and marketing resources substantially greater than we have 
voip providers 
the internet is being used by a limited number of consumers as a substitute for traditional wireline local and long distance telephone service 
the number of voip users could expand rapidly in the near future 
we intend to offer our own voip services 
other entrants into this market may include ilecs  cable television operators and internet service providers as well as new entrants 
new entrants 
we could face competition from new entrants into the local exchange market 
because the telecommunications act requires the unbundling of the incumbent local exchange carrier s networks  new entrants are able to enter the market by leasing switches  trunks and loop capacity in lieu of expending funds building substantial facilities 
this lower barrier to entry could have the effect of increasing competition for local exchange services 
moreover  a continuing trend toward consolidation of telecommunications companies and the formation of strategic alliances within the telecommunications industry  as well as the development of new technologies  could give rise to significant new competitors 
long distance telephone service the long distance telecommunications industry has numerous entities competing for the same customers and a high average churn rate because customers frequently change long distance providers in response to the offering of lower rates or promotional incentives by competitors 
our primary competitors in the long distance market include major interexchange carriers such as at t  mci and sprint  certain incumbent local exchange carriers and resellers of long distance services 
we believe that pricing levels are a principal competitive factor in providing long distance telephone service 
we hope to avoid direct price competition by bundling long distance telephone service with a wide array of value added  enhanced communications services 
we believe that incumbent local exchange carriers that offer a package of local  long distance telephone and information services will be particularly strong competitors 
incumbent local exchange carriers  including verizon  bellsouth  qwest and sbc communications  are currently providing both long distance and local services as well as certain enhanced telephone services that we offer 
we believe that the bell operating companies will attempt to offset market share losses in their local markets by attempting to capture a significant percentage of the long distance market 
enhanced communications services we compete with a variety of enhanced service companies 
enhanced communications services markets are highly competitive  and we expect that competition will continue to intensify 
our competitors in these markets include internet service providers  web based communications service providers and other telecommunications companies  including the major interexchange carriers  incumbent local exchange carriers  competitive local exchange carriers and wireless carriers 

table of contents wholesale services we believe we are the sole competitive local exchange carrier offering local exchange services on a wholesale basis 
our chief competitor on the wholesale level in each territory is the incumbent local exchange carrier  usually a bell operating company 
our competitive advantage is our knowledge and experience in dealing with incumbent local exchange carriers  our knowledge and experience in offering local services  our proprietary enhanced features and our operational support systems 
bell operating companies  in general  do not promote and market their ability to offer wholesale services  preferring to minimize competition in the local telephone services market 
we offer our wholesale customers a full suite of services for their use in providing telephone services to their customers 
we face competition from a variety of companies that offer particular services such as provisioning services  billing services and enhanced communications services such as voicemail or that offer technologies related to such services

table of contents item selected consolidated financial data history of operations we were founded in january of in our first year of operations  we focused primarily on research and development activities  recruiting personnel  purchasing operating assets  and developing our service offerings and marketing plans 
in the fourth quarter of we launched our first service offering composed of an access card to make long distance calls from any phone coupled with enhanced services  such as voice mail  find me call forwarding  and community messaging 
in our revenues totaled million 
during june of we launched our primary service offering z line home edition currently called z linehome in new york 
this is our bundled telecommunications service providing integrated local  long distance and enhanced services targeted at residential customers 
our revenues for increased to million 
on december   we filed our initial public offering of million shares 
this offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
this offering provided us with the opportunity  at the potential expense of profitability  to accelerate our investments in the building of our network  the continuation of our research and development  the acceleration of sales and marketing activities  and the development of our administrative infrastructure 
we purchased touch communications  inc touch in april in an effort to facilitate our planned growth 
these investments lead to our revenues growing to million in nevertheless  these investments also significantly increased our operating and cash expenditures 
this growth was slowed during as we moved our focus from growth to profitability 
we focused on lowering customer acquisition costs  improving operating efficiencies  and attracting and maintaining a higher quality customer  which initiatives resulted in a charge of million relating to the write off of certain accounts receivables and a million impairment of assets relating to the sale of certain assets  primarily telemarketing centers 
we also experienced a reduction in overall headcount in through a workforce reduction  attrition and the sale of the majority of the operations and assets of the telemarketing centers that we acquired in in  we had revenues of million and incurred a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million in we continued our focus on operating improvement and cash management during we also decided to diversify our services and revenues streams by offering wholesale services to other telephone companies 
we signed a contract with mci worldcom communications  inc mci at the end of the first quarter of we recorded million of revenues and net loss of million during our wholesale services represented of total reported revenues for the year ended december  although the results of appear to be very similar to those reported for  there were several significant changes that occurred during we signed an agreement with sprint communications  lp sprint in february of this agreement provided us with a wholesale customer that has grown to nearly  lines in the first months of our relationship 
this agreement provided significant positive cash and operating results and eliminated the impact of the mci wholesale agreement that was terminated in october of the mci wholesale contract was an agreement that essentially from its outset had a large amount of uncertainty due to mci s bankruptcy proceedings 
we also invested in a large amount of sales and marketing during the first half of to help increase our retail lines 
after looking at the results of these efforts and the increased competition and pricing pressure that has continued to occur in the residential telephone market we decided to shift our growth initiatives to our business and wholesale services during the second half of we still anticipate that residential service will account for the largest portion of our overall revenue steam and our operating cash flow in we spent the second half of building our business services  and we expect to see significant growth in this offering during we expect wholesale services to consistently grow during the year 
any new agreements within this line of business would provide additional opportunities for growth 
we are also planning to launch our voice over internet protocal voip services sometime during the second quarter of our new voip offerings may provide additional revenues  but will not likely contribute meaningfully to positive operations or be of a significant nature until at least the following selected historical consolidated financial data has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information contained in this document

this cash was obtained through the sale of  shares including the underwriters over allotment option of our common stock at per share 

table of contents we recorded a and million expense related to impaired assets in and  respectively 
this expense was the result of management s decision to reduce various customer growth initiatives  most notably telemarketing activity levels 
in  a majority of the operations and assets of telemarketing centers acquired from touch was either voluntarily closed or sold 
in addition to the goodwill impairment of million  we recorded a million charge associated with the impairment of assets  composed of million relating to unrealizable software and development projects  million of a worthless telemarketing property and equipment  and million of securities deemed to be worthless 
as a result of management s decision in the second quarter of to enhance future cash flow and operating earnings  we closed the remaining call centers in north dakota and recorded a million asset impairment 
we also incurred restructuring charges as a result of this decision during as discussed in item 
included in the general and administrative expense was a write off of accounts receivable that resulted in million of additional bad debt expense 
during  we issued series d and e preferred stock for approximately and million  respectively 
during we issued series g preferred stock for approximately million

we recorded start up costs for developing this new service offering of approximately million 
all wholesale related costs after our initial wholesale services contract signed on march  are included in the operating expenses line items  rather than being segregated 
during  we closed two call centers in north dakota and our new york sales office 
as discussed in item above  these expenses consisted primarily of termination benefits  lease abandonment and lease settlement costs

for management purposes  we are organized into two reportable operating segments retail services and wholesale services 
the nature of our business is rapidly evolving  and we have a limited operating history 

table of contents economic and industry wide factors the overall telecommunication industry is experiencing an enormous amount of competition 
although telecommunications has always been relatively competitive  it seems that competitive pressures are even further intensifying  as incumbent and new providers continue to undercut each other in price while offering more and new services 
in order to promote new services  providers usually provide immediate discounts and enticements 
this generally makes prospective customers more willing perhaps to switch telecommunication providers and experiment with new service offerings 
the industry is also receiving entrants from other industries  which is creating various bundling and pricing opportunities 
not only are end user prices generally decreasing  but customers are also receiving more minutes  features  options  and partnering advantages than has been typically available in the past 
the industry is also experiencing increased churn as service providers in the wireline  wireless  voip  cable  internet  satellite  and other markets compete for and in some cases target each other s customer bases with various marketing and partnering opportunities 
the overlapping of markets is also driving the desire of companies to be the sole provider of services across many communication markets  which provides additional margins and an incentive to customers to stay with the provider as a result of discounts for receiving multiple services 
the telecommunications act and the establishment of the unbundled network element platform unep and total element long run incremental cost telric pricing have been consumed in either regulatory uncertainty or in the court system as the ilec s continue to argue for the elimination of une p or at a very minimum the need to increase pricing of une p 
this consistent status of flux and uncertainty has become more significant recently 
the uncertainty is a result of the dc circuit decision that vacates certain federal communication commission fcc rules related to une p days from march   or upon denial of a petition for rehearing  whichever is later  primarily as a result of what  in the court s opinion  is the mishandling of the telecommunications act by the fcc 
therefore  the competitive carriers have appealed to the us supreme court to review the case 
this uncertainty could make it extremely difficult to operate our business as we must work even more diligently to convince the market  customers  partners  vendors  lenders and other constituents that this issue will pass and we will be able to continue to successfully pursue our business plan 
we believe that une p will continue to exist into the foreseeable future  but we do not know the exact time frame 
we will also continue to pursue our voip initiatives  as this is our planned longer term solution to mitigating or perhaps fully eliminating our risk from the uncertainty of une p 
we believe that there are significant opportunities to grow our business  especially through marketing partnerships 
we believe that the establishment of bundled service offerings as being the standard will further drive the convergence of services across all telecommunication service offerings and even across markets 
we believe that this will only increase as customers increasingly recognize the value of bundled services 
we expect further partnering and potential consolidation in the telecommunications industry during the coming years as competition continues  the regulatory environment becomes clearer and the availability of service offerings expands 
there is also significant risk with these factors as the intense competition from a price and service perspective will force continued operational and financial pressures on operating margins and perhaps other measurements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  disputed payables related to network operations expense  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived and intangible assets  restructuring reserves  tax related accruals and contingencies 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
furthermore  accounting treatment of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses may differ from telecommunication regulatory treatment of these same items 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when earned 
revenues related to long distance  carrier access service and certain other usage driven charges are billed monthly in arrears and the associated revenues are recognized during the month of service 
we record an estimate for this amount 
subscription services are billed monthly in advance and we recognize revenues for this service ratably over the service period 
we defer certain installation charges and recognize this revenue ratably over the estimated life of our customer 
our wholesale services revenues are derived from contractual arrangements 
we perform a review of each contract and determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual item within the contract 
we are currently deferring certain revenues over the life of our arrangements  rather than recognizing these revenues up front 
in instances where we are the primary obligor for costs incurred we use the gross method to record our 
table of contents revenues for wholesale services 
we operate in a heavily regulated industry  therefore  our pricing is subject to both state and federal regulatory commission oversight 
such oversight could result in changes to the amount we bill our customers in current and future periods 
the gross accounting presentation for our wholesale services business segment requires the understanding that certain recorded revenues are actually direct cost pass through 
for instance  under our sprint contract we charge to sprint  with a zero mark up  certain charges that we receive from the incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs that are attributable to lines that are owned by sprint under the aforementioned agreement 
however  late in the third quarter of sprint established its own billing codes with the ilecs and has been adding all new customers to these codes 
this had the effect of reducing our gross monthly billings to sprint  yet has no impact on the profitability of the contract 
indeed  sprint s lines under the wholesale services agreement were actually increasing significantly during the period in reference 
this action also has the impact of increasing total margins  even though the profitability of the contract on a per line basis was unchanged 
this is why we chose to focus on the net income per wholesale services line in service  as opposed to stated revenues or margins per se 
disputed payables related to network operations and general and administrative expense 
network operations expenses are primarily charges from the ilecs for the leasing of their lines  utilizing the une p  made available to us as a result of the telecommunication act of  and long distance and other charges from inter exchange carriers ixcs 
we record certain charges such as up front set up fees  incorrect dispatch  and change and modification charges in the general and administrative expense line item 
we typically have disputed billings with ixcs and ilecs as a matter of normal business operations 
certain of these disputed amounts are recorded as an expense at the time of dispute  but we do not pay any of our disputes until they are resolved and it is determined that we indeed owe part or all of the dispute 
our disputes are for various reasons including but not limited to incorrect billing rates  alternatively billed services  duplicate billing errors  and costs associated with line loss 
this pricing is subject to both state and federal oversight and therefore  our pricing is subject to change 
any such change could have a material impact on our business 
management recognizes as disputes any billing that is continued to be presented as a past due amount on invoices that we receive 
this approach results in the disclosure of certain disputes that management does not believe are of a significant risk to us  primarily due to the age and or the dispute  but believe it is appropriate to disclose the amounts as they have not been resolved and continue to be billed to us as past due amounts 
valuation of accounts receivable 
considerable judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of our customers 
we regularly analyze our approach as we gain additional experience or new events and information are identified to determine if any change to our methodology is warranted 
our current allowance methodology is directly related to the age of a customer s receivable and the belief that the older the receivable is  the less likely a customer is to pay 
additionally  we have performed liquidation and other collection analyses to make necessary changes in reporting our accounts receivable in a reasonable and prudent fashion 
the impact of changing the percentages we use for each aging bucket in the calculation of our allowance for doubtful accounts by would result in a million change to our bad debt expense 
property  plant and equipment 
changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
we utilize straight line depreciation for property and equipment 
we perform an annual analysis to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of current property  plant and equipment 
estimates and assumptions are used in both setting depreciable lives for various asset classes and in testing for recoverability 
these estimates and assumptions require considerable judgment 
the effect of a one year change in the useful lives of our switching and computer equipment  software and software development would result in a change of million to our depreciation expense 
tax related accruals 
our estimates of deferred and current income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in footnote income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
these reflect our assessment of actual current and future estimated income taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of actual realization 
currently we have placed a valuation allowance on all net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is required if the weight of evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we also are subject to various tax audits from various federal  state  and local jurisdictions and make estimates based on available information and after consultation with experts  where necessary 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable based on facts known now  however  they may change materially in the future due to new developments 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments in each matter

we use this measure when analyzing our retail services businesses  but not when assessing our wholesale services business for reasons discussed earlier in this section under the critical accounting policies and estimates within the revenue recognition section 
the following table provides a detail of our arpu average revenue per unit in service for the years ending amount percentage december  change favorable change favorable type of revenues unfavorable unfavorable bundled residential services bundled business services n a long distance services not meaningful the overall change in our revenues in compared to the prior year was driven by our focus on growing our wholesale and business services during the last half of residential services revenues grew during the first half of but with our shift in focus mid year we ended nearly flat compared to the prior year 
we expect the trend of focusing on growing our bundled business and wholesale services while the signing of a partnering agreement has the potential to increase our bundled residential services in we also expect that our arpu will stay relatively flat to slightly lower into the foreseeable future  primarily due to the competitive climate and due to reductions in access 
table of contents fees 
to the extent that we are able to develop more and or new service offerings  such as our pva and or digital subscriber line dsl  we may have some opportunity to mitigate any decrease in general levels of arpu 
we expect residential  business and wholesale lines in service to grow significantly during we believe that the economics of our business and wholesale services are currently more attractive for active investment than is the traditional residential business 
therefore  we will invest in sales and marketing activities to attract business customers and look to marketing partnership opportunities to be the primary driver in our residential revenues 
in march  we entered into a marketing partnership with a large communication company 
this new offering is expected to be launched in may we expect to launch our voice over internet protocol voip services in the second quarter of  but we do not expect a significant amount of revenue from this new service offering during we continue to target companies with large existing residential and business customer bases for various forms of partnership opportunities  and we are also exploring additional distribution and delivery opportunities for our services 
we are also seeking additional wholesale services relationships 
network operations 
network operations expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our network operations expense primarily consists of fixed and variable transmission expenses for the leasing of the une p components from the ilecs  domestic and international charges from service level agreements with ixcs  and the usf and certain other regulatory charges to be consistent with industry practice 
the increase in network operation expense was primarily the result of having an overall larger average number of lines under management in service for the year ended compared to the prior year 
the following table provides a detailed break down and analysis of changes in network operations expense network operations for the years ending amount percentage percentage of december  change favorable change favorable network operations unfavorable unfavorable in millions bundled residential business services long distance services wholesale services total our network operations expense as a percentage of revenues  increased to for compared to in the prior year 
we recorded a reduction to network operations expense for certain retroactive rate reductions and billing errors in the amounts of million and million recorded in and  respectively 
excluding the impact of these retroactive rate reductions  the consolidated network costs  as a percentage of revenues were for compared to in the prior year 
the increase in network operations is primarily a result of the impact of the gross accounting used to account for our wholesale service 
the following table provides a detail of network operations expense as a percentage of revenues by the respective revenue types 
this table excludes an analysis of wholesale services because management does not look at this measure  given that network expenses related to wholesale services are intended to be zero margin direct cost pass through in nature 
network operations as a of revenues for the amount years ended december  change favorable unfavorable bundled residential business services long distance services we also analyze the average expense per unit aepu for network operations  similar to the arpu calculation for revenues 
aepu is calculated by taking total network operations expense divided by to calculate the average network operations expense per month and this total is divided by the average lines in service 
the following details aepu for network operations expense 

table of contents average network operations expense per unit for the years ended amount percentage december  change favorable change favorable type of revenues unfavorable unfavorable bundled residential business services long distance services excluding the million and million retroactive rate reductions for and  respectively  the bundled residential and business services network operations expense as a percentage of revenue would have been for the year ended december  compared to in the prior year 
performing this same analysis for the bundled residential business services would have resulted in aepu increasing by to in  compared to in the prior year 
the overall increase in network operations expense was primarily driven by our increase in wholesale lines in service from our contract with sprint 
the increase of approximately  lines in the average bundled residential and business service lines also contributed to the increased expense 
our long distance services provided a small off set to these services 
in addition to an increase in the overall average lines in service  we also experienced a small increase in the aepu which also contributed to our increase in network operations expense 
this increase was primarily the net result of three contributing factors increased usage as a result of our customer choosing our unlimited product which generally results in increased domestic long distance charges  increased per line costs as our customer base continues to become more geographically diverse resulting in some small changes to the average cost experienced as a result of having more lines in more expensively priced une p states and zones  reduced by our auditing and analysis of network operations and improving the synchronization of our billing systems to help reduce network costs on a per unit basis 
we expect network operations expense to increase in as we plan for an increase in the overall lines in service 
we also expect continued increases to our aepu as a result of increased usage  continued geographical dispersion of customers to more expensive une p pricing zones and states  increased proportion of business lines which have a higher network operations expense per unit and possible increased costs due to the risk in the regulatory arena relative to the costs of leasing the une p elements 
we will be focusing our efforts on insuring that the pricing and availability of une p is conducive to our desire to compete  however  we recognize the wide range of possibilities that could occur  including the possibility of an immediate and material adverse effect upon our business 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the sales and marketing expense primarily consists of telemarketing  direct mail  brand awareness advertising and independent sales representative commissions and salaries and benefits paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities 
the increase in sales and marketing expense is directly attributable to increased payments of one time and recurring commissions to independent sales contractors  which increased by million in compared to the prior year 
this increase was partially off set by expenses associated with our telemarketing centers that were closed in but resulted in million of expenses being recorded prior to their closure 
the remaining increase was in general advertising activities 
we continue to treat our sales and marketing expense as a discretionary spending item in the management of our cash flow 
we significantly decreased sales and marketing activity levels during by closing our telemarketing centers and focusing on conserving cash 
during the first half of  we increased our sales and marketing efforts to attract residential lines 
as a result of intense competition and the economics of a residential customer relative to a business customer  we elected to shift our primary focus of time and monetary resources to the marketing of our newly introduced business services 
this was achieved primarily through the addition of an in house sales team 
we have also recruited master independent sale contractors to assist with growing this line of business 
this focus has provided us with the ability to leverage our national footprint by offering prospective end users a consolidating billing solution and by providing local and long distance services to multi location businesses 
this is also intended to further diversify our service offerings  revenue streams and cash flow streams beyond only retail residential services and wholesale services 
our business service has provided lower acquisition cost on a per line basis in some cases  depending on the type of account acquired 
fundamentally however  we believe that the limited amount of sales and marketing dollars and resources that we have had and currently have access to are best spent by being focused on acquiring business customers due to lower churn rates  extended customer lives and lower ongoing services costs  including but not limited to reduced rates of bad debt 
we will continue to invest in our residential base but in smaller amounts than we have historically  however  our decision to enter certain partnering opportunities may result in increased sales and marketing expense 
we continue our use of the pva as a component of our sales strategy 
we believe that pva is a service differentiator for our residential and business service offerings 
we continue to expand our traditional retail sales approach of offering our services in retail 
table of contents electronics and recently wireless stores in an effort to provide them with the ability to offer a complete wireless and wireline service for customers 
we believe that this approach may allow us to reduce our total acquisition costs by creating opportunities to partner with organizations that can provide us with attractive distribution economics 
additionally  we have introduced new bundles and pricing points in an effort to expand the marketability of our offerings to consumers including variations of pva on a stand alone basis 
we also expect to launch our voip initiative during the second quarter of  and have already hired a sales force to begin supporting the sale of this new service on a pre sale basis 
we will continue to build the overall awareness of our z brand and explore alliances and ventures with other companies 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase significantly during as a result of a new agreement that we have signed with a large communications provider  which likely will increase commission payments  however  we are still assessing the final accounting for this contract and its accounting impact on our future results 
we will continue to manage sales and marketing expense as a discretionary item to assist with managing our overall cash position  including in determining which agreements we decide to pursue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
general and administrative expense primarily consists of employee salaries and benefits  outsourced services  bad debt expense  billing and collection costs  occupancy costs  legal and provisioning costs 
the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to the growth of our wholesale services during and the increased cost of maintaining and supporting lines and employees 
the significant general and administrative expense line items that increased in compared  to were as follows payroll and related expenses million charges from our ilec gateway provided to establish and change customers services million outsourcing of customer service and collections million dispatch charges from the ilecs million contract development costs million insurance for general coverage and employee health costs million set up fees from the ilecs to establish service for new customers million the decreases in general and administrative expense were a result of improved operating and subscriber management activities which resulted in significant decreases to bad debt expense 
we also reduced various general and tax audit accruals during compared to the accruing of such expenses in the significant general and administrative expenses that decreased in compared to were as follows bad debt expense million sales and use tax expense million ilec performance credits for failure to meet certain service levels million the remaining increase of million was primarily related to the volume driven incremental costs associated with additional employees and active lines in service 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by to for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily driven by the gross accounting treatment that is applied to the wholesale services segment of our business that results in our recording certain costs  including but not limited to payroll  provisioning  ilec  billing and collection costs  that are recorded in general and administrative expense even though we are charging these costs through with zero or very little mark up 
we have improved our operating costs and overall operations  which has contributed to improved per line cost factors 
additionally  as our business services market continues to increase as a percentage of our overall retail sales  we expect the overall general and administrative cost per total retail line in service to continue to decrease  as the cost to maintain a business service line is typically less than the cost to maintain a residential line 
we anticipate general and administrative expenditures will continue to increase in total into the future to support our planned expansion of service offerings and our expected increase in residential  business and wholesale lines during we will continue to evaluate our operations for efficiencies and our employee staffing requirements as they relate to increased efficiencies or needs to expand or outsource services 
we expect to see continued improvements to the reductions of general and administrative expense as a percentage of total reported revenue in relative to depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
we anticipate an increase to our fixed asset purchases in the coming year as we introduce our voip service which is more capital intensive than our une p offering 
we also expect to purchase additional computer equipment  switching equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements as a result of our expected growth across all lines of service 

table of contents interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
interest and other income consists of interest charged to our bundled residential and business customers for not paying their bills on time and income from interest earned from our cash balance 
the decrease in was primarily due to having fewer late charges attributable to our increased subscriber management activities 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our interest expense includes late fees for vendor payments  charges related to our rfc capital corporation rfc accounts receivable agreement  capital leases and our other debt obligations 
the overall decrease in interest and other expense for the year ended december  compared to was the result of our overall increased liquidity for part of compared to the prior year period that allowed us to make more timely payments of our operating expenses while simultaneously reducing our reliance on our rfc accounts receivable facility during the middle of we also have less outstanding term debt obligations  which has contributed to lower interest payments 
we anticipate that interest expense will increase due to the increased utilization of our rfc accounts receivable agreement and our expectation of converting our current agreement to an traditional asset based loan 
we also are seeking and considering additional debt offerings and other financing options in an effort to improve our liquidity to fund our growth initiatives for income tax benefit 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset for the years ended december  and net loss attributable to common stockholders 
our net loss attributable to common stockholders improved million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
this decrease was primarily discussed above  however  there was also an increase of million for the preferred stock dividends and accretion during as a result of the additional accrual of dividends on the unpaid dividends 
results of operations by segment our reportable segments reflect strategic business units that offer similar products and service 
we have two reportable segments retail services wholesale services management evaluates the performance of each business unit based on segment results  exclusive of adjustments for unusual items that may arise 
unusual items are transactions or events that are included in our reported consolidated results but are excluded from segment results due to their nonrecurring or non operational nature 
see our segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segmented results to the consolidated financial information 
the following discussion highlights our performance in the context of these segments 
retail services segment our retail services segment includes our residential and business bundle service lines of business 
this segment also includes our long distance stand alone offering 
in we shifted to focusing on growing our business bundled services  passively investing in our residential services and harvesting the long distance offering for maximum cash flow 
the following table  in millions  summarizes our retail services business segment for compared to retail services segment for the years ended amount percentage december  change change percentage of revenues favorable favorable unfavorable unfavorable revenues bundled residential services bundled business services long distance services total revenues operating expenses network operations sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses segment results revenues 
revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the revenue growth in our residential and business lines was not enough to overcome the million decrease in our long distance services experienced in  compared to the prior year 
additionally  our arpu decreased by to for the year ended december   compared in the prior year 
there were two significant factors that contributed to this change in arpu 
first  a decrease in the access rates charges that we bill to other carriers for carrying their traffic to our customers went into effect in june of a further decrease will occur in june of also  during  to address pricing trends and to react to the highly competitive telecommunication market  we actively marketed our unlimited bundle service offering to residential customers 
the unlimited service has a lower arpu than some of our historical pricing plans  because it includes for a fixed price  unlimited domestic and local calling  in addition to all of our enhanced services 

table of contents the trend in our bundled residential service during provides some insight into the fluctuations in our revenues during the course of the year as well as points to our plans for our average bundled residential service lines and ending lines were relatively the same for both the years ended december  and the prior year 
during the first half of  we were almost exclusively focused on growing our residential services to the exclusion of any of our other lines of business 
however  at mid year management made the decision to redirect sales and marketing investment to the newly formed business services line of business  as well as to the new wholesale services relationship with sprint  neither of which existed in a meaningful fashion during most of the first half of management judged that the retail business services and wholesale services lines of business offered a superior return on investment when compared to the traditional retail residential consumer business 
in  we decided to slow our residential line growth and we were solely dependent on our wholesale services business primarily mci at the time for overall line growth 
in  we had diversified into business services to provide us with more opportunities to achieve retail line growth 
in march  we signed a marketing contract with a large communications concern that has a significant embedded base of customers 
this agreement provides our marketing partner the opportunity to market our telecommunication services to their users under a fixed and variable commissioning structure 
there are no minimums in this contract  but the success of this relationship could provide a significant growth in our retail lines in service 
if this contract does not provide a large amount of new customers we will continue to focus our retail efforts primarily on business services 
residential services will continue to generate the majority of our overall revenue and cash flow during  due to the size of the embedded customer base relative to the other lines of business even if it stays relatively flat or decreases in line count over the course of network operations 
network operations expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our network operations as a percentage of revenue increased by to for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
excluding a retroactive rate reduction of million in and million in  network expense increased by million and as a percentage of revenue during relative to the increase in network operations expense after excluding retroactive rate reductions was a result of increased long distance usage from the growth in our unlimited service offering and the mix of our customer base being spread across more states that had less favorable pricing when compared to the states in which we had customers in the prior year 
these increases have been partially offset by reductions to network operations as a result of improved internal operations and processes to minimize our network operations costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
we elected to aggressively grow residential lines during the first half of the year  and we also incurred various startup expenses related to the introduction of our business services line of business during mid although we slowed residential line growth during the second half of  the significant investment during the first half of the year  coupled with the launch of the business services caused overall sales and marketing expense to increase during when compared to specifically  the increase in our sales and marketing for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was a result of increased commission payments of million in this increase is primarily a result of the increased use of independent sales contractors during compared to the prior year 
a large portion of our business services lines are a result of an independent sales contractor agreement that requires that we pre pay the full months of the commission 
table of contents per line sold  however  if a customer they provided discontinues service before being a customer for months we reduce their payment by the pro rata portion of the month payment 
in accordance with accounting rules and industry practice the entire payment is expensed when paid 
this increase was offset by a decrease of million in savings in compared to  as a result of closing our call centers in north dakota 
the remaining increase in sales and marketing expense was a result of increased advertising  primarily during the first half of historically  we have used advertising and independent sales contractors to drive the growth of our retail residential lines 
we have also been growing an internal sales force to increase sales in our business services and our voip offering 
we also expect a recently signed agreement with a large company with millions of existing consumer customers to drive growth for our residential service offering 
this agreement involves a commission and gross profit sharing arrangement that is success based 
we expect that this agreement could significantly increase commission payments 
we continue to explore new opportunities of selling our service including our efforts to leverage the use of our pva product as a distribution medium and by pursuing partnering opportunities 
to the extent possible  we will treat sales and marketing as a discretionary item to assist with managing our overall financial results and cash flow 
we do expect sales and marketing will increase significantly during over that reported during general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
as a percentage of revenues general and administrative expense decreased by to of revenues in compared to the prior year 
the overall decrease in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was primarily a result of the following items million increase in payroll expenses as a result of adding employees to support our increased lines in service and our new business services and less work dedicated to internally designed software development that can be capitalized  million increase in contract development for work on new products and various improvements and updates to our retail service offerings  million increase in health insurance and other general insurance  as a result of the increased cost for employee health benefits and insurance for being a publicly traded company 
million increase in incorrect dispatch charges 
million decrease to bad debt expense as result of our improved customer acceptance process and subscriber management activities and the sale of previously written off receivables  which resulted in a reduction to our bad debt expense of million  million decrease in ilec credits that we received on ilec bills for the failure of the ilecs to meet certain regulatory requirements for the service provided to unbundled network element platform customers  million decrease in tax expense for certain tax accruals made in the prior year and certain reduction to these accruals during  million decrease in billing expense as a result of renegotiating various rates in our billing contracts as a result of increased volumes and improved billing practices  million decrease in provisioning expenses as a result of renegotiating the minimums in our contract with an outside vendor  and the remaining million increase was primarily the result of the increases associated with increased payroll expenses and having more average lines in service in compared to included in the retail services general and administrative expense are all employee benefits  occupancy  insurance  and other indirect or overhead related expenses as only direct costs are recorded in our wholesale services segment 
we are in the process of reviewing and possibly adopting a methodology for internal reporting purposes that would allocate these indirect and overhead related expenses to the respective segments or possibly separating these expenses from each segment 

table of contents we are planning for overall line and revenue growth during  and therefore expect general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenues as a result of the leveraging of certain elements of our fixed cost structure  although we do expect an increase in overall administrative expense in raw dollars as we incur more charges for provisioning new customers and incremental administrative costs such as billing  collections  and customer care related expense during our overall general and administrative expenses are associated with operational and fiscal improvements to our retail customer economics 
the most significant improvement was in our bad debt expense  which improved due to our improvements to customer treatments that have been applied consistently and by targeting higher quality customers from a sales and marketing perspective 
these improvements allowed us to invest in our business services segment which was primarily responsible for the increased payroll expenses in we expect to continue focusing on our retail growth and specifically our business services 
we expect our residential services to grow rapidly if our recent marketing agreement with a large communications concern is very successful 
this agreement has no minimums and is success based  with the partner being responsible for providing customers  therefore  its initial success is dependent on our partner s efforts to offer our services to its end users 
wholesale services segment our wholesale services segment includes services that we provide to other companies giving them the ability to offer telephone exchange and enhanced services to their own residential and business customers on a private label basis using us as their primary platform for delivery 
our largest customers for this service during were mci and sprint 
sprint is currently our primary wholesale services customer  as mci cancelled their agreement in october the following table  in millions  provides our wholesale services business segment for compared to wholesale services segment for the years ended amount percentage december  change change percentage of revenues favorable favorable unfavorable unfavorable revenues sprint mci other total revenues operating expenses network operations sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses segment results 
table of contents revenues 
revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our wholesale service revenues increased to of consolidated revenues in  compared to in the prior year 
we signed our wholesale services agreement with sprint in february of sprint contributed million of revenue for the year ended december  and was our primary wholesale customer during  replacing mci 
on august   mci provided us with notice that they were terminating the contract effective october  as a result of this notice we accelerated the recognition of million of deferred revenue due to the new termination date of october  prior to mci s decision to terminate the agreement early  this revenue was being recognized ratably over the life of the agreement  in accordance with gaap  with an original termination date of december  as a result of this treatment  our revenues related to mci increased  however  there was no increase to our cash flow  as the cash had already been paid in the prior year 
our business development group is actively pursuing other potential wholesale partners and is working to develop new wholesale services 
we expect that our wholesale lines in service will continue to steadily increase during this  however  does not automatically translate into increased revenue 
we employ the gross accounting method for recognizing revenue within the wholesale service business segment  therefore  we record revenue for certain services that we provide to sprint at our cost and record the off setting expense in one of the respective operating cost lines within our income statement 
these revenues and cost pass through items result in no contribution to operating profit 
therefore  to the extent that sprint decides to take over certain services that we currently provide to them  such as becoming the customer of record for the ilec bills associated with their customer base  which is occurring to an increasing extent  a decrease in reported revenues and a decrease in the off setting operating expense will result 
this action will have no direct impact on the overall profitability of the contract 
revenue per line under management will decrease but the operating contribution generated on a per line basis will stay the same 
also  our stated accounts payable will decrease  as we will no longer be incurring this liability 
in february  we signed a new wholesale services agreement with working assets funding services  inc although the expected growth from this relationship will be significantly less than that with our existing sprint agreement  it will provide some additional growth in while we expect wholesale lines in service to grow in a meaningful manner during  we predict wholesale revenue will be relatively flat  however this may change appreciably given the inherent uncertainties associated with the nature of having to apply the gross accounting treatment to the wholesale services business segment 
the primary reason for this is that the charges for ilec services are the largest revenue component of our wholesale services and with sprint becoming the customer of record for these bills our revenue will decrease while we expect income to continue to increase during network operations 
network operations expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
as stated in the revenue paragraph  sprint has decided to become the customer of record for billing purposes from the ilecs  therefore  we expect the network operations expense to decrease significantly during relative to general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the previous year 
the significant components of this expense are very similar to the administrative expenses incurred on the retail side of our business  however  we only isolate as wholesale expense those expenses that are directly associated with our wholesale services activity 
therefore  we have not allocated any indirect or corporate ie traditional overhead expenses  such as certain employee benefits  occupancy expenses  insurance expenses or other similar expenses to the wholesale services business segment 
these expenses are all currently included in the retail services segment 
the increase in general and administrative expense is a result of increased wholesale lines in service as a result of growth attributable to sprint 
the increase in general and administrative expense is the result of increased payroll expense  the outsourcing of certain functions to limit our cost exposure and increased non recurring provisioning expenses to establish service for our wholesale customers 
we expect to steadily increase headcount to support our existing wholesale customers and the possible addition of new wholesale customers 
we may transfer existing employees from our retail services to wholesale services 
as a result of this growth  we expect general and administrative expense to increase in total dollars and as a percentage of our consolidated expenses 
we have not recorded any bad debt expense for wholesale services and have not had any material write offs of receivables 
we will continue to monitor our wholesale services and determine the appropriate bad debt methodology based on each individual wholesale contract  but we do not expect any material changes to our current approach 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following consolidated management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with results by segment

during  we received a million retroactive rate reduction for the unbundled network elements from verizon as a result of their settlement with the new york public service commission 

table of contents restructuring charge 
during  we closed two call centers in north dakota and our new york sales office 
we recorded million for termination benefits  lease abandonment and lease settlement costs 
asset impairment 
we recorded and million of expenses related to impaired assets in and  respectively 
this expense was the result of management s decision to reduce telemarketing activity levels 
in  a majority of the operations and assets of telemarketing centers acquired from touch during the prior year were either voluntarily closed or sold 
in addition to the goodwill impairment of million  we recorded a million charge associated with the impairment of assets  composed of million relating to unrealizable software and development projects  million of a worthless telemarketing property and equipment  and million of securities deemed to be worthless 
as a result of management s decision in the second quarter of to stabilize its future operating cash flows and operating earnings  we closed the remaining call centers in north dakota and recorded a million asset impairment charge 
mci bankruptcy 
during  we recorded million for possible bad debt exposure to carrier receivables as a result of mci s bankruptcy filing 
we reversed million of previously recorded revenue and recorded an additional million of additional bad debt expense 
wholesale development costs 
during  we began to provide wholesale telephone service 
in connection with development activities  we recorded start up costs associated with this new line of business of approximately million 
write down of accounts receivable 
included in the general and administrative expense was a write off of accounts receivable that resulted in million of additional bad debt expense 
revenues 
revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the average z linehome and z linebusiness customer count of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year 
additionally  the decrease in touch long distance lines in service contributed an additional decrease of million to our revenues 
the following table outlines the approximate number of subscriber lines for z linehome and touch long distance services as of the end of each period type of service december  december  z linehome and z linebusiness touch long distance services the reduction in lines in service was a result of our effort to slow growth for the first three quarters of  while eliminating poor paying customers and increasing the quality of our embedded subscriber base with respect to payment experience 
these decreases were somewhat off set by the introduction of our wholesale services line of business which contributed million to our revenues for the nine months that we offered this service during the following table  in millions  provides a summary of our revenues for the years ended and type of revenues z linehome and z linebusiness touch long distance services wholesale services total our service offerings  z linehome and z linebusiness  accounted for of our total revenues in  compared to the prior year 
network operations 
network operations expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the prior year 
our network operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the decrease in network operation expenses was primarily the result of having an overall lower average number of subscriber lines in service for the year ended compared to the prior year 

table of contents in addition  in early  the new york public service commission the commission approved a settlement  which reduced the prices that we and other competitive local exchange carriers paid for unbundled network elements and expanded the availability of those elements 
specifically  rates for the elements comprising the unbundled network element platform were reduced by approximately to per month per subscriber  on average 
these rate decreases were effective march  in addition  the commission directed verizon to provide bill credits to us in the amount of million to implement retroactive rate decreases for unbundled local switching 
we recorded this credit during and had received the entire credit from verizon as of december  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our continued decrease in sales and marketing expense was largely attributable to our primary focus on conserving cash and focusing on improving internal operating performance and increasing the overall quality of our subscriber base 
as a component of this effort  we decreased marketing activity levels which contributed to a decrease in active lines of  or about during our primary source of sales in was from independent sales representatives 
it was not until the last quarter of that we amended our approach to once again pursue line growth 
at that time we began a multi faceted marketing campaign in atlanta  georgia that combined radio  billboard  and television advertising to launch our new service offering  pva 
in addition to our marketing campaign we also contracted with several independent sales representatives during the latter half of that contributed to our fourth quarter net line growth 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during prior year 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily related to the write off of accounts receivables in that resulted in the recognition of million of additional bad debt expense 
excluding the million of bad debt expense  general and administrative expense decreased only million during and represented of revenues in  compared to in this increase as a percentage of revenues was largely the result of our decision in to continue focusing on improving internal operations  our product offerings and on subscriber economics  rather than investing in line growth for most of the year 
excluding the write off  our decreased line count and increased focus on internal operations resulted in lower bad debt expense  decreased billing and collection expenses and less salary and benefit expenses  all of which contributed to our reduced general and administrative expenses in compared to asset impairment charge 
asset impairment charges decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the decrease in asset impairment is the result of the closure of the remaining north dakota call centers in after closing substantially all of the centers in as a result of management s decision in the second quarter of to enhance future cash flow and operating earnings  we decided to close the remaining call centers in north dakota acquired in our acquisition of touch in april of  we announced a restructuring plan that included a reduction in force and the closure of the north dakota call centers resulting in an asset impairment charge totaling million for property  plant  and equipment sold in conjunction with the settlement of the leases in these locations  in the second quarter of wholesale development costs 
wholesale development costs were million in we incurred these costs  related to the initiation of our wholesale services offerings  during the first quarter of restructuring charge 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in in april of  we approved and implemented a restructuring to enhance our future cash flows and operating earnings 
the restructuring included a reduction of force coupled with the closure of our north dakota call centers and our new york sales office 
in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  the restructuring costs were recognized as liabilities at the time management committed us to the plan 
management determined that these costs provided no future economic benefit to us 
the restructuring charge includes termination benefits and lease abandonment costs 
in addition  we agreed to a settlement to exit the two leases for our call centers in north dakota as of july  all termination benefits and settlements to exit the leases in north dakota were paid as of december  we have recorded a lease abandonment charge representing the future lease payments for the new york office as a liability and payments exist through august depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the slight increase in depreciation and amortization is a function of the amount of capital investment that we record relative to the amount of depreciation that we record against our embedded fixed assets 
there has been relatively little change in the amount of capital investment that we have made over the past several years  nor have we significantly altered our depreciation policy over this time 

table of contents interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
interest and other income consists of interest charged to our z linehome customers for not paying their bills on time and income from interest earned from our cash balance and any gains from the sale of investments or securities 
the decrease for was primarily due to our having an overall average of fewer customers in service in compared to  and due to our more effective treatment of poor paying customers resulting in fewer delinquencies and more timely payments by customers 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our interest expense is a result of late fees for vendor payments  charges related to our rfc capital corporation rfc accounts receivable agreement  capital leases and other debt obligations 
the overall increase in interest expense was a result of million of increased late payment fees paid for network costs in compared to this increase was offset by reduced interest expense on our debt obligations 
the charges for the utilization of our accounts receivable arrangement with rfc during remained consistent with the prior year expenses  although we decreased our sale of receivables during the second half of income tax benefit 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the years ended december  and results of operations by segment management evaluates the performance of each business unit based on segment results  exclusive of adjustments for special items 
special items are transactions or events that are included in our reported consolidated results but are excluded from segment results due to their nonrecurring or non operational nature 
see our segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segmented results to the consolidated financial information 
in addition  when changes in our business affect the comparability of current versus historical results  we will adjust historical operating information to reflect the current business structure

revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in z linehome customers in compared to the decrease in touch long distance lines in service contributed an additional decrease of million to our revenues 
these decreases were a result of focusing our efforts primarily on establishing and growing our wholesale services  which were launched during  which partially reduced our focus from our retail services business 
therefore  retail services revenues decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenues to for  compared to during the prior year 
we changed our focus to once again increasing the line growth within our retail business segment during the final quarter of network operations 
network operations expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
our gross margin percentage increased to for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
excluded from this improved gross margin for is a million retroactive reduction to network access rates in new york  including this item  network operations expense would have decreased by million from and gross margin  as a percentage of retail services revenues would have been for our network operations expense as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily as a result of decreases in the unbundled network element platform rates that we paid to lease lines from the ilecs in the states in which we were operating and more specifically the rate reduction in new york  our then largest market with of our z linehome and z linebusiness revenues 
other reductions resulted from improvements we made to internal operations and processes that mitigated our network operations costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
we continued to more actively conserve cash during  which resulted in less than historically reported sales and marketing expenses in general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense increased by to of revenues in compared to the prior year 
this increase excluded special items in of million of bad debt expense related to the worldcom bankruptcy and the accounts receivable write down totaling million of bad debt expense 
including these special items  general and administrative expense decreased by million during and was of revenues compared to for the prior year 
the increase as a percentage of revenues before special items was the result of our decision in to focus on improving internal operations  expanding product offerings and improving subscriber economics rather than investing in line growth for most of during retail services was of consolidated segment general and administrative expense 
included in the retail services general and administrative expense is all employee benefits  occupancy  insurance  and other indirect or overhead related expenses  as only direct costs are recorded in our wholesale services segment 

table of contents wholesale services segment this was the first annual discussion of our results by segment because prior to april  we had only one business segment  retail services 
therefore  the wholesale services segment has no results

revenues were million  or of consolidated revenue for these revenues were primarily from our wholesale contract with mci 
network operations 
network operations expense was million  or of consolidated network operations expense 
this expense will vary depending on each individual wholesale services contract 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense was million  or of consolidated general and administrative expense 
the significant components of this expense are similar to our consolidated expenses  however  we only record the direct expenses associated with our wholesale services within the wholesale business segment 
therefore  we have not allocated any indirect or corporate ie overhead related expenses such as employee benefits  occupancy costs  insurance expenses or other administrative expenses to the wholesale services business segment 
these expenses are all included in the retail services segment 
we received pre prepayments from mci for our wholesale services as a result of their bankruptcy filing on a post petition basis  and did not record any bad debt expense for the wholesale services portion of our overall relationship 
liquidity and capital resources the competitive local telecommunications service business is traditionally considered to be a relatively capital intensive business  owing to the significant investments required in fiber optic communication networks and in the collocation of switching and transmission equipment in incumbent local exchange carriers central offices 
although we have historically utilized une p to provide our services to our own end users  we are also now working on a voip initiative which will likely involve more capital expenditures than the une p based model has typically required 
we will continue providing our une p based services  but our focus will increasingly move towards utilizing voip as an access method whereby we will provide service to our own end users 
in  we plan to launch voip in at least two markets tampa  florida and atlanta  georgia 
we expect to significantly expand this offering over the coming years 
we will continue to devote significant amounts of our capital resources to continued operations  software development  new service offerings and the marketing efforts that we have designed to achieve penetration of our target markets 
we have incurred accumulated losses since our inception as a result of developing our business  performing ongoing research and development  building and maintaining our network infrastructure and technology  the sale and promotion of our services  and ongoing administrative expenditures 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  a net tax operating loss carryforward of million  and million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have funded our expenditures primarily through operating revenues  private securities offerings  a sale leaseback credit facility  an accounts receivable factoring facility and an initial public offering that raised net proceeds of million 
we intend to continue building our organization in anticipation of future growth and we believe that our operating expenditures will also continue to increase 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was a result of our net loss after excluding non cash items  which increased by million while overall working capital only improved by million 
included in our net cash operating activities was the sale of and million of receivables  for net proceeds of and million  as of december  and  respectively 
a net receivable servicing asset of and million is included in accounts receivable and and million of advances on unbilled receivables are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of december  and  respectively 
the costs relating to the agreement of  and million is included in interest and other expense for years ended december   and  respectively 
the rfc agreement allows us to sell up to million of receivables  subject to the selection criteria utilized by rfc for the receivables they agree to purchase 
there were no minimum sales requirements under this agreement 
rfc purchased our receivables from us at a discount of  prior to march  rfc purchased our receivables at a discount rate 
our collection percentages during and were and  respectively 
under the agreement we were responsible for the continued servicing of the receivables and any amount collected over the discount rate was paid to us by rfc for providing the servicing less certain fees 
our net cash used in investing activities improved by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
nearly all the improvement was attributable to the purchasing of less property and equipment during and the financing of million of equipment purchases in we expect our capital expenditures to increase during  however  we expect to obtain financing for these purchases 
as we move toward a voip business model from our une p model our capital expenditures are expected to increase in the coming years due to the more capital intense requirements of voip 
also  the expected growth in our retail and wholesale business will increase capital expenditures 
our net cash used in financing activities improved by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million the prior year 
this improvement is primarily a result of receiving the repayment of million from an executive who is also a member of the board of directors in fulfillment of a note payable for the issuance of common stock and million for the exercise of stock options 
these increased financing inflows were reduced by a million increase to the payments on long term debt and capital leases 
we expect our total debt to increase during because of a new asset based loan agreement we expect to obtain in the near term 
we expect that this agreement will replace the accounts receivable agreement that we have with rfc 
this new agreement should be reported as a loan and therefore  will be recorded as a financing transaction  as opposed to the rfc agreement  which is recorded as an operating cash flow it is a factoring facility as opposed to a traditional asset based loan 
as it is currently contemplated the new asset based loan will include more of our accounts receivable in the borrowing base calculation than was historically the case with rfc  therefore  proving us with some additional liquidity 
we also have received payments on related party notes receivable and additional exercises of stock options during which will provided additional improvement to our liquidity position for we currently have agreements with two long distance carriers to provide transmission and termination services for all of our long distance traffic 
these agreements generally provide for the resale of long distance services on a per minute basis and contain minimum volume commitments 
as a result of a settlement of a billing dispute associated with minimum volume commitments required in one of the contracts we have agreed to pay an increased per minute charge for minutes until the achievement of certain minimum minute requirements which we expect to meet in the first half of once we meet the new agreed upon minimum minutes we will revert to the terms of our original agreement 
all other terms of the original agreement continue in full force 
we believe that we will be fully in compliance with all minimum volume commitments during as of december  had recorded an accrual for million  our estimated of the remaining estimated payments 
anticipated sources and uses of cash we diversified our sources and uses of cash during and will continue to do so during when we discuss positive cash flow throughout this section we are referring to the cash inflows and incremental cash outflows  exclusive of fixed and overhead operating costs such as administrative payroll expenses  non operations related payroll expenses  occupancy costs  and other costs that are of a corporate or overhead nature 
these corporate overhead expenses were million for the year ended december  we believe it is appropriate to have this discussion in order to understand our individual contribution streams  while realizing that these streams must provide enough cash flow to fund our corporate overhead 
our residential service provides most of our cash from operations 
we also continue to utilize the long distance service as a positive cash generating business  primarily because of our policy of not actively investing in it  other than the ongoing maintenance costs associated with this line of business 
our wholesale services business is also a good source of cash flow 
although not as significant in volume as our 
table of contents residential business  it provides a healthy net cash contribution on a per line basis without causing us to incur traditional upfront sales and marketing costs  out of pocket  as is typically the case with traditional retail activities 
we expect to spend most of investing in the growth of our business services  which should provide a positive cash flow in finally  we are continuing our access method diversification into voip  in an effort to provide services that are not largely dependent on une p 
we expect to invest in this business throughout  without any significant positive net cash contribution until we believe we are well positioned for growth during because of these diversified business models which provide us with more avenues for growth opportunity and less dependence on any one model for success 
we also recognize the importance of managing the timing and ongoing economics of this growth as it relates to our overall cash and financial position 
our ongoing capital requirements will depend on several factors  including market acceptance of our services  the amount of resources that we devote to investments in our networks and facilities  the build out of additional enterprise management centers  the ongoing development of services and brand promotions  the resources that we devote to the sales and marketing of our services  and many other factors 
we will continue to provide our back office services and the technology that we have developed to other companies seeking the capability of offering residential and small business telecommunications services on a private label basis to residential and business customers 
as growth and opportunities arise  we expect to make strategic investments in technology and our network architecture and enter potential strategic alliances or partnerships with other entities 
we expect to continue to finance our capital expenditures mostly from internally generated cash flow and from existing facilities 
we expect to see an overall increase in fixed assets across nearly all categories during we are currently under audit by the state of new york for our sales and use taxes 
in january of  we received a preliminary summary from the state of new york stating that we owe them million in sales and use taxes  before any possible interest or penalties  primarily due to their position that of the bundled services we offer are taxable 
although this process is still on going  we currently disagree with their calculation of the sales and use tax due on our bundled products and we believe that certain portions of the bundle are not subject to sales and use taxes 
our goal is to obtain an acceptable settlement with the state  but we believe that our methodology is appropriate  reasonable  and in compliance with the state of new york s sales and use taxes calculation 
we have made accruals based on our best estimates of the facts  but are unable to determine the final outcome at this time 
cash management we had about million in corporate expenditures during  of which million relates to non essential headcount and related expenses which would not be necessary if we were to reduce our operations to a purely maintenance approach and discontinued spending on any development of new service offerings or new business opportunities  other technological focused initiatives and investments in legal and regulatory related activities 
we believe that if the line growth materializes similar to management s expectations over the course of  we will generate overall free cash flow without any reductions to the aforementioned corporate expenditures 
we expect to reinvest this free cash flow into the business and to fund our capital expenditures for voip  any additional head count requirement and any related costs for growing our wholesale and retail service business segments 
we expect the next six months of to be challenging from a cash management perspective  however the expected closing of an asset based loan agreement will provide additional liquidity that will help us manage our payables and expected increased capital expenditures resulting from expected growth in all lines of our business 
these expenses are primarily front end loaded and should result in negative cash flows over the short term  but should become positive during the last quarter of we will continue to finance significant capital expenditures and are working with certain vendors to obtain more generous payment terms that will provide us with more flexibility during this period 
we may or may not be successful in these endeavors 
looking to the future  the most significant issue we need to address is the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock which has a current collective liquidation value of million  that either will need to be redeemed or converted in some fashion into common stock or some other type of instrument 
the redemption of this stock is not definite  as it can be converted at the option of the holder or under certain conditions the conversion may be forced by us 
however  this would not likely occur until our common stock price increases significantly 
we recognize the importance of exploring various options and alternatives to address a possible redemption that may occur as early as for a part of the preferred stock 
we also realize that these instruments may hinder our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  unless we have a viable plan to convert or redeem these securities in part or in full 
in september of  we decided to postpone a company wide salary increase 
this increase was scheduled to take place in april of  however  we are still assessing if this increase will be further postponed 
we are also exploring the possibility of granting certain employees with restricted stock in lieu of payroll increases 

table of contents debt instruments asset based loan we believe we are close to signing three year revolving credit agreement  which we expect to be completed in the next days 
we expect that this agreement will provide us with an availability to borrow up to million 
our overall availability is based on the eligibility of our accounts receivables  subject to certain limitations and advance rates 
this agreement will replace our rfc accounts receivable agreement which terminates on july  this new agreement is expected to provide us with additional liquidity as it encompasses certain accounts receivable that were not included in our prior arrangement with rfc  which was based only on our residential accounts receivable 
we believe that this new agreement will provide us with the necessary flexibility to grow our business and should include less restrictive covenants during the first three quarters of we also  as the deal is currently contemplated  have agreed to acceptable terms that we believe will provide us with the ability to access subordinated debt within the confines of the agreement  which we believe provide us with additional flexibility for future debt financing alternatives 
although we expect that we will have this agreement completed in the next days we can not assure that the agreement will be closed and that we will obtain all of the terms and conditions we discussed  in the final agreement 
we believe that this new agreement will help us to manage our short and long term cash needs  although we are still exploring other alternatives for obtaining additional funding  including but not limited to subordinated debt and certain equity transactions 
we believe that an asset based loan agreement will immediately help to improve our overall working capital position but the expected grown in our business may still result in additional liquidity needs that would have to be obtained through additional financings 
specifically  our recently signed agreement with a large communications concern with a significant embedded customer base may result in our residential service operating at a cash flow negative position until the fourth quarter of we also may need additional funds for our voip initiative which will likely be much more capital intensive than the une p business model has been historically 
the availability of cash will somewhat dictate the speed in which we will be able to roll this access method out to new cities  as there is an initial cost of about million in capital expenditures to establish service in a major metropolitan areas 
after this initial cost there are the additional costs of the customer premise equipment and installation and provisioning costs to get customers onto the service but these costs are success based and will move in tandem with new customers but will require larger up front payments than we currently experience to get a customer up and running with une p services 
however  in the longer term the network costs for these customers are much lower because of the larger capital expenditures for network bandwidth which reduces future incremental costs 
term debt we have million of remaining principal term debt as of december   of which all but million will be paid off by september this debt was assumed in the purchase of touch communications  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  in april all of this debt is paid monthly and is at a fixed interest rate of 
ilec  ixc and related disputed charges since our existence we have disputed and continue to dispute significant charges from the various ilecs  ixcs  and certain other carriers providing us services 
we have a policy of treating all charges  that we believe are without merit  that are still being presented on a bill to us on a regular basis as disputes  regardless of the age of the dispute 
we believe that the majority of these charges are without merit  however  we accrue for any the charges we believe represent valid charges against us 
our outstanding disputes at december  totaling million 
these disputes are summarized in the following table oustanding disputes at december  in millions alternatively billed services mci fixed facility charges verizon back billing of installation charges late fees for non payment of disputed charges all others 
table of contents alternatively billed services are primarily charges for certain  collect and information service calls 
these disputes are largely historic in nature 
we settled certain of these disputes in texas with southwestern bell telephone company 
we remit all monies collected associated with these services but do not pay the charges unless we collect from our customers 
we believe that our liability related to these charges should be capped at the amount remitted by our end users  however  some of our settlements have included payments in excess of payments from our customers 
therefore  we have accrued million for alternatively billed services as of december  the mci fixed facility charge dispute is over years old 
although we have received communications from mci that these charges are not valid  they have never removed these charges from their billings to us 
we received a billing for million from verizon relating to the back billing of dispatch charges believed to relate to the period from august to february and from march to september we do not know if this is the entire amount they will bill related to these back billed charges 
our policy is to dispute items that are billed without the necessary underlying detail records and therefore  we have disputed these charges 
we expect that if any of these charges are valid  a portion of these charges may be subject to being billed to our wholesale services customers for services that we provided under our contracts with them 
we have not received sufficient detail related to these charges from verizon and therefore  are unable to determine their validity 
the late fees are accumulating from all of our disputes as we do not pay for disputed items and therefore incur and accumulate late fee for these disputed billings 
the remaining million of disputes relates to various disputes primarily with ilecs for incorrect rates  duplicate billing  charges for customers for whom we are no longer providing service and other billing errors 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for our disputes and manage our cash position to insure that we have the necessary availability of cash to make payments which may arise out of the loss of disputes that we believe are at risk 
therefore  we believe our maximum cash exposure for these charges is million 
however  we do not believe that these charges are valid and intend to continue our dispute and non payment of these charges 
contractual obligations the following table  in thousands  discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases capital leases mandatorily redeemable preferred stock redemption unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have no other significant off balance sheet items 
related party transactions in january  we accelerated the vesting of  stock options granted to an executive as part of his severance agreement 
this acceleration resulted in the employee being fully vested in stock options with a strike price of when the stock was trading at 
we recorded approximately million in general and administrative expense as a result of this transaction

in february we received a payment to million from an executive officer who is also on our board of directors in fulfillment of an outstanding note receivable to us 
in august  we accelerated the vesting of  stock options granted to an executive as part of his severance agreement 
this acceleration resulted in the employee being fully vested in stock options with a strike price of per share when the stock was trading at per share 
as a result of this transaction we recorded approximately million in general and administrative expense 
at december   we have approximately million of notes receivable from employees and former employees for various reasons 
we have recorded approximately million of these loans as contra equity  as the loans were for the purchase of stock 
the remaining million loans were more of a personal nature and we have made an accrual for million as some of these loans are to former employees and the likelihood of collection and lack of collateral make it likely that these amounts will not be collectable 
these notes are primarily due by december with approximately million due by that date 
only two notes are due beyond this date  one is a note in the amount of approximately million  due in june  and the other is approximately million and is a demand note that currently has no specific due date 
we paid interest on our related party term debt in the amount of  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple element deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the issue also supersedes certain guidance set forth in staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the final consensus is applicable to agreements entered into in quarters beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies are permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we adopted this new pronouncement effective july   on a prospective basis 
this adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for quarters beginning july  we reviewed this new pronouncement and have concluded that none of our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock presented in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet is within the scope of sfas no 
this conclusion is based on the facts that there is not an unconditional obligation requiring the redemption of the securities because they are convertible into common at the option of the holder and the conversion option is substantial 
we recognize that the fasb is in the process of possibly promulgating additional rules in the future related to securities similar to the ones that we have in the mezzanine section  but are unable to determine what any future rule s impact might have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
sab clarifies existing guidance regarding revenues for contracts which contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with eitf no

risks related to our financial condition and our business availability and favorable pricing of unbundled network components 
our business strategy depends on a continued availability of ilec unbundled network components and on states maintaining and adopting favorable pricing rules for ilec unbundled network components 
approximately of our revenues are derived from the use of ilec networks 
the fcc has issued rules regarding access to key components of the ilec networks  including transport and switching 
a recent court ruling  however  has created considerable legal uncertainty regarding this access

ilecs  after some period of time  could deny us access to their networks in violation of interconnection agreements and essentially destroy our ability to provide our services 
ilecs could refuse new service orders  including repair and change orders 
we would not be able to add new customers 
our business would diminish because of normal customer churn  that is  the normal loss of existing customers over time 
our customer churn could increase as our customers return to ilec services in response to the uncertainty 
ilecs could significantly raise the prices they charge for access to their networks 
we would be forced to raise our rates to non competitive levels 
vendors  including long distance companies  could alter the terms under which they do business with us  such as credit terms  thereby increasing our costs and diminishing our cash flow and liquidity

our wholesale customers may decline to expend marketing resources to increase their customer bases 
we could lose major marketing partners and potential marketing partners as they decline to expend resources in marketing our services 
we could lose key personnel  as they seek security in offers from other prospective employers 
the cost of litigation and of participation in administrative proceedings relating to interconnection agreements and new regulations could be excessively burdensome 
the availability of favorable pricing rules for unbundled network components is another key element of our business strategy 
the public utilities commissions of certain states have adopted pricing rules for unbundled network components 
in general  ilecs are required to provide us with access to their networks at forward looking  long run incremental cost based prices 
however  we cannot be certain that unbundled network components will continue to be available at favorable prices in those states or that other states will ever adopt favorable pricing  particularly in light of the recent dc circuit court ruling referred to above 
emerging industry sector 
we are in a new  emerging sector of the telecommunications industry 
our experience  as well as the experience of others  in this sector is limited 
as a result we could encounter numerous unforeseen difficulties and challenges 
uncertainties relating to wholesale initiative 
our wholesale initiative is still developing 
we believe we are the first competitive local exchange carrier to offer wholesale local exchange services 
we undoubtedly will encounter unforeseen delays  capital expenditures and upfront costs  regulatory and legal issues which may include legal challenges to our wholesale strategy by incumbent local exchange carriers  technical difficulties and other challenges 
there can be no assurance that we will overcome these challenges successfully or without expenditure of substantial resources 
moreover  since we must pay the incumbent local exchange carrier fees relating to local telephone usage by both our retail and wholesale customers  we will be highly dependent upon our wholesale customers 
their failure to pay fees to us may make it difficult or impossible for us to pay fees to the incumbent local exchange carriers upon which we rely 
rapid expansion 
we are attempting to grow our business rapidly in terms of the number of services we offer  the number of customers we serve and the regions we serve 
we are expending substantial sums in anticipation of increased sales resulting from a new marketing partner relationship 
there can be no assurance this marketing initiative will be launched as expected or that it will be successful  particularly in light of the legal and regulatory uncertainties described elsewhere in this report 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will successfully manage our efforts to expand  train  manage and retain our employee base  
table of contents expand and improve our customer service and support systems and improve the performance of billing systems  introduce and market new products and services and new pricing plans in addition to z linehome and our other service offerings  enhance and upgrade the features of our software  capitalize on new opportunities in the competitive marketplace  or control our expenses 
the strains posed by these demands are magnified by the emerging nature of our operations 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
difficulties in expanding network infrastructure 
we must continue to develop  expand and adapt our network infrastructure as the number of our users and the amount of information they wish to access and transfer increases and as our customers demands change 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to develop  expand or adapt the network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing requirements on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
if we fail to expand our network infrastructure on a timely basis or adapt it to either changing customer requirements or evolving industry standards  these failures could cause our business to perform poorly 
ability to resell long distance services 
we offer long distance telephone services as part of our service packages 
we currently have agreements with various long distance carriers to provide transmission and termination services for all of our long distance traffic 
recently  several long distance carriers have encountered financial difficulties  including both carriers utilized by us 
financial difficulties encountered by any of our carriers could cause disruption of service to our customers and could diminish the value of any receivables or credits that may be due to us from such carriers 
our agreements with long distance carriers generally provide for the resale of long distance services on a per minute basis and contain minimum volume commitments 
in cases in which we have agreed to minimum volume commitments and fail to meet them  we will be obligated to pay underutilization charges 
in some instances  if we incur underutilization charges  our basic rate will increase  which could further adversely affect our operating results 
we recently settled a dispute by agreeing to a higher rate 
risk of software failures and errors 
the software that we use and the software that we have developed internally and are continuing to develop may contain undetected errors 
although we have extensively tested our software  errors may be discovered in the software during the course of its use 
any errors may result in partial or total failure of our network  loss or diminution in service delivery performance  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete or correct development  and loss of revenue because of the inability of customers to use our products or services  which could adversely affect our business condition 
protection of proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to protect the proprietary information that we have developed 
our ability to protect our proprietary technology is limited  and we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
also  we cannot be certain that the intellectual property that incumbent local exchange carriers or others claim to hold and that may be necessary for us to provide our services will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
if we were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  we might be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may be costly or not available on commercially reasonable terms 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect our business 
dependence on information systems 
our billing  customer service and management information systems are newly developed and we may face unexpected system difficulties  which would adversely affect our service levels and  consequently  our business 
sophisticated information and processing systems are vital to our ability to monitor costs  render monthly invoices for services  process customer orders and achieve operating efficiencies 
we rely on internal systems and third party vendors  some of which have a limited operating history  to provide our information and processing systems 
if our systems fail to perform in a timely and effective manner and at acceptable costs  or if we fail to adequately identify all of our information and processing needs or if our related processing or information systems fail  these failures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our right to use third party systems is dependent upon license agreements 
some of these agreements are cancelable by the vendor  and the cancellation or nonrenewal of these agreements could seriously impair our ability to process orders or bill our customers 
as we continue to provide local telephone service  the need for sophisticated billing and information systems will also increase significantly and we will have significant additional requirements for data interface with incumbent local exchange carriers and others 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to meet these additional requirements 

table of contents network failure 
the successful operation of our network will depend on a continuous supply of electricity at multiple points 
although the system that carries signals has been designed to operate under extreme weather conditions including heavy rain  wind and snow  like all other telecommunications systems  our network could be adversely affected by such conditions 
our network  however  is equipped with a back up power supply and our existing network operations center is equipped with both a battery backup and an on site emergency generator 
if a power failure causes an interruption in our service  the interruption could negatively impact our operations 
our network also may be subject to physical damage  sabotage  tampering or other breaches of security by computer virus  break ins or otherwise that could impair its functionality 
in addition  our network is subject to unknown capacity limitations that may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for our customers 
any interruptions in service resulting from physical damage or capacity limitations could cause our systems to fail 
dependence on local exchange carriers 
we rely on incumbent local exchange carriers to supply key unbundled components of their network infrastructure to us on a timely and accurate basis  and in the quantities and quality demanded by us 
we may from time to time experience delays or other problems in receiving unbundled services or facilities which we request  and there can be no assurance that we will able to obtain such unbundled elements on the scale and within the time frames required by us 
any failure to obtain these components  services or additional capacity on a timely and accurate basis could adversely affect us 
anticipated capital needs 
if we expand more rapidly than currently anticipated or if our working capital needs exceed our current expectations  we may need to raise additional capital from debt or equity sources 
if we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all  we may be required to modify  delay or abandon our current business plan  which is likely to materially and adversely affect our business and  as a result  the value of our common stock 
we have an accounts receivable facility with rfc corporation that provides for the sale of up to million of our receivables to rfc 
this facility expires in july we are currently in negotiations to replace this facility 
dependence on third party vendors 
we currently purchase the majority of our telecommunications equipment as needed from third party vendors  including lucent technologies  inc  sonus networks  inc  dialogic communications corporation  hewlett packard company  compaq computer corporation  sun microsystems  inc and emc corporation 
in addition  we currently license our software from third party vendors  including oracle corporation  inprise corporation  mercator software  inc  microsoft corporation  nuance communications  inc  speechworks international  inc  telution  inc  ams  inc  netscape communications  inc 
and accenture 
we typically do not enter into any long term agreements with our telecommunications equipment or software suppliers 
any reduction or interruption in supply from our equipment suppliers or failure to obtain suitable software licensing terms could have a disruptive effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 
dependence on management and key personnel 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace 
if we lose the services of some of our key personnel  our business could suffer 
we currently maintain a  key man life insurance policy on the life of mr 
d 
gregory smith  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we also depend on a limited number of key management  sales  marketing and product development personnel to manage and operate our business 
in particular  we believe that our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including our engineering and technical staff 
if we are unable to attract and retain our key employees  the value of our common stock could suffer 
government regulation and legal uncertainties 
we are subject to varying degrees of federal  state  and local regulation 
we must also comply with various state and federal obligations that are subject to change  such as the duty to contribute to universal service subsidies  the impact of which we cannot assess on a going forward basis as the rates change periodically 
our failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in fines or other penalties being imposed on us  including loss of certification to provide services 
decisions of the fcc and state regulatory commissions providing incumbent local exchange carriers with increased flexibility in how they price their services and with other regulatory relief  could have a material adverse effect on our business and that of other competitive local exchange carriers 
future regulatory provisions may be less favorable to competitive local exchange carriers and more favorable to their competitors 
if incumbent local exchange carriers are allowed by regulators to engage in substantial volume and term discount pricing practices for their end user customers  or charge competitive local exchange carriers higher fees for interconnection to the incumbent local exchange carriers networks  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
incumbent local exchange carriers may also seek to delay competitors through legal or regulatory challenges  or by recalcitrant responses to requirements that they open their markets through interconnection and unbundling of network elements 
our legal and administrative expenses may be increased because of our having to actively participate in rate cases filed by incumbent local exchange carriers  in which they seek to increase the rates they can charge for the unbundled network element platform components 
our profitability may be adversely affected if those carriers prevail in those 
table of contents cases 
pending court cases  in which certain provisions of the telecommunications act of will be conclusively interpreted  may result in an increase in our cost of obtaining unbundled network elements 
we are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting slamming  which occurs when specific procedures are not followed when a customer changes telecommunications services 
although we attempt to diligently comply with all such laws and regulations and have procedures in place to prevent slamming  if violations of such laws and regulations occur  we could become subject to significant fines and penalties  legal fees and costs  and our business reputation could be harmed 
competition 
the telecommunications and information services markets are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than us 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business operations will be price  the desirability of our service offering  quality and reliability of our services  innovation and customer service 
our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to maintain high quality  market driven services at prices generally equal to or below those charged by our competitors 
competitor actions and responses to our actions could  therefore  materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face competition from a variety of participants in the telecommunications market 
the largest competitor for local service in each market in which we compete is the incumbent local exchange carrier serving that market 
incumbent local exchange carriers have established networks  long standing relationships with their customers  strong political and regulatory influence  and the benefit of state and federal regulations that favor incumbent local exchange carriers 
in the local exchange market  the incumbent local exchange carriers continue to hold near monopoly positions 
the long distance telecommunications market in which we compete has numerous entities competing for the same customers and a high average churn rate as customers frequently change long distance providers in response to the offering of lower rates or promotional incentives 
prices in the long distance market have declined significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to decline 
we will face competition from large interexchange carriers 
other competitors are likely to include incumbent local exchange carriers providing out of region and  with the removal of regulatory barriers  in region long distance services  other incumbent local exchange carriers  other competitive local exchange carriers  cable television companies  electric utilities  wireless telephone system operators  microwave and satellite carriers and private networks owned by large end users 
the telecommunications act of facilitates such entry by requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to allow competing providers to acquire local services at wholesale prices for resale and to purchase unbundled network elements at cost based prices 
a continuing trend toward combinations and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry  including potential consolidation among incumbent local exchange carriers or competitive local exchange carriers  or transactions between telephone companies and cable companies outside of the telephone company s service area  or between interexchange carriers and competitive local exchange carriers  could give rise to significant new competitors 
the enhanced and information services markets are also highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to intensify 
our competitors in these markets will include information service providers  telecommunications companies  on line service providers and internet service providers 
unauthorized transactions  theft of services 
we may be the victim of fraud or theft of service 
from time to time  callers have obtained our services without rendering payment by unlawfully using our access numbers and personal identification numbers 
we attempt to manage these theft and fraud risks through our internal controls and our monitoring and blocking systems 
if these efforts are not successful  the theft of our services may cause our revenue to decline significantly 
to date  we have not encountered material fraud or theft of our service 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments 
our operations are conducted primarily in the united states and as such are not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
we have no material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations  as substantially all of our long term debt obligations are fixed rate obligations
