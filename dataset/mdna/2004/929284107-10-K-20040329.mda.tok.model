overview we design  develop and market innovative  high performance radio frequency rf semiconductor products that target the wireless communications  broadband cable  rf identification rfid and defense and homeland security markets 
we have been designing rf devices for more than years and have developed significant expertise in rf design  semiconductor process technology and component integration 
with our team of engineering and technical employees experienced in the distinctive requirements of rf semiconductors  we seek to address the rf challenges in systems utilized in multiple markets 
beginning in the s  we began applying our rf design  semiconductor technology and integration capabilities to address the growing opportunities for commercial communications products 
when we began our operations in the commercial communications market  we initially benefited from significant increases in spending on capital equipment by communications service providers  which resulted in increased demand for our products 
however  the demand for telecommunications equipment has been very weak for the last three years  particularly effecting our wireless integrated assembly and fiber optics product lines 
we project this weakness in demand to continue in and potentially beyond based on customer forecasts for the purchase of our products 
since early  we have undertaken several strategic initiatives to focus on our competitive advantages and dedicate our resources to the rf semiconductor market 
as part of these initiatives  we sold our wireless repeater and thin film product lines and exited the fiber optic and fixed wireless assemblies markets 
we are also in the process of implementing a fully outsourced manufacturing model utilizing outside foundries for our manufacturing needs 
we believe that our shift to fully outsourced manufacturing  which we expect to complete in  will allow us to further reduce our operating costs and accelerate the time to market of our products  while continuing to provide access to advanced manufacturing technologies 
our progress in semiconductors has been driven by our rapid introduction of new  innovative products 
in and  we introduced new products  including in our first product for the rfid market  the sx  an rfid reader engine 
our commitment to providing innovative and high quality products resulted in an increase in design wins to in from in a design win occurs when a customer informs us that it has included our product in the bill of materials for a product that we expect the customer to begin shipping in the next months 
our design wins were realized in the wireless communications  broadband cable  rfid and defense and homeland security markets  demonstrating our ability to leverage our rf semiconductor expertise across multiple markets 
in addition to our internal research and development  we also collaborate with many of our customers to design and develop new semiconductors for their next generation products 
for example  we recently formed an arrangement with alien technologies to supply high performance rfid reader engines that function in partnership with alien technologies rfid systems and tags 
we are also working with a third party to design and develop new high powered amplifiers for wireless infrastructure applications that we expect to introduce in we will continue to concentrated our resources on the development of new rf semiconductors and target multiple growth markets such as rfid and defense and homeland security and expand our addressable market opportunities in wireless communications and broadband cable and expect to maintain our accelerated pace of new product introductions and design wins 
while customer interest  new product introductions  accelerating pace of design wins and new orders are encouraging  there is no assurance that they will have a positive impact on our overall sales 
since the beginning of  we have been taking aggressive steps designed to more closely align our production costs with our customers current forecasted demand for our products 
as part of this effort  we reduced our headcount and other non employee costs during and see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
during  we began to design and manufacture semiconductors utilizing other manufacturing technologies at third party foundries  which offers considerable advantages such as allowing us to focus our resources on product development and marketing  minimizing capital expenditures  reducing operating expenses  allowing us to continue to offer competitive pricing  reducing time to market  reducing technology and product risks and facilitating the migration of our products to new process technologies  which reduce costs and optimize performance 
we believe that this approach is required in order to continue to offer competitive products and expect that a greater number of our future products would be developed in this fashion 
in december  we determined that over the course of we would transition to a fully outsourced business model and we recorded related restructuring charges 
there are significant business risks associated with our dependence upon third parties for our manufacturing needs and there can be no assurance that our outsourcing strategy will be a success 
under our historical manufacturing approach we were required to make significant investments in equipment and fixed overhead 
as a result  the volume of product we produce and sell has had a significant impact on our gross profit margin  and will continue to have this effect until we complete our until we transition to a fully outsourced business model 
in addition  we typically generate lower gross margin on new product introductions 
over time  we typically become more efficient relative to new products through learning and increased volumes as well as through introducing lower cost elements to the product designs 
we expect our new product introductions to continue to be a higher percentage of our sales mix  which will continue to have a negative impact on our gross margin 
in addition  new product lines contain a greater degree of uncertainty due to a lack of visibility and predictability of customer demand and potential competition which will contribute to a higher level of inventory risk in our near future 
sales we sell our products to a broad group of communications original equipment manufacturers oems and their suppliers and subcontractors 
our major customers provide forecasted demand on at least a monthly basis  which assists us in managing our inventory requirements 
these forecasts  however  are subject to changes  including changes as a result of market conditions  and could fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we depend on a small number of customers for a majority of our sales 
sales to our customers which account for more than of our total annual sales were  in aggregate  of our sales for the year ended december  and and in and  respectively 
for the identity of our customers who contributed greater than of our total sales for each of the preceding three years and the annual amount of those sales  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we have diversified our customer base over the last few years and intend to further diversify our customer base and product offering in the future 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our products to a relatively small group of customers 
in addition  most of our sales result from purchase orders or contracts that can be cancelled on short term notice 
delays in manufacturing or supply procurement or other factors  including general market slow downs  have caused and could potentially continue to cause cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or in shipments to a significant customer 
if the markets for our products in broadband cable or wireless communications decline  fail to grow  or grow more slowly than we anticipate  the use of our products may be reduced with a significant negative impact on our sales  earnings  inventory valuations and cash flow 
revenues from product sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met the product has been shipped and title has passed to the customer  we have the right to invoice the customer at a fixed price  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining 
generally  title passes upon shipment of our products 
certain contracts are under a consignment arrangement under which title to our products does not pass until the customer utilizes these products in its production processes 
as a consequence  we recognize revenue on these contracts only when the customer notifies us of product consumption 
in addition to our internal sales efforts  we use a sole distributor richardson electronics  ltd 
to sell semiconductor products 
revenues from this distributor are recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price is fixed and determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms are fixed at shipment and are consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor has full risk of physical loss  the distributor has separate economic substance  we have no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributor s inventory  and we believe we can reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributor based on their history and our visibility in the distributor s success with its products and into the market place in general 
based on specific terms of the customer contract or purchase order  we may negotiate a final delivery and settlement in connection with customer order cancellations 
due to the uncertain and lengthy nature of these negotiations  a substantial portion  if not all  of the inventory subject to the cancellation may be written off 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached final agreement with one customer and recognized revenue of million related to the delivery of specific fixed wireless products that have previously been written off 
in the first quarter of  we completed a second fixed wireless contract with one customer resulting in million of sales for final product delivery 
substantially all of this inventory had been written off in in the second quarter of  we completed our largest long haul fiber optic contract for our oc dielectric resonator oscillator dro resulting in million of sales 
the inventory sold had been previously written down by approximately million to an adjusted cost basis of approximately million in the first quarter of the resulting margin was similar to other deliveries of this product 
in the future  we anticipate that similar arrangements for final deliveries could be made with other customers upon completion of major contracts  however there can be no assurance that this will occur 
generally  the selling prices of our products decrease over time as a result of increased volumes or general competitive pressures 
we expect that prices will continue to decline as a result of volume increases or these competitive pressures 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct material costs of product components  production wages  taxes and benefits  costs of assembly and test by third party contract manufacturers  wafer costs from third party semiconductor foundries  labor contracted on a temporary basis  supplies consumed in the manufacturing process  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing and test equipment and leasehold improvements  lease expense for our manufacturing facilities  allocated occupancy costs  scrapped material used in the production process  and write downs of excess and obsolete inventory 
we recognize cost of goods sold upon recognition of revenue 
we recognize losses on contracts  including purchase order commitments  when identified 
we have not recognized any such losses during  or operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into two general categories research and development  and selling and administrative 
we classify all charges to these two categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each of these two categories includes expenses that are unique to the category type  there are commonly recurring expenditures that are typically included in these categories  such as wages  fringe benefit costs  depreciation and allocated overhead 
research and development research and development expense represents wages  supplies and allocated overhead costs to design  develop and improve products and processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense consists primarily of wages  travel and facility costs incurred by and other expenses allocated to our selling and administrative departments 
selling and administrative expense also includes manufacturer representatives and distributor sales commissions  trade show and advertising expenses and fees and expenses of legal  accounting  and other professional consultants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we have recorded deferred stock compensation representing the differential between the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and the exercise price for employee stock options or restricted stock 
we are amortizing this amount using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options and stock granted 
recapitalization merger and other in september we announced the receipt of a proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc fox paine to acquire all of the shares of the company s common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders the acquisition proposal 
on march   fox paine withdrew its acquisition proposal 
our and recapitalization merger and other expense is a non recurring expenditure comprised of expenses incurred by the special committee to our board of directors to review the proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc to acquire all of the shares of our common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders for per share in cash 
these expenses include legal and financial consulting fees as well as compensation to the members of the special committee 
restructuring charge our restructuring charge reflects our decision to abandon a leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
it is comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge on tenant improvements 
in determining this estimate  we have made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and have reflected off setting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate based on the current market conditions 
our restructuring charge reflects further consolidation and abandonment of leased space and associated impairment of tenant improvements  severance costs  an asset impairment charge and the initiation of a program to sell excess manufacturing equipment resulting from the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  especially related to our fiber optics products 
the restructuring charge also includes an additional charge for the leased facility we abandoned in based on our downward revised assumptions regarding sublease occupancy rates and market rates due to an overall deteriorating real estate market and difficulties encountered in subleasing the available space 
also during  we recorded a restructuring charge related to our decision in december to completely outsource our internal wafer fabrication within one year 
as a result of the planned fab closure  we have accrued associated severance expenses  accrued the eventual abandonment of additional excess space for which we will have a remaining two year commitment and recorded an impairment on our internal wafer fabrication equipment and related leasehold improvements 
during  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for the four month additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this credit was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates and disposal of our remaining unsold assets held for sale 
we also reversed a portion of our severance accrual for one employee slated to be terminated but instead retained for another position 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continuous basis  we evaluate all our significant estimates including those related to doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring including accruals for abandoned lease properties  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a detailed discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and sab no 
 revenue recognition 
these sabs require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
revenues from our distributor are recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price is fixed and determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms are fixed at shipment and are consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor has full risk of physical loss  the distributor has separate economic substance  we have no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributor s inventory  and we believe we can reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributor based on their history and our visibility in the distributor s success with its products and into the market place in general 
we accrue for distributor right of return  authorized price reductions for specific end customer sales opportunities and price protection based on known events and historical trends 
through the amount of those reserves has not been material 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
write down of excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production generally based on a rolling eighteen month demand forecast  current economic trends and historical write offs when evaluating the valuation of our inventory 
due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
material differences in estimates of excess and obsolete inventory may result in the amount and timing of cost of sales for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies we have established reserves for income tax contingencies in the amount of million 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities including our federal tax filings for to which are currently under examination 
the reserves represent our best estimate of our liability of income taxes  interest and penalties 
the actual liability could differ significantly from the amount of the reserve  which could have a material effect on our results of operations 
in addition  as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax provision benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current income tax provision benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring during fiscal and  we recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting certain product lines or businesses and the costs of downsizing our business 
such charges were established in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these charges include abandoned leased properties comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and asset impairment charges on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining these estimates  we make certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
should there be a further significant change in market conditions  the ultimate losses on these could be higher and such amount could be material 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to restructuring activities initiated in and also recorded additional charges of million related to restructuring activities initiated in  primarily due to changes in estimated sublease income 
during  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for the four month additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this credit was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process obsolete 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
during  we recognized an asset impairment of million for assets held and used and million for assets held for sale 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of our long lived assets could occur 
current operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
as a result of our new products  changing market conditions and other factors  the historical percentages and comparisons set forth below may not reflect our expected future operations

the decline in sales from to primarily reflects the decline in our wireless assembly sales as these products near the end of their life cycle as well as our strategic decisions in to to focus on our competitive advantages and dedicate our resources to the rf semiconductor market by selling our wireless repeater and thin film product lines and exiting the fixed wireless assembly and fiber optics markets 
the decline in sales from to resulted primarily from a decline in the sale of our wireless assembly products due to overall reduction of capital spending by communication service providers resulting in our customers attempting to reduce their inventory levels of our products 
fiber optic sales also declined significantly due to the oversaturation of the long haul fiber optic market 
semiconductor sales during totaled million  representing of total sales which was a million or increase in comparison to sales of million of total sales and our semiconductor sales decreased  or in comparison to sales of million of total sales 
our semiconductor sales includes sales of rf semiconductor products as well as sales of our thin film products which represents approximately  million and million for  and  respectively 
in may we sold our thin film product line to m a com a unit of tyco electronics 
our rf semiconductor sales increased million or to million in from million in and our rf semiconductor sales decreased  or from to million in the increase in our rf semiconductor sales from to related to an increase in the volume of our rf semiconductor products sold due  in part  to our introduction of over new products and our increasing sales in asia particularly china  which accounted for of total sales in compared to in 
based on our current backlog at december  and customer forecasts  we expect that rf semiconductor sales in the first quarter of will increase from the million of sales recorded during the fourth quarter of wireless assembly sales for totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of million or from sales of million of total sales in our wireless assembly sales decreased million or from sales of million in  or of total sales 
the decrease in wireless assembly sales in related to a drop in the volume of our wireless assembly products sold as these products are nearing the end of their product life cycle 
the decrease in wireless assembly sales in resulted primarily from the overall reduction of capital spending by communication service providers resulting in our customers attempting to reduce their inventory levels of our products 
also  we made the decision in early to exit the fixed wireless assembly market 
wireless assembly sales for included million for final product delivery of our last major fixed wireless contract 
the decline in our wireless assembly sales  including fixed wireless assembly sales  over the last two years caused the decline in our sales in the united states and contributed to the decline in our sales to europe 
these products have reached the end of their product life cycle and will not be a significant factor in our long term business 
aside from potential and infrequent life time buys  our focus will predominantly be repair and maintenance of the existing product base 
fiber optic sales were  in  representing less than of total sales 
we exited the fiber optic market in mid based on the protracted lack of demand for long haul fiber optic products 
fiber optic sales in represents sales of residual inventory  primarily manufactured in prior years 
fiber optic sales in totaled million  representing of total sales a decrease of million or from sales of million of total sales in fiber optic sales declined significantly in due to the oversaturation of the long haul fiber optic market which caused a significant reduction in demand for our fiber optic products 
the decline in our fiber optic sales over the last two years caused the decline in our sales to canada nad contributed to the decline in our sales to europe 
there will be no more sales from our fiber optic products in future periods 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for was million  a decrease of million or as compared with cost of goods sold of million in as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold decreased to in from in this decrease in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for reflects the change in our product sales mix to a greater percentage of higher margin semiconductor products from relatively lower margin wireless assembly products and the cost reductions generated by our restructuring program implemented in our third quarter of including reductions in wages and benefits  rent  and depreciation expenses 
these reduced costs were partially offset by additional expenses incurred to transition our semiconductor manufacturing processes to outside foundries 
in absolute dollars  the decrease in our cost of goods sold reflects the factors previously noted as well as our decline in sales during our cost of goods sold was million in as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold decreased to of sales in from in the decrease in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales primarily relates to the following costs which were incurred in a million write down of excess and obsolete inventory  approximately  of severance expenses related to manufacturing personnel  and high variable costs on fixed wireless products which were being transitioned into manufacturing 
the million write down of excess and obsolete inventory largely related to inventory ordered to build base station products for our largest mobile wireless customer 
inventory levels of this product were purchased based on this customer s forecasted demand which had since been revised downward 
in addition  given the overall slowdown in market demand  we made write downs for other product lines where customer forecasts have significantly declined 
during  our cost of goods sold benefited from the sale of million of fixed wireless cpe inventory  which had previously been written down by million in due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
in addition  cost of goods sold benefited from a reduction of approximately million in salaries  fringe benefits and payroll taxes due to our manufacturing workforce reductions initiated during our cost of goods sold also benefited from an insurance settlement of approximately  for raw material inventory stolen in in absolute dollars  the decrease in our cost of goods sold reflects the factors noted above as well as our decline in sales during we have continued to experience a significant amount of unabsorbed overhead costs related to the increased manufacturing infrastructure we put in place to support our customers demand in the second half of this increased infrastructure includes  among other things  a new manufacturing facility and investments in equipment 
our restructuring program mitigated our unabsorbed overhead through the write down of excess facilities and equipment  but we will still have fixed manufacturing costs that these efforts will not impact until we complete our transition to a fully outsourced business model 
in addition  we typically generate lower gross margin on new product introductions which we expect to be a higher percentage of our sales mix going forward 
over time  we typically become more efficient relative to new products through learning and increased volumes as well as through introducing lower cost elements to the product designs 
new product lines also contain a greater degree of inventory risk due to uncertainty regarding a lack of visibility and predictability of customer demand and potential competition 
research and development our research and development for was million  a decrease of approximately million or as compared with research and development expense of million in our research and development expense increased by approximately  or as compared with our research and development expense of million for the decrease in absolute dollars in is primarily related to a decrease in procured materials used in our research and development 
research and development efforts in and were primarily attributable to spending on the development of rf semiconductor products 
during  we greatly increased our expenditures on rf semiconductor development projects while significantly reducing or eliminating development efforts on other product lines 
research and development efforts in were attributable to increased spending on the development of fixed wireless broadband cpe  new rf semiconductor and new fiber optic products 
during  research and development expenses were as a percentage of sales which compares to in and in the increases in research and development expense as a percentage of sales from to and from to relates to our decline in sales 
product research and development is essential to our future success and we expect to continue to make investments in new product development and engineering talent 
in we will focus our research efforts and resources on rf semiconductor development which target multiple growth markets such as rfid and defense and homeland security and while expanding our addressable market opportunities in wireless communications and broadband cable 
we will also explore process capabilities of third party foundries and develop products under new process technologies such as sige bicmos 
in absolute dollars  we expect our research and development expenditures to remain relatively constant with the prior year 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales  a decrease of approximately  or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily related to  of cost reductions generated by our restructuring program implemented in our third quarter of including reductions in wages and benefits  rent and tax expenses 
additionally  we benefited from a  reduction in our board of directors compensation plan that was approved at our annual meeting of stockholders held on july  these reduced expenses were partially offset by a  increase in insurance premiums  a  increase in commission costs due to increased sales of our rf semiconductor products and a  increase in bonus expense 
selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales 
the decrease in absolute dollars from to is primarily related to reduced commission  advertising and promotion expenses  legal expenses and rent expense 
the reduced rent expense is related to our decision to abandon our new leased facility in september see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
until that time  the rent expense for that excess office space was included in selling and administrative expense 
as a percentage of sales  the increase in selling and administrative expenses from to and to reflects the decline in sales over the three year period 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of   and  for  and  respectively  is related to the granting of restricted stock during and at a price below fair market value and the issuance of employee stock options during at prices deemed below fair market value 
included in the total deferred stock compensation described above is   and  for  and  respectively  which is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the balance of our remaining unamortized deferred stock compensation was approximately  to be amortized over the next months 
recapitalization merger we incurred recapitalization merger expense of  in and  in related to our consideration of the acquisition proposal from fox paine 
these expenses include legal and financial consulting fees as well as compensation to the members of the special committee 
on march   fox paine withdrew its acquisition proposal 
restructuring charges during  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for the four month additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this credit was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates and disposal of our remaining unsold assets held for sale 
we also reversed a portion of our severance accrual for one employee slated to be terminated but instead retained for another position 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million reflecting consolidation and abandonment of leased space and associated impairment of tenant improvements  severance costs  an asset impairment charge and the initiation of a program to sell excess manufacturing equipment resulting from the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  especially related to our fiber optics products 
in the third quarter of  we decided to abandon a portion of our leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess space  for which we had a remaining eight year commitment  is located on the first floor of our current corporate headquarters and originally housed a portion of our optics and integrated assemblies manufacturing operations 
this decision resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
in addition  our management made a decision during the third quarter of to exit the fiber optics business after current contractual obligations had been satisfied 
this decision resulted in a significant overcapacity of certain manufacturing equipment and we initiated a plan to sell this equipment before the end of the first quarter of our excess manufacturing equipment resulted in a total charge of million 
assets to be held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair market value was determined by obtaining an independent third party appraisal 
the majority of these impaired assets was sold in the fourth quarter of also during the third quarter of  our management identified manufacturing equipment exclusively supporting certain in warranty optics and fixed wireless products as well as manufacturing equipment supporting final orders for certain other optics and fixed wireless products and determined that the estimated future cash flows did not support the carrying value of these assets 
as such  the carrying value of these assets were written down to the estimated future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of these assets 
fair market value was determined by obtaining an independent third party appraisal 
this action resulted in a  asset impairment charge 
during  we incurred severance expense of approximately  related to a reduction of approximately employees 
also during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision in december to completely outsource our internal wafer fabrication 
as a result of the closure of our wafer fabrication facility  approximately of the company s workforce approximately employees will be eliminated  which will result in severance payments of approximately  the closure of this facility will result in additional excess space of approximately  square feet for which we will have a remaining two year commitment 
this decision has resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
this decision triggered an impairment analysis under sfas no 
recoverability of these assets were measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets over their remaining year of life 
as such  the carrying value of these assets were written down to the estimated future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of these assets  which was determined by obtaining an independent third party appraisal 
this action resulted in a million asset impairment charge 
for  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision to abandon an excess facility 
in september  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess facility  for which we had a ten year commitment  is located adjacent to our current corporate headquarters and was originally developed to house additional administrative and corporate offices to accommodate planned expansion 
this decision resulted in a pre tax lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and a pre tax asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
the restructuring charge also includes an additional charge for the leased facility we abandoned in based on our downward revised assumptions regarding sublease occupancy rates and market rates due to an overall deteriorating real estate market and difficulties subleasing our available space 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected off setting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of the current market conditions

on january   we completed a secondary offering whereby we sold  shares of common stock at per share resulting in gross proceeds of million 
pending use of the net proceeds  we have invested them in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities which will increase interest income 
this increase will be partially offset to the extent we continue to utilize our cash in the operation of our business

starting in the second quarter of  we were required to offer more favorable payment terms to significant customers in order to remain competitive in the current business environment

we expect this increase in our average payment terms to negatively impact our working capital

based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together with available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we will utilize our cash  cash flows and borrowings to the extent available and  if desirable or necessary  we may seek to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity 
there can be no assurances  however  that future borrowings and capital resources will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our cash flows are highly dependent on demand for our products  timing of orders and shipments with key customers and our ability to manage our working capital  especially inventory and accounts receivable  as well as controlling our production and operating costs in line with our revenue 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k

purchase obligations are orders for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services 
while the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service 
total does not include our reserves for income tax contingencies which are recorded on our consolidated balances sheets under other long term obligations 
our income tax reserves of approximately million relate to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities including our federal tax filings for to which are currently under examination 
this liability has been excluded from the above table as the timing of payments is uncertain 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents consist of municipal bond funds and commercial paper acquired with remaining maturity periods of days or less and are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates market value 
short term investments consist primarily of high grade debt securities a rating or better with maturity greater than days from the date of acquisition and are classified as available for sale 
short term investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  until realized 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise or fall in value if market interest rates change 
they are also subject to short term market risk 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio and constitutes a forward looking statement 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
expected maturity dates expected maturity amounts in thousands weighted average interest rate cash equivalents short term investments fair value at december
