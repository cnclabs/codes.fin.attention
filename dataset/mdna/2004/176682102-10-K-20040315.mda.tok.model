critical accounting policies 
the accounting and financial policies of the company and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices in the banking industry 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include the company s accounting for the allowance for loan losses 
the company s accounting policies relating to the allowance for loan losses involve the use of estimates and require significant judgments to be made by management 
these estimates are based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the company s existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on available information including the composition of the loan portfolio  historical loan losses  specific impaired loans  availability and quality of collateral  age of the various portfolios  changes in local economic conditions  and loan performance and quality of the portfolio 
different assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses could result in material changes in the company s consolidated financial condition or consolidated financial results of operations 
the company s policies with respect to the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about uncertain matters 
these critical policies and their assumptions are periodically reviewed with the board of directors 
comparison of financial condition for the years ended december   and december  total assets increased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  cash and cash equivalents was abnormally high at december   due to the receipt of million in net stock proceeds from the stock offering that was completed on september   which is described in the business section of item of this report 
the proceeds were primarily used to purchase investment and mortgage backed securities during  resulting in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increases in investment and mortgage backed securities 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  or  while investment securities increased by million  or  and mortgage backed securities increased by million  or 
management plans to reinvest the proceeds into higher yielding commercial and consumer loans as cash flows are generated from investments and mortgage backed securities through maturities and principal and interest payments 
management continues to emphasize the origination of shorter term commercial and consumer loans in order to reduce the company s vulnerability to rising interest rates 
during  these loans  which include construction loans  multifamily residential loans  nonresidential real estate loans  consumer loans  and commercial business loans  increased by million  or  to million at december  also during  the company s portfolio of one to four family residential loans decreased from million to million 
this decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the high level of mortgage loan refinancings during resulting from historically low interest rates 
the company originates and closes substantially all new fixed rate one to four family residential loans as a broker for an independent third party on a servicing released basis 
this generates additional fee income and reduces the potential adverse effects of rising interest rates on the company s future earnings that normally result from holding long term fixed rate loans 
as a result  total net outstanding loans decreased million  or  to million at december  also during  the company completed the construction of its tenth full service banking office in mooresville  north carolina  completed extensive renovations to upgrade its existing facilities in salisbury and rockwell  north carolina  and began construction of a new office in gastonia  north carolina that will replace an existing facility 
as a result  premises and equipment increased by million  or  to million 
the company currently plans to expand into belmont  north carolina and york county  south carolina within the next two years 
the company also purchased million in bank owned life insurance during this type of investment provides tax advantaged income with superior yields to other investment securities 
total liabilities increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due to an million increase in borrowed money and a million increase in deposits 
the increase in borrowed money was used to provide funds to purchase mortgage backed securities and to fund loans 
core deposits  which include demand deposits  money market demand accounts  and savings accounts  increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was offset by a million  or  decrease in higher costing certificates of deposit 
this change in the deposit portfolio composition reflects management s commitment to building new and enhancing existing customer relationships by focusing on a customer s primary financial needs such as checking accounts  savings accounts  and money market deposit accounts 
management plans to continue to aggressively market its retail and commercial deposit products to the local community and to increase the bank s core deposit market share through an expanding branch network 
total equity at december   decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million 
this decrease was primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million 
these shares were repurchased as a part of stock repurchase plans announced in march and october the plan announced in march provided for the repurchase of  shares of stock 
all of the shares authorized under this plan were repurchased by september the october repurchase plan provides for the repurchase of up to  shares of stock  or approximately of the outstanding shares 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares under the plan and had  shares remaining to be repurchased 
management plans to continue to repurchase shares of common stock in the company at prices that are considered to be attractive and in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders 
total equity also decreased in as a result of the payment of million in cash dividends  or per share  and a million decrease in accumulated net unrealized gains on investments available for sale 
these decreases were partly offset by million in net income and  in vesting of stock issued under the citizens south banking corporation recognition and retention plan which is described in more detail in note employee benefit plans under item of this report 
results of operations the following discussion relates to operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   as well as the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the net income of the company is heavily dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on loans  investment and mortgage backed securities  and interest bearing deposits in other banks  offset by the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  the earnings provided returns on average equity of in  compared to in  and returns on average assets of in  compared to in net interest income  the company s largest source of income  decreased by million  or  due in part to the decreasing spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities caused by the historically low interest rate environment 
the interest rate spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in  resulting in a decrease in the net interest margin from to during the same period 
the compression in the company s net interest margin reached its low point of during the third quarter of  and showed signs of considerable improvement in the fourth quarter of  reaching  an increase of basis points from the previous quarter 
management believes that continued improvement in the company s net interest margin and resulting net interest income will take place in  as interest rates have stabilized  prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities have slowed and loan demand has improved 
however  if interest rates continue to decline and or loan prepayments accelerate  management s expectations for may not be realized 
interest income for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily due to a million  or  reduction in interest income on loans 
during the year  average outstanding loans decreased by million  or  from million to million  while the average yield on loans decreased from to 
these changes were primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the prime lending rate in june  and an abnormally high level of loan prepayments and refinancings that reduced both yields and outstanding balances 
the reduction in average outstanding loans was primarily due to the fact that the bank originates and closes substantially all new fixed rate residential loans as a broker for an independent third party 
this reduces the bank s vulnerability to increases in interest rates 
the level of prepayments and refinancings slowed during the fourth quarter of as interest rates began to stabilize 
interest income on interest bearing bank deposits also decreased  with a reduction of  or 
average balances of interest bearing bank deposits decreased by million  or  to million 
this reduction was primarily due to the investment of the proceeds received in the stock offering see the business section of item for further discussion into higher yielding investment and mortgage backed securities 
also  the average yield on interest bearing bank deposits decreased to from to  as short term interest rates continued to decrease in interest earned on investment securities increased slightly to million 
the average balance of investment securities increased by million  or  to million  however  this increase was offset by a decrease in the yield from to 
interest earned on mortgage backed securities increased by million  or 
this increase was due to a million  or increase in average outstanding balances to million for the months ending december  these balances increased due to the investment in net proceeds received in the september stock offering see the business section of item for further discussion  the reinvestment of funds received from loan prepayments  and the investment of funds received from borrowed money 
the increase in average balances was partly offset in a decrease in the average yield from to 
management plans to reinvest the cash flows generated from these mortgage backed securities into new consumer and commercial loan originations 
interest expense for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million 
this decrease was due to a million  or  decrease in interest paid on deposits 
average interest bearing deposits decreased million  or  to million 
most of this decrease was attributable to a million decrease in higher costing certificates of deposit 
all other deposits  including demand deposits  money market demand accounts  and savings accounts  increased by million 
this change in the deposit mix reflects management s commitment to building new and enhancing existing customer relationships by focusing on a customer s primary financial needs such as checking accounts  savings accounts  and money market demand accounts 
average deposit balances decreased from to primarily as a result of the maturity of higher costing certificates of deposit acquired in the acquisition of innes street in december  which is detailed in the business section in item of this report 
actual year end deposit balances increased by million from to the average interest rate paid on deposits decreased from to due to lower market rates 
average borrowings increased by million  or  to million  while the rate paid on borrowings decreased from to due to lower market interest rates and the restructuring of million in federal home loan bank advances 
this restructuring reduced the average interest rate on these advances from to 
these changes resulted in minor reduction of interest paid on borrowings to million 
the company provided  and  in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was at both december   and december  the ratio of allowances to total loans has remained flat due to the stable ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans of at december   and at december  refer to the allowance for loan losses section of item of this report for further discussion 
for the year ended december   noninterest income increased by million  or  from million to million 
the primary reasons for the change were a  increase in fees on deposit accounts  a  increase in mortgage banking loan fee income  a  increase in gains on sale of assets  and a  increase in the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets 
the increase in fees on deposit accounts resulted from our continued emphasis on building our portfolio of fee generating demand deposit accounts and a competitive fee structure on deposit products 
mortgage banking loan fee income increased due to a higher number of loan originations resulting  in part  from lower interest rates 
we originated and closed many of these residential loans as a broker for a third party  resulting in immediate fee income for the bank 
the demand for residential loans  and subsequent fee income derived from originating such loans  may decrease if interest rates begin to rise 
the increase in the fair value adjustment on investments associated with deferred compensation assets totaled  which was offset by a corresponding  adjustment to compensation expense  resulting in no net impact on net income 
during the year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities at a net gain of million 
these gains were used to offset the impact of vesting a portion of the common stock granted in the citizens south banking corporation recognition and retention plan  which is described in note employee benefit plans under item of this report 
during the fiscal year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities  million in mortgage backed securities  and million of residential loans at a gain of  noninterest expense increased by million  or  from million in to million in the primary reasons for the increase were a million increase in compensation  a million prepayment penalty on fhlb advances  a  increase in professional services  a  increase in telephone expense  and a  increase in other noninterest expenses 
compensation increased due in part to the vesting of a portion of the common stock granted in the citizens south banking corporation recognition and retention plan  the opening of the company s tenth full service office  and fair value adjustments made on deferred compensation plans 
these fair value adjustments totaled  in and are offset by a corresponding  adjustment to other noninterest income  resulting in no net impact on net income 
during  we recognized a million pre tax prepayment penalty associated with the restructuring of million in borrowed funds 
this action was taken by the company in an effort to capitalize on historically low interest rates  lower the company s cost of funds  and improve the company s net interest margin 
this restructuring reduced the average interest rate paid on these borrowed funds from to  resulting in an immediate reduction in interest expense of  per quarter for the first year 
the reduction in interest expense is expected to amount to approximately million over the next five years 
professional services increased by  or  during due  in part  to additional outside services being needed to ensure proper corporate governance in light of new regulatory requirements 
telephone expense increased by  or  due partly to the opening of a new branch office and enhanced data communications service at the existing bank offices 
other noninterest expense increased by  or due  in part  to franchise tax payments to the state of delaware and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
these increases in noninterest expenses were partially offset by a  or  reduction in the amortization of the core deposit intangible 
the core deposit intangible was created as a result of the acquisition of innes street in  which is described in the business section of item of this report 
it is being amortized over a seven year period on an accelerated basis 
the unamortized balance of the core deposit intangible as of december   was million 
the company also experienced decreased expenses associated with data processing expenses  office supplies and advertising totaling  or

due to this acquisition  average interest earning assets increased million to million  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million to million 
in addition  the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in the increase in interest earning assets  net of interest bearing liabilities  coupled with the increase in the interest rate spread resulted in the million increase in net interest income

for the year ended december   noninterest income increased by million  or  from million to million

the average life of a loan is substantially less than its contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates 
nonperforming assets and delinquencies 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  we attempt to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower and collecting the payment 
computer generated late notices are mailed days after a payment is due 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if a delinquency continues  additional contact is made either through a notice or other means and we will attempt to work out a payment schedule and actively encourage delinquent residential mortgage borrowers to seek home ownership counseling 
while we generally prefer to work with borrowers to resolve such problems  we will institute foreclosure or other proceedings  as necessary  to minimize any potential loss 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status generally if  in the opinion of management  principal or interest payments are not likely in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement  or when principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest accrued but not collected at the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against income in the current period 
loans may be reinstated to accrual status when payments are under days past due and  in the opinion of management  collection of the remaining past due balances can be reasonably expected 
our board of directors is informed monthly of the total amount of loans which are more than days delinquent 
loans that are more than days delinquent or in foreclosure are reviewed by the board on an individual basis each month 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated

real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate acquired in settlement of loans until sold 
generally  foreclosed assets are held for sale and such assets are carried at the lower of cost or market value minus estimated cost to sell the property 
after the date of acquisition  all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed and costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property are capitalized up to the extent of their net realizable value 
at december   we had  in real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this balance is comprised of one single family residence located in the bank s normal lending area 
this property was acquired in and is listed for sale with a local real estate broker 
restructured loans 
under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructuring as a troubled debt restructuring 
in general  the modification or restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring if we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrowers that we would not otherwise consider 
debt restructurings or loan modifications for a borrower do not necessarily always constitute troubled debt restructurings  however  and troubled debt restructurings do not necessarily result in nonaccrual loans 
we had no restructured loans as of december  asset classification 
the ots has adopted various regulations regarding problem assets of financial institutions 
the regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  ots examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  we establish specific allowances for loan losses for the full amount of the portion of the asset classified as loss 
all or a portion of general loan loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful can be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital  while specific valuation allowances for loan losses generally do not qualify as regulatory capital 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated special mention and monitored by us 
as of december   we had million in assets classified substandard   classified doubtful  and no assets classified as loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention as of december   was million 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting atandards sfas no 
 management determined that impaired loans were not material as of december as of december   we had million classified as substandard   classified as doubtful and no assets classified as loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention was million 
pursuant to sfas  management determined that impaired loans were not material as of december  allowance for loan losses management has established a systematic methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and considers all loans in the portfolio 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired under sfas the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  the term of the loan  general economic conditions  and in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectibility 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million 
management believes that this amount meets the requirement for losses on loans that management considers to be impaired  for known losses  and for risks inherent in the remaining loan portfolios 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to periodic evaluation by various regulatory authorities and may be subject to adjustment upon their examination

   deposits our deposit products include a broad selection of deposit instruments  including checking accounts  money market deposit accounts  savings accounts  individual retirement accounts  and term certificate accounts 
we offer these products to both retail and commercial customers 
deposit account terms vary with the principal difference being the minimum balance deposit  early withdrawal penalties and the interest rate 
we review our deposit mix and pricing weekly 
we do not utilize brokered deposits  nor have we aggressively sought jumbo certificates of deposit 
we believe that we are competitive in the type of accounts and interest rates we offer on our deposit products 
we do not seek to pay the highest deposit rates  but a competitive rate 
management determines the rates paid based on a number of conditions  including rates paid by competitors  rates on us treasury securities  rates offered on alternative lending programs  and the deposit growth rate we are seeking to achieve

at december   citizens south bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements 
under prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank s capital well capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  adequately capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  significantly undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  and critically undercapitalized less than tangible capital 
at december   citizens south bank met the criteria for being considered well capitalized 
funding for future growth is dependent upon the earnings of the company and its subsidiaries 
at december   the company had a capital to assets ratio of 
as such  the company fully expects to be able to meet future capital needs caused by growth and expansion as well as regulatory requirements 
a primary reason for the company s strong capital position was the successful stock offering that was completed in september that raised net proceeds of million as discussed in the business section of item of this report 
the company plans to continue to repurchase its common stock in the open market from time to time as market conditions warrant 
during  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million 
liquidity the objectives of the company s liquidity management policy include providing adequate funds to meet the cash needs of both borrowers and depositors  to provide for the on going operations of the company  and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses the company s ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable  increases in local deposits  cash flows generated from operations  and cash flows generated by investments 
if the company requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities  it may rely upon external sources of funds such in brokered deposits and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
the company has million in additional advances available from its line of credit from the fhlb and an additional million line of credit with another financial institution 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and we are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets principally securities that are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the us government provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met 
advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit 
the company may also solicit brokered deposits for providing funds for asset growth  however  to date  the company has not used such deposits to supplement its liquidity position 
in the normal course of business  various commitments are outstanding that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit and undisbursed advances on customer lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
the funding of these commitments and previously approved undisbursed lines of credit could effect the company s liquidity position 
at december   the company had loan commitments excluding undisbursed portions of construction loans of million of million and unused lines of credit of million 
the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund loan commitments and lines of credit as they arise 
the company does not have any special purpose entities of other similar forms of off balance sheet financing 
under existing contractual obligations  the company will be required to make payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about payments due under such contractual obligations at december  the company expects that a portion of the deposits will not be renewed upon maturity 
if there is a higher than normal level of time deposits that are not renewed at maturity  then the company may experience a decrease in liquidity 
this may result in the company offering higher than market interest rates to maintain deposits  which would increase interest expense 
transaction deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities have been classified as having payments due in one year or less

     deposits     lease obligations total      market risks market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market price and interest risks 
the risk of loss can be reflected in diminished market values and or reduced net interest income in future periods 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  as the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the structure of the company s loan and deposit portfolios is such that significant declines in interest rates could adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
the company does not maintain a trading account  nor is it subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for monitoring and managing exposure to interest rate risk  as discussed below in interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity the company s alco monitors the company s level of interest rate sensitivity and ensures that the level of sensitivity of the company s net portfolio value is maintained within limits established by the board of directors 
through such management  the alco seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
during the past year  the alco utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of short term commercial business loans and nonresidential mortgage loans  emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate home equity lines of credit  emphasizing the origination and retention of one to four family residential adjustable rate mortgage loans  originating all new fixed rate mortgage loans as a broker for a third party  and investing in shorter term investment securities 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of the bank s cash flow from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items the bank s net portfolio value or npv and the net interest income nii of the bank would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
these computations estimate the effect on a bank s npv and nii from instantaneous and permanent one hundred to three hundred basis point increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the following table presents the bank s projected change in npv and nii at december   as calculated by an independent third party  based upon information provided by the bank 
the bank s level of sensitivity  given a hypothetical  immediate  and sustained change in interest rates from basis points to basis points  is within the range of acceptable sensitivity established by the board of directors 
table interest rate sensitivity estimated theoretical estimated theoretical hypothetical  immediate  net interest income net portfolio value and sustained changes in interest rates amount change amount change dollars in thousands basis point rise   basis point rise   basis point rise   no change   basis point decline   basis point decline   basis point decline   certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effect of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services
