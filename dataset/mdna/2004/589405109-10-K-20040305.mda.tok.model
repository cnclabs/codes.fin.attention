overview mercury is the leading provider of software and services for the business technology optimization bto marketplace 
bto is a business strategy for aligning it and business goals while optimizing the quality  performance  and business availability of strategic software applications and systems 
our application delivery  application management and it governance products and services  and the mercury optimization centers are designed to help our customers increase the business value of it with bto 
we have aligned our enterprise software business model with the way we believe customers want to license and deploy enterprise software today 
customers are moving away from the rigidity of perpetual software licenses to flexible term or subscription based contracts 
customers have the choice between running software in house or having software delivered as a hosted or managed service 
mercury s enterprise software business model enables our customers to license the right software  for the right period of time  and have it deployed the right way while giving mercury the right financial incentives to renew and expand our relationships with customers 
we believe that the success of our model can be seen in our financial results which include significant growth in revenue and deferred revenue 
in order to understand our financial results  it is important to understand our changing business model and its impact on the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated balance sheet 
we continue to experience a dramatic increase in the amount of software licenses structured as term or subscription based contracts 
the majority of these types of contracts are required to be recorded initially as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and then recognized in subsequent periods over the term of the contract as subscription revenue in our consolidated income statement see below under business model 
therefore  to understand the full growth of our business  one must look at both revenue and the change in deferred revenue 
business model revenue consists of fees for the license and subscription of our software products  maintenance fees  and professional service fees 
license revenue is comprised of license fees charged for the use of our products under perpetual or multiple year arrangements in which the fair value of the license fee is separately determinable from maintenance and or professional services 
subscription revenue  including managed service revenue  represents license fees to use one or more software products  and to receive maintenance support such as hotline support and updates for a limited period of time 
since subscription licenses include bundled products and services  for which the fair value of the license fee is not separately determinable from maintenance  both product and service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term 
maintenance revenue is comprised of fees charged for post contract customer support  which are determinable based upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts  and in the absence of stated renewal rates upon separate sales of renewals to other customers 
professional service revenue is comprised of fees charged for product training and consulting services  which are determinable based upon separate sales of these services to other customers by us 

table of contents due to the different treatment of subscription and perpetual licenses under applicable accounting rules  each type of license has a different impact on our consolidated financial statements 
when a customer buys a subscription license  the majority of the revenue will be recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
the amount recorded as deferred revenue is equal to the portion of the license fee that has been invoiced or paid but not recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue is reduced as revenue is recognized 
under perpetual licenses and some multi year arrangements for which separate vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements  a higher proportion of all license revenue is recognized in the quarter that the product is delivered  with a lesser proportion recorded as deferred revenue 
therefore  an order for a subscription license will result in significantly lower current period revenue than an equal sized order under a perpetual license 
conversely  an order for a subscription license will result in higher revenues recognized in future periods than an equal sized order for a perpetual license 
our license revenue in any given quarter is dependent upon the volume of perpetual license orders delivered during the quarter and the amount of subscription revenue amortized from deferred revenue and  to a small degree  revenue recognized on subscription orders received during the quarter 
we set our revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain level of orders and a certain mix of perpetual licenses and subscription licenses 
the precise mix of orders is subject to substantial fluctuation in any given quarter or multiple quarter periods  and the actual mix of licenses sold affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we achieve the target level of total orders but are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets if we deliver more than expected subscription licenses or may exceed them if we deliver more than expected perpetual licenses 
our ability to achieve our revenue targets is also impacted by the mix of domestic and international sales  together with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
for the year ended december   our revenues were affected favorably by a weakening of the us dollars relative to other currencies  primarily the euro and british pound 
total revenues from international sales for fiscal was million  an increase of million  compared to fiscal million of this increase was due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if there is a decrease in value of foreign currencies  our revenues from international sales would be negatively impacted 
if we achieve the target license mix but the overall level of orders is below the target level  then we may not meet our revenue targets 
in  we changed the mix of software license types to a higher percentage of subscription licenses 
we believe that this shift will continue in the future as we offer more products on a subscription basis and more customers license our products on a subscription basis 
this shift may cause us to experience a decrease in recognized revenue  as well as continued growth of deferred revenue 
cost of license and subscription includes direct costs to produce and distribute our products  such as costs of materials  product packaging and shipping  equipment depreciation  and production personnel  and costs associated with our managed services business  including personnel related costs  fees to providers of internet bandwidth and related infrastructure  and depreciation expense of managed services equipment 
cost of maintenance includes direct costs of providing product customer support  largely consisting of personnel costs and related expenses  and the cost of providing upgrades to our subscription customers 
we have not broken out the costs associated with subscriptions because these costs cannot be separated between license and subscription cost of revenue 
cost of professional services includes direct costs of providing product training and consulting  largely consisting of personnel costs and related expenses 
license and subscription  maintenance  and professional services costs also include allocated facility and information technology infrastructure expenses 
the costs associated with subscription licenses  which include the cost of products and services  are expensed as incurred over the subscription term 
in addition  we defer the portion of our commission expense related to subscription licenses and amortize the expense over the subscription term

facilities impairment in july  the board of directors approved a plan to lease a new headquarter facility and to sell the existing buildings in our sunnyvale headquarters 
during september  we signed a letter of intent to lease four buildings and material terms of the lease were finalized in the same month 
the lease agreement was signed in october as a result of our decision to move to a new headquarter facility and to sell the buildings we vacated and plan to vacate  we performed an impairment analysis of the four buildings that comprise our sunnyvale headquarters 
in september  we wrote down the net book value of our two existing vacant buildings to million  which approximated their appraised market value after taking into account the cost to 
table of contents maintain these facilities until sold and sales commissions related to the sale of the buildings 
accordingly  we reclassified these two buildings as assets held for sale 
assets held for sale are included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the impairment charge of million associated with the write down is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  on january   the two vacant buildings were sold at the carrying value to a third party for million in cash 
we are currently using the remaining two buildings as our new headquarter facility is not available for us to occupy until the second quarter of fiscal we have not recorded any impairment charges related to these buildings

net loss on investments in non consolidated companies net loss on investments in non consolidated companies was million for the year ended december   or of total revenues  compared to million for the year ended december   or of total revenues 
for the year ended december   we recorded losses of million on three of our investments in early stage private companies and a loss of million on our investment in a private equity fund 
these losses were partially offset by an unrealized gain of million related to a change in fair value of a warrant to purchase common stock of motive  inc for the year ended december   we recorded losses of million on three of our investments in early stage private companies 
the fair value of the motive warrant was calculated by using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and stock price of the company

provision for income taxes historically  our operations resulted in a significant amount of income in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investments 
the tax holidays and rate reductions  which we will be able to realize under programs currently in effect  expire at various dates through future provisions for taxes will depend upon the mix of worldwide income and the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december    and differ from statutory tax rates principally because of our participation in taxation programs in israel 
we intend to continue to increase our investment in our israeli operations consistent with our overall tax strategy 
other factors that cause the effective tax rate and statutory tax rates to differ include the non deductibility of charges for amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation  and in process research and development 
us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings for certain non us subsidiaries 
we intend to invest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us 
table of contents in  we sold the economic rights of freshwater s intellectual property to our israeli subsidiary 
as a result of this intellectual property sale  we have recorded a current tax payable and a prepaid tax asset in the amount of million  which is being amortized to income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations over eight years  which approximates the period over which the expected benefit is expected to be realized 
we intend to migrate the economic ownership of the technology acquired from performant and kintana to our israeli subsidiary in fiscal  which may lead to a temporary increase in the effective tax rate 
at december   we have a prepaid tax asset of million included in prepaid expenses and other assets and million included in other assets  net in our consolidated balance sheet

the increase in cash and investments from december  was primarily due to positive cash generated from operations  issuance of our notes  and cash received from issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  partially offset by cash used in capital expenditures and acquisitions of business and technology 
during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operating activities  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in cash from operations during fiscal  compared to fiscal  was due primarily to a larger increase in the deferred revenue balance as we continue to offer more products on a subscription basis and more customers license our products on a subscription basis 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities  compared to million cash provided by our investing activities in the year ended december  the increase in cash used in our investing activities was partially related to net cash used in the acquisitions of performant for million  kintana for million  and allerez technology for million 
the acquisitions of performant and kintana expand our product lines offered to our customers and technology acquired from allerez extends the functionality of our application delivery and application management products 
cash was also used in the purchase of investments for million  and capital expenditures of million to support our expanded business 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction of equity investments in non consolidated companies and no additional restricted cash was required to be delivered under our interest rate swap with gscm  as was required in fiscal during the year ended december   cash proceeds from our financing activities were million  compared to cash used in our financing activities of million in the year ended december  the increase in cash proceeds from our financing activities was primarily due to issuance of our notes in april  an increase in issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans  collection of notes receivable from issuance of common stock  and no retirement of our notes in fiscal cash proceeds from issuance of the notes  net of issuance costs of million  was million 
in june  we entered into a non exclusive agreement to license technology from motive 
the agreement is non transferable  except in the case of a merger  acquisition  spin out  or other transfer of all or substantially all of the business  stock or assets to which the agreement relates 
the licensed technology will be combined with our other existing products  which should be generally available within twelve months from the effective date of this agreement 
the agreement was originally in effect until december  with an election to renew and an option to purchase a fully paid up  perpetual license to the technology prior to july  in february  the agreement was extended to december  in accordance with the addendum  we will pay an additional million to motive for an additional month maintenance and support service for the year ending december  the fee is due on december  in addition  the addendum accelerated the payment of 
table of contents the remaining royalty balance of million 
under the original agreement  we had committed to royalty payments totaling million  of which million had been paid as of december  the remaining balance of million was paid in february as of december   we are committed to make additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million 
as of december   we had four irrevocable letter of credit agreements totaling million with wells fargo company wells fargo in conjunction with our facility leases 
wells fargo is a related party of mercury as one of the members of our board of directors is an executive officer of wells fargo 
these agreements are primarily related to facility leases assumed by us in conjunction with the acquisitions of kintana and freshwater and the facility lease for our new headquarters in mountain view  california 
two of the agreements have automatic annual renewal provisions under which the expiration dates cannot be extended beyond march  and august  the agreement for the facility lease of our new headquarters automatically renews annually after january  unless mercury provides a termination notice to wells fargo 
the fourth agreement expires in september as of december   no letters of credit were drawn 
we lease facilities for sales offices in the us and foreign locations under non cancelable operating leases that expire through certain of these leases contain renewal options 
in addition  we lease certain equipment under various leases with lease terms ranging from month to month up to one year 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations at december  are as follows in thousands zero coupon senior convertible notes due notes convertible subordinated notes due notes a non cancelable operating leases royalty agreements total thereafter total a assuming we do not retire additional notes during and interest rates stay consistent  we will make interest payments net of our interest rate swap of approximately million during each of   and  and approximately million during the face value of our notes differs from our book value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of our long term debt activities and related accounting policies 
in july  we issued million in subordinated convertible notes due on july  the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and are payable semiannually on january and july of each year 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our future senior debt 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes will become due and payable at maturity 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after july  accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by us in any such redemption 
from december through june   we retired million face value of the notes 

table of contents in april  in a private offering we issued million of zero coupon convertible notes due on may  the notes do not bear interest  have a zero yield to maturity and may be convertible into our common stock 
holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to maturity only if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds or if specified corporate transactions have occurred 
upon conversion  we have the right to deliver cash instead of shares of our common stock 
we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the conversion provisions for the notes 
historically  a significant amount of our income and cash flow was generated in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment 
we may have to pay significantly more income taxes if these tax rate incentives are not renewed upon expiration or tax rates applicable to us are increased or if we choose to repatriate cash balances from israel to other foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  our future tax provisions will depend on the mix of our worldwide income and the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions 
as of december   we did not have any purchase commitments other than obligations incurred in the normal course of business 
these amounts are accrued when services or goods are received 
for the years ended december    and  our source of funding was mainly from cash generated by our operations and from the issuance of convertible notes 
since our operating results may fluctuate significantly  a decrease in customer demand or a decrease in the acceptance of our future products and services may impact our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations 
in  we changed the mix of software license types to a higher percentage of subscription licenses 
the amount of application delivery products licensed on a subscription basis continues to increase since the change in in addition  we continue to derive a substantial portion of our overall business growth through the growth of our application management product offerings which are primarily offered on a subscription basis 
this shift in the mix of license types does not impact our collections cycle as we typically invoice the customers up front for the full license amount and cash is generally received within days from the invoice date in the us slightly longer in emea 
our quarterly operating results are affected by the mix of license types entered into in connection with the sale of products 
as revenue associated with our subscription licenses is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license  the shift in mix will also result in deferred revenue becoming a larger component of our cash provided by operations 
we believe that the shift to a subscription revenue model will continue in the future as we offer more products on a subscription basis and as more of our customers license our products on a subscription basis 
this shift may cause us to experience a decrease or a lower rate of growth in recognized revenue  as well as continued growth in deferred revenue 
deferred revenue as of december  was million compared to million as of december   primarily due to an increase in subscription licenses 
in the future  we expect cash will continue to be generated from our operations 
we expect to spend additional cash of approximately million on leasehold improvements and it infrastructure for our new leased campus  and other related costs during fiscal we do not expect the level of cash used in investing activities to acquire property and equipment in to change significantly from fiscal in february  we purchased approximately  square feet of land for million near our existing offices in israel  which will be used for our research and development activities there 
we currently plan to reinvest our cash generated from operations in new short and long term investments in high quality financial  government  and corporate securities or other investments  consistent with past investment practices  and therefore net cash used in investing activities may increase 
cash could be used in the future to invest in acquisitions  strategic investments  or repurchase additional debt or equity 
there are no transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with non consolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources 
assuming there is no significant change in our business  we believe that our current cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents critical accounting policies the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  valuation of long lived assets and other intangible assets  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  accounting for investments in non consolidated companies  accounting for stock options  and estimating of forward contract terms 
we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other key accounting policies 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have made significant judgments related to revenue recognition  specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our arrangements  we must evaluate whether our fee is fixed or determinable and we must assess whether collectibility is probable 
these judgments are discussed below 
fee is fixed or determinable with respect to each arrangement  we must make a judgment as to whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
if the fee is fixed or determinable  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of software or over the period of arrangements with our customers assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue recognized in each quarter subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria will be the lesser of the aggregate of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees had been fixed or determinable 
a determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable also depends upon the payment terms relating to such an arrangement 
our customary payment terms are generally within days of the invoice date  depending upon the region 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond the customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable 
a determination of whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable is particularly relevant to revenue recognition on perpetual licenses 
the amount and timing of our revenue recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments 
collectibility is probable in order to recognize revenue  we must make a judgment of the collectibility of the arrangement fee 
our judgment of the collectibility is applied on a customer by customer basis 
we generally sell to customers for 
table of contents which there is a history of successful collection 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
use of estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the sales reserve and prepaid commissions 
we must make estimates of potential future credits  warranty cost of product and services  and write off of bad debts related to current period product revenues 
we analyze historical returns  historical bad debts  current economic trends  average deal size  and changes in customer demand  and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales reserves 
revenue for the period is reduced to reflect the sales reserve provision 
as a percentage of current period revenues  charges against sales reserves were insignificant in the years ended december    and significant management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing the sales reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if we make different judgments or use different estimates 
at december  and  the provisions for sales reserves were million and million  respectively 
we are required to make estimates of the future sales commission expense associated with our revenues that will be recognized in future periods 
we analyze historical commission rates  composition of the future revenues and expected timing of revenue recognition of such future amounts 
we make significant judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the prepaid commission in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our sales commission expense for any period if we make different judgments or use different estimates 
at december  and  prepaid commissions were million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets and other intangible assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

table of contents we determine the recoverability of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
such estimation process is highly subjective and involves significant management judgment 
determination of impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with our two vacant headquarters buildings 
during the years ended december  and  we did not record any impairment charges on long lived assets or certain intangible assets 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on long lived assets and certain intangible assets to reduce the carrying amount of these assets 
net intangible assets and long lived assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  and potentially more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure this impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow 
we completed the preliminary assessment during the first quarter of and performed an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter in both and we did not record an impairment charge based on our reviews 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charge on goodwill to reduce its carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  upon further review of sfas no 
 we reclassified million of net intangible assets to goodwill 
we had previously amortized goodwill of million associated with these intangible assets in each of the first three quarters of we did not amortize this amount during the fourth quarter of and have ceased amortization associated with these intangible assets 
goodwill was million and million at december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in addition  to the extent that we are unable to continue to reinvest a substantial portion of our profits in our israeli operations  we may be subject to additional tax rate increases in the future 
our taxes could increase if these tax rate incentives are not renewed upon expiration  tax rates applicable to us are increased  authorities challenge our tax strategy  or our tax strategy is impacted by new laws or rulings 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the entire portion of the net operating losses related to the income tax benefits arising from the exercise of employees stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for investments in non consolidated companies from time to time  we make investments in early stage private companies and private equity funds for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies operations 
we periodically monitor our investments for impairment and will record reductions in carrying values if and when necessary 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies and private equity funds 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
as part of this evaluation process  our review includes  but is not limited to  a review of each company s cash position  recent financing activities  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
if we determine that the carrying value of an investment is at an amount above fair value  or if a company has completed a financing based on a valuation significantly lower than the carrying value of our investment and the decline is other than temporary  it is our policy to record an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
at december   our investments in non consolidated companies was million 
our investments in early stage private companies and a private equity fund were million 
we have committed to make capital contributions to this private equity fund for million 
as of december   our total capital contributions to this private equity fund were million 
our investments also include the fair value of a warrant to purchase common stock of motive was million 
if the companies in which we have made investments do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies  we may not be able to sell these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments  we cannot assure that we will be able to sell them at a gain or even recover our investment 
the potential decline in the nasdaq national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on many of these investments 
for the year ended december   we recorded losses of million  million  and million on three of our investments in early stage private companies and a loss of million on our investment in the private equity fund 
for the year ended december   we recorded losses of million  million  and million on three of our investments in early stage private companies 
for the year ended december   we did not record any losses on our investments in early stage private companies and the private equity fund 
in calculating the loss to be recorded  we took into account the latest valuation of each of the portfolio companies based on recent sales of equity securities to outside third party investors 
we hold a warrant to purchase common stock of motive 
the warrant is treated as a derivative instrument due to a net settlement provision 
the warrant is recorded at its fair value on each reporting period 
we calculate the fair value of the warrant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions such as the expected stock price volatility and stock price 
in determining the stock price volatility  we consider volatility rates of other publicly trade companies in the same industry with comparable revenues 
we also take into account the latest option grant price when determining the stock price for the option pricing assumptions 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments issued by a private company requires management judgment and may contribute to volatility in our reported results of operations 

table of contents accounting for stock options we account for stock based compensation for our employees using the intrinsic value method presented in accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and comply with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure amendment of sfas no 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  as of the date of the grant  between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price 
no stock based compensation was recorded for stock options granted to our employees because we have granted stock options to our employees equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
in and  we recorded unearned stock based compensation primarily due to assumed stock options in conjunction with our acquisitions of freshwater  performant  and kintana 
we amortize unearned stock based compensation using the straight line method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options 
if we amortize unearned stock based compensation using the graded vesting method  which results in higher expense being recognized in the earlier period  our financial position and results of operations could be different 
in the annual meeting of the stockholders held in may  a proposal requesting our board of directors establish a policy of expensing stock options was put on the ballot by one of our stockholders 
the stockholders voted for the proposal and our board of directors is currently reviewing this matter 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently conducting a project on the accounting for equity based compensation 
if the current project becomes final  companies will be required to value employee stock options and stock issued under employee stock purchase plans using the fair value method on the grant date and record stock based compensation expense accordingly 
the fair value models that companies are allowed to use could be different from the black scholes option pricing model  which is currently used by us to calculate the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied sfas to employee option grants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the disclosure of the pro forma net income and earnings per share for the years ended december    and if we had applied sfas however  the actual impact to our results of operations upon adoption of the potential new accounting rule could be materially different from the pro forma information included in note to our consolidated financial statements due to differences in the option pricing model used  estimates and assumptions required  and options to be included in the calculation upon adoption 
the fair value models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock options 
we will closely monitor the development of this project and will evaluate the impact to our financial position and results of operations at such time that final rules are issued 
estimating of forward contract terms to mitigate our exposure on foreign currencies fluctuations  we have entered into forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated deferred revenues and receivables due from certain americas  emea  apac  and japan subsidiaries and foreign branches against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we enter into forward contracts based on our estimation of when revenue will be earned and cash will be collected 
if the timing between when revenue is earned and cash is collected is different from our estimates  we will recognize gains or losses on forward contracts as a result of our hedging ineffectiveness 
based on any gains and losses our financial position and results of operations may be significantly impacted

will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  you should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to invest in us or maintain or increase your investment 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem not significant may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our future success may be impaired and our operating results will suffer if we cannot respond to rapid market and technological changes by introducing new products and services and continually improving the performance  features  and reliability of our existing products and services and responding to competitive offerings 
the market for our software products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent introduction of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services by our competitors  increasing complexity and interdependence of our applications  changes in industry standards and practices  ability to attract and retain key personnel  and changes in customer requirements and demands 
to maintain our competitive position  we must continue to enhance our existing products  like our software products and services for our application management and application delivery  and it governance solutions 
we must also continue to develop new products and services  functionality  and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers 
the development of new products and services  and enhancement of existing products and services  entail significant technical and business risks and require substantial lead time and significant investments in product development 
in addition  many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal 
if we fail to anticipate new technology developments  customer requirements or industry standards  or if we are unable to develop new products and services that adequately address these new developments  requirements  and standards in a timely manner  our products and services may become obsolete  our ability to compete may be impaired  our revenue would decline  and our operating results would suffer 
we expect our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate  and it is difficult to predict our future revenue and operating results 
our revenue and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including fluctuations in demand for  and sales of  our products and services  
table of contents our success in developing and introducing new products and services and the timing of new product and service introductions  our ability to introduce enhancements to our existing products and services in a timely manner  changes in economic conditions affecting our customers or our industry  changes in the mix of products or services sold in a quarter  changes in the mix of perpetual  term  or subscription licenses sold in a quarter  fluctuations in the number of large orders in a quarter  uncertainties related to the integration of products  services  employees  and operations of acquired companies  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by our competitors and changes in the pricing policies of these competitors  the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles and changes in their budgets for software and related purchases  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business  deferrals by our customers of orders in anticipation of new products or services or product enhancements  and the mix of our domestic and international sales  together with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of our software product revenues is difficult to predict and can vary substantially from product to product and customer to customer 
we base our operating expenses on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
the timing of larger orders and customer buying patterns are difficult to forecast  therefore we may not learn of shortfalls in revenue or earnings or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a particular quarter 
as a result  if total revenues for a particular quarter are below our expectations  we would not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
we have experienced seasonality in our orders and revenues which may result in seasonality in our earnings 
the fourth quarter of the year typically has the highest orders and revenues for the year and higher orders and revenues than the first quarter of the following year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from the budgeting cycles of our customers being typically higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters  from our application management business being typically strongest in the fourth fiscal quarter and weakest in the first fiscal quarter  and to a lesser extent  from the structure of our sales commission program 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
if our operating results are below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the trading prices of our securities could decline 
our revenue targets are dependent on a projected mix of orders in a particular quarter and any failure to achieve revenue targets because of a shift in the mix of orders could adversely affect our quarterly revenue and operating results 
our license revenue in any given quarter is dependent upon the volume of perpetual orders shipped during the quarter and the amount of subscription revenue amortized from deferred revenue and  to a small degree  the amount recognized on subscription orders received during the quarter 
we set our revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain level of orders and a certain license mix of perpetual licenses and subscription licenses 
the precise mix of orders is subject to 
table of contents substantial fluctuation in any given quarter or multiple quarter periods  and the actual mix of licenses sold affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we achieve the target level of total orders but are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets if we deliver more than expected subscription licenses or may exceed them if we deliver more than expected perpetual licenses 
in addition  if we achieve the target license mix but the overall level of orders is below the target level  then we will not meet our revenue targets which will adversely affect our operating results 
in  we began to effect a change in the mix of software license types to a higher percentage of subscription licenses in our application management and application delivery products 
we believe that this shift will continue in the future as we offer more products on a subscription basis and more of our customers license our products on a subscription basis 
this shift may cause us to experience a decrease in recognized revenue  as well as continued growth of deferred revenue 
in addition  while subscription licenses represent a potential source of renewable license revenue  there is also the risk that customers will not renew their licenses at the end of a term 
economic  political  and market conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services 
our customers decisions to purchase our products and services are discretionary and subject to their internal budgets and purchasing processes 
we believe that the slowdown in the economy and the weakening of business conditions have caused and may continue to cause customers to reassess their immediate technology needs  lengthen their purchasing decision making processes  require more senior level internal approvals of purchases  and defer purchasing decisions  and accordingly  have reduced and could reduce demand in the future for our products and services 
in addition  the war on terrorism and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world have caused political uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets 
under these circumstances  there is a risk that our existing and potential customers may decrease spending for our products and services 
if demand for our products and services is reduced  our revenue growth rates and operating results will be adversely affected 
we expect to face increasing competition in the future  which could cause reduced sales levels and result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  or loss of market share 
the market for our business technology optimization products and services is extremely competitive  dynamic  and subject to frequent technological change 
there are few substantial barriers of entry in our market 
the internet has further reduced these barriers of entry  allowing other companies to compete with us in our markets 
as a result of the increased competition  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to identify and respond to the needs of current and potential customers  and to new technological and market opportunities  before our competitors identify and respond to these needs and opportunities 
we may fail to respond quickly enough to these needs and opportunities 
in the market for application delivery solutions  our principal competitors include compuware  empirix  ibm software group  and segue software 
in the new and rapidly changing market for application management solutions  our principal competitors include established providers of systems and network management software such as bmc software  computer associates  hp openview a division of hewlett packard  and tivoli a division of ibm  and providers of managed services such as keynote systems 
additionally  we face potential competition in this market from existing providers of application delivery solutions such as segue software and compuware 
in the market of it governance solutions  our principal competitors include enterprise application vendors such as sap  peoplesoft  oracle  and lawson  as well as point tool vendors such as primavera and niku 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market are price and cost effectiveness  product functionality  product performance  including scalability and reliability  quality of support and service  company reputation  depth and breadth of bto offerings  
table of contents r d leadership  financial stability  and global capabilities 
although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to these factors  the markets for application management  application delivery  and it governance are new and rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position  which could lead to a decrease in our revenues and adversely affect our operating results 
the software industry is increasingly experiencing consolidation and this could increase the resources available to our competitors and the scope of their product offerings 
for example  our former application delivery competitor rational software was acquired by ibm software group  which has substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop more advanced technology  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  or make more attractive offers to distribution partners and to employees 
if we fail to maintain our existing distribution channels and develop additional channels in the future  our revenue could decline 
we derive a portion of our business from sales of our products and services through distribution channels  such as global software vendors  systems integrators  or value added resellers 
we generally expect that sales of our products through these channels will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we may not experience increased revenue from new channels and may see a decrease from our existing channels  which could harm our business 
the loss of one or more of our systems integrators or value added resellers  or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products and services could result in reductions in our revenue in future periods 
in addition  our ability to increase our revenue in the future depends on our ability to expand our indirect distribution channels 
our dependence on indirect distribution channels presents a number of risks  including each of our global software vendors  systems integrators or value added resellers can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  our existing global software vendors  systems integrators  or value added resellers may not be able to effectively sell any new products and services that we may introduce  we may not be able to replace existing or recruit additional global software vendors  systems integrators or value added resellers  if we lose any of our existing ones  our global software vendors  systems integrators or value added resellers may also offer competitive products and services  we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities  and our global software vendors  systems integrators or value added resellers may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as compared to our competitors products 
the continued growth of our business may be adversely affected if we fail to form and maintain strategic relationships and business alliances 
our development  marketing and distribution strategies rely increasingly on our ability to form strategic relationships with software and other technology companies 
these business relationships often consist of cooperative marketing programs  joint customer seminars  lead referrals  and cooperation in product development 
many of these relationships are not contractual and depend on the continued voluntary cooperation of each party with us 
divergence in strategy or change in focus by  or competitive product offerings by  any of these companies may interfere with our ability to develop  market  sell  or support our products  which in turn could harm our business 
further  if these companies enter into strategic alliances with other companies or are acquired  they could reduce their support of our products 
our existing relationships may be jeopardized if we enter into alliances with competitors of our strategic partners 
in addition  one or more of 
table of contents these companies may use the information they gain from their relationship with us to develop or market competing products 
our increasing efforts to sell enterprise wide software products and services could expose us to revenue variations and higher operating costs 
we increasingly focus our efforts on sales of enterprise wide solutions  which consist of our entire mercury optimization centers product suite and related professional services  and managed services  rather than on the sale of component products 
as a result  each sale requires substantial time and effort from our sales and support staff as well as involvement by our professional services and managed services organizations and our systems integrator partners 
large individual sales  or even small delays in customer orders  can cause significant variation in our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations for a particular period 
the timing of large orders is usually difficult to predict and  like many software and services companies  many of our customers typically complete transactions in the last month of a quarter 
if we are unable to manage rapid changes  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we have  in the past  experienced significant growth in revenue  employees and number of product and service offerings and we believe this growth may continue 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our management and our financial  operational  marketing and sales systems 
we are implementing and plan to implement in the future a variety of new or expanded business and financial systems  procedures  and controls  including the improvement of our sales and customer support systems 
the implementation of these systems  procedures and controls may not be completed successfully  or may disrupt our operations or our data may not be transitioned properly 
any failure by us to properly manage these transitions could impair our ability to attract and service customers and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and experience delays in the execution of our business plan 
we have also in the past experienced reductions in revenue that required us to rapidly reduce costs 
if we fail to reduce staffing levels when necessary  our costs would be excessive and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
the success of our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel 
we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could hurt our business 
the loss of senior personnel can result in significant disruption to our ongoing operations  and new senior personnel must spend a significant amount of time learning our business and our systems in addition to performing their regular duties 
additionally  our inability to attract new senior executives and key personnel could significantly impact our business results 
for example  ken klein  our chief operating officer and member of our board of directors  left at the end of and we are in the process of hiring a new executive vice president of worldwide field operations who will assume these duties 
our international sales and operations subject us to risks that can adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
sales to customers located outside the us have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue and we anticipate that such sales will continue to be a significant percentage of our revenue 
as a percentage of our total revenues  sales to customers outside the us were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we face risks associated with our international operations  including changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the need to localize products for sale in international markets  longer payment cycles to collect accounts receivable in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity in other parts of the world in which we operate  
table of contents changes in foreign currency exchange rates  geographical turmoil  including terrorism and wars  country or regional political and economic instability  and economic downturns in international markets 
any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales 
for example  some countries in europe  the middle east and africa already have laws and regulations related to technologies used on the internet that are more strict than those currently in force in the us any or all of these factors could cause our business and operating results to be harmed 
because our research and development operations are primarily located in israel  we may be affected by volatile political  economic  and military conditions in that country and by restrictions imposed by that country on the transfer of technology 
our operations depend on the availability of highly skilled scientific and technical personnel in israel 
our business also depends on trading relationships between israel and other countries 
in addition to the risks associated with international sales and operations generally  our operations could be adversely affected if major hostilities involving israel should occur or if trade between israel and its current trading partners were interrupted or curtailed 
these risks are compounded due to the restrictions on our ability to manufacture or transfer outside of israel any technology developed under research and development grants from the government of israel without the prior written consent of the government of israel 
if we are unable to obtain the consent of the government of israel  we may not be able to take advantage of strategic manufacturing and other opportunities outside of israel 
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes if tax rate incentives in israel are altered or if there are other changes in tax laws or rulings 
historically  our operations resulted in a significant amount of income in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment 
our taxes could increase if these tax rate incentives are not renewed upon expiration or tax rates applicable to us are increased 
tax authorities could challenge the manner in which profits are allocated between our subsidiaries and us  and we may not prevail in any such challenge 
if the profits recognized by our subsidiaries in jurisdictions where taxes are lower became subject to income taxes in other jurisdictions  our worldwide effective tax rate would increase 
in addition  to the extent that we are unable to continue to reinvest a substantial portion of our profits in our israeli operations  we may be subject to additional tax rate increases in the future 
other factors that could increase our effective tax rate include the effect of changing economic conditions  business opportunities  and changes in tax laws and rulings 
we have in the past and may continue in the future to retire amounts outstanding under our notes 
to the extent that these repurchases are completed below the par value of the notes  we may generate a taxable gain from these repurchases 
these gains may result in an increase in our effective tax rate 
merger and acquisition activities  if any  could result in nondeductible expenses  which may increase our effective tax rate 
our financial results may be negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
our foreign operations are generally transacted through our international sales subsidiaries in the americas  europe  the middle east and africa emea  asia pacific apac  and japan 
the americas includes brazil  canada  and the united states of america 
emea includes austria  belgium  denmark  finland  france  germany  holland  israel  italy  luxembourg  norway  south africa  spain  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom 
apac includes australia  china  hong kong  india  korea  and singapore 
as a result  these sales and related expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies  including a decrease in the value of currencies in certain of the americas  emea  apac or japan relative to the us dollar  which would decrease our reported us dollar revenue  as we generate revenue in these local currencies and report the related revenue in us dollars  and 
table of contents an increase in the value of currencies in certain of the americas  emea  apac or japan  or israel relative to the us dollar  which would increase our sales and marketing costs in these countries and would increase research and development costs in israel 
we attempt to limit foreign exchange exposure through operational strategies and by using forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany trade balances 
this requires us to estimate when revenue will be earned and cash will be collected 
we may not be successful in making these estimates 
if these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience material currency gains or losses on forward contracts and our financial position and results of operations may be significantly impacted 
acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value  or divert the attention of our management and may result in financial results that are different than expected 
in august  we acquired kintana 
in addition  in may  we completed our acquisition of performant and in may  we acquired freshwater software 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute the ownership of our then existing stockholders  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur charges for the impairment of the value of acquired assets  or incur amortization expense related to intangible assets 
if we fail to achieve the financial and strategic benefits of past and future acquisitions  our operating results will suffer 
acquisitions involve numerous other risks  including difficulties in integrating or coordinating the different research and development  sales programs  facilities  operations  technologies or products  failure to achieve targeted synergies  unanticipated costs and liabilities  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers or those of the acquired organization  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired organizations 
in addition  for purchase acquisitions completed to date  the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical feasibility  changing customer markets and uncertainty of new product standards 
efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consist of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
in the normal course of business  we frequently engage in discussions with parties relating to possible acquisitions 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

table of contents if we are required to account for stock options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  our net income and our earnings per share would be significantly reduced 
there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for equity based compensation  such as employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares and whether they should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we elected or were required to record an expense for our employee stock plans using the fair value method  we would be required to recognize significant stock based compensation charges 
for stock option grants that have an exercise price at fair market value we calculate compensation expense using a fair value method and disclose the pro forma impact on net income loss and net income loss per share  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense using the fair value model in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  it is possible that future laws and regulations will require us to treat all stock based compensation as a compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations using the fair value method 
investments may become impaired and require us to take a charge against earnings 
as of december   we had investments in non consolidated companies of million 
our investments in early stage private companies and a private equity fund were million and the fair value of a warrant to purchase common stock of a private company was million 
in addition  we have committed to invest in the private equity fund for a total of million 
as of december   we have made capital contributions to this fund totaling million 
we may be required to incur charges for the impairment of value of our investments 
for example  for the year ended december   we recorded losses of million  million and million  respectively  on three of our investments in non consolidated companies  and a loss of million on our investment in a private equity fund 
for the year ended december   we recorded losses of million  million and million on three of our investments in non consolidated companies  respectively 
in calculating the loss to be recorded  we took into account the latest valuation of each of the portfolio companies based on recent sales of equity securities to outside third party investors 
for the year ended december   we did not record any losses on our investments in early stage private companies and the private equity fund 
we are closely monitoring the financial health of the private companies in which we hold minority equity investments 
we may continue to make investments in other companies 
if we determine in accordance with our standard accounting policies that an impairment has occurred  then additional losses would be recorded 
in addition  we hold a warrant to purchase common stock of a private company 
the warrant is treated as a derivative instrument due to a net settlement provision 
the warrant is recorded at its fair value on each reporting date 
we calculate the fair value of the warrant using the black scholes option pricing model 
estimating the fair value of the warrant requires management judgment and may have an impact on our financial positions and results of operations 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset  experience reduced revenue  and incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
our success depends in large part of our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secret  and contractual restrictions including confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 
we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and services and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfers and disclosures of our licensed programs may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us to the extent that we increase our international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will increase 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  we are not significantly dependent on any of our patents as we do not generally license our patents to other companies and do not receive any revenue as a direct result of our patents 

table of contents in many cases  we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants and with the customers and corporations with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets 
litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversions of our management resources  which could result in lower revenue  higher operating costs  and adversely affect our operating results 
third parties could assert that our products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to litigation that  with or without merit  could be costly to defend 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against these claims 
parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to sell our products in the us and abroad and could result in an award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties  develop alternative technology  or to alter our products or processes or cease activities that infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
if we are required to obtain licenses  we cannot be sure that we will be able to do so at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain required licenses could delay shipment of our products and increase our costs 
in addition  any such lawsuit could result in our incurring significant costs or the diversion of the attention of our management 
if we fail to obtain or maintain early access to third party software  our future product development may suffer 
software developers have  in the past  provided us with early access to pre generally available versions of their software in order to have input into the functionality and to ensure that we can adapt our software to exploit new functionality in these systems 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products or may prevent us from being able to develop products which will work with such new systems  which could harm our business 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  including an acquisition that would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we have adopted a preferred shares rights agreement which we refer to as our shareholder rights plan on july   as amended 
in connection with the shareholder rights plan  our board of directors declared and paid a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock outstanding on july  in addition  each share of common stock issued after july  was issued  or will be issued  with an accompanying preferred stock purchase right 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 

table of contents in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which will prohibit us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date that the person became an interested stockholder unless  subject to certain exceptions  the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner 
furthermore  certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
leverage and debt service obligations for million in outstanding notes may adversely affect our cash flow 
on april   we issued our notes  with a principal amount of million  in a private placement  and in july  we completed the offering of the notes with a principal amount of million 
from december through december   we retired million face value of our notes 
we continue to carry a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness  primarily the notes and the notes 
there is the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on  and other amounts in respect of our indebtedness when due 
our leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures and acquisitions  and limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap with goldman sachs capital markets  lp gscm with respect to million of our notes 
this interest rate swap could expose us to greater interest expense for our notes 
in addition  the notes would be included in our diluted net income per share calculation if our common stock price reaches a specified threshold or if specified corporate transactions have occurred and if we elect to settle in stock instead of cash 
in this case   shares would be included in both the basic and diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors and possible lawsuits 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the week period ended february   the closing sale prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a high of to a low of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  changes in general economic conditions  terrorist attacks  and the effects of war  conditions or trends affecting the software industry and the internet  
table of contents changes in the rating of our notes or other securities  and changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other software and high technology companies 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future  and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of software or internet software companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
because the and notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  volatility or depressed prices for our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of these notes 
holders who receive common stock upon conversion also will be subject to the risk of volatility and depressed prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of these notes may encourage short selling in our common stock by market participants because the conversion of these notes could depress the price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk includes risk of change in interest rate  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and loss in equity investments 
interest rate risk we mitigate market risk associated with our investments by placing our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or issue 
in addition  we have classified all of our investments as held to maturity 
at december   million  or of our cash  cash equivalents  and investment portfolio have a maturity of less than days  and an additional million  or  carried a maturity of less than one year 
all investments mature  by policy  in less than three years 
information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands december  total fair value investments maturing within days at december  fixed rate weighted average rate investments maturing days after december  fixed rate weighted average rate total investments weighted average rate our long term investments include million of government agency instruments  which have callable provisions and accordingly may be redeemed by the agencies should interest rates fall below the coupon rate of the investments 
the fair value of our notes fluctuates based upon changes in the price of our common stock  changes in interest rates  and changes in our creditworthiness 
the fair market value of our notes at december  was million while the face value and book value was million and million  respectively 
to mitigate the risk of fluctuation in the fair value of our notes  we entered into interest rate 
table of contents swap arrangements 
the fair value of our notes fluctuates based upon changes in the price of our common stock and changes in our creditworthiness 
the fair market value of the notes at december  was million while the face value and the book value was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for transactions regarding our and notes 
in november  we merged our january and february interest rate swaps with goldman sachs capital markets  lp gscm into a single interest rate swap with gscm to improve the overall effectiveness of our interest rate swap arrangement 
the november interest rate swap  with a maturing date of july  is designated as an effective hedge of the change in the fair value attributable to the london interbank offering rate libor of million of our notes 
the objective of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate on our notes to a variable interest rate based on the month libor plus basis points 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value attributable to changes in the libor throughout the life of our notes 
the interest rate swap creates a market exposure to changes in the libor 
if the libor increases or decreases by  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  quarterly on a pretax basis 
according to the terms of the swap  we are required to provide initial collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents to gscm in the amount of million as continuing security for our obligations under the swap irrespective of movements in the value of the swap and from time to time additional collateral can change hands between mercury and gscm as swap rates and equity prices fluctuate 
we accounted for the initial collateral and any additional collateral as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes  we will be required to pay the fixed rate of and receive a variable rate on the million principal amount of the notes 
if we call the notes at a premium in whole or in part  or if any of the holders of the notes elected to convert the notes in whole or in part  we will be required to pay a variable rate and receive the fixed rate of on the principal amount of such called or converted our notes 
we are exposed to credit exposure with respect to gscm as counterparty under the swap 
however  we believe that the risk of such credit exposure is limited because gscm is an affiliate of a major us investment bank and because its obligations under the swap is guaranteed by the goldman sachs group lp also  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our notes and the interest rate swap activities 
foreign exchange rate risk a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
our operating expenses in each of these countries are in the local currencies  which mitigates a significant portion of the exposure related to local currency revenue 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency denominated deferred revenues and receivables due from certain subsidiaries and foreign branches in the americas  emea  apac  and japan 
we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
the forward contracts in effect at december  mature at various dates through december and were hedges of certain foreign currency transaction exposures in the british pound  canadian dollar  danish kroner  euro  japanese yen  norwegian kroner  singapore dollar  south african rand  and swiss franc 
we also utilize forward exchange contracts of one fiscal month duration to offset various non functional currency exposures 
currencies hedged under this program include the australian dollar  canadian dollar  british pound  euro  israeli shekel  and swedish kroner 
we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million at december  there were no forward contracts outstanding at december  
table of contents gains or losses on forward contracts are recognized as other income expense  net in our consolidated statement of operations in the same period as gains or losses on the underlying transactions 
net gains or losses on forward contracts and the underlying transactions did not have any material impact to our financial position 
in addition  the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our operating results or cash flows 
investment risk from time to time  we make investments in early stage private companies and private equity funds for business and strategic purposes 
at december   our investments in private companies and a private equity fund were million 
in addition  we made capital contributions to the private equity fund totaling million and we have committed to pay up to million in the future 
if the companies in which we have made investments do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies  we may not be able to sell these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments  we cannot assure that we will be able to sell them at a gain or even recover our investment 
the potential decline in the nasdaq national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on many of these investments 
for the year ended december   we recorded losses of million  million  and million on three of our investments in early stage private companies and a loss of million on our investment in a private equity fund 
for the year ended december   we recorded losses of million  million  and million on three of our investments in early stage private companies 
in calculating the loss to be recorded  we took into account the latest valuation of each of the portfolio companies based on recent sales of equity securities to outside third party investors 
in addition  we hold a warrant to purchase common stock of a private company 
the warrant is treated as a derivative instrument due to a net settlement provision 
since the warrant is marked to market at each reporting date  any fluctuations in the fair value of the warrant may have an impact on our financial positions and results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the warrant was million
