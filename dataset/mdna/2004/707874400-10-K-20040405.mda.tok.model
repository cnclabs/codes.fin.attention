item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies amounts in thousands  except per share data the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
management has made estimates in the past that we believed to be appropriate but were subsequently revised to reflect actual experience 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if o it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and o changes in the estimate or different estimated amounts that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
policy reserves our policies are accounted for as long duration policies 
as a result there are two components to the liabilities associated with our policies 
the first is a liability for future policyholder benefits  represented by the present value of future benefits less future premium collections 
in calculating these reserves we utilize assumptions  including estimates for persistency policies that do not lapse  morbidity claims expectations  mortality  interest rates  and premium rate increases 
these assumptions are estimated in the year a policy is issued 
once the assumptions are established  we continue to utilize those assumptions unless our assessment of deferred acquisition costs dac indicates that the current unamortized dac asset is not recoverable in future periods 
any variance from the assumptions established in the year a policy is issued could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the significant assumptions utilized in setting our future reserves for policyholder benefits are o a voluntary lapse rate that ranges from to  depending on the age of the policyholder and the number of years the policy has been in force 
a significant majority of our policyholders are between the ages of to at the time we issue them a policy 
the lapse rates range from in the early duration for these policies grading down to in the later durations 
o morbidity based upon past company experience and industry data 
we also include as estimate for improving morbidity trends in the general population 
o the use of the select and ultimate  sex distinct  actuarial table for mortality 
o for policies issued in and  we use a interest rate to discount future experience 
for policies issued prior to  we use a interest discount rate 
o we also include an estimate of premium rate increases based on what we have currently filed or specifically plan to file and or have partially implemented 
long term care insurance has fixed annual premiums that can be adjusted only upon approval of the insurance departments of the states where the premiums were written 
the process for filing for premium rate increases requires the company to demonstrate to the insurance department that expected claims experience is anticipated to exceed original assumptions 
the approval of premium rate increases is at the discretion of the insurance department 
we have filed and implemented premium rate increases on most of our in force policies as a result of experience studies performed prior to based upon our experience studies completed in the third quarter of we have and are continuing to file and implement additional premium rate increases on the majority of our policies 
we have been successful in obtaining premium rate increases in the past 
however  there has been increased public and regulatory scrutiny over the practice of obtaining premium rate increases on long term care insurance 
we base our premium rate increase assumptions on our past experience and our expectations of the amounts of actual rate increases that we will be able to achieve 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the assumed level of rate increases  we could recognize an impairment in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we assume that we will be successful in obtaining of the premium rate increases that we have recently filed 
unless we impair our dac due to an expected loss in future periods using recent assumptions for all of the above  our assumptions remain unchanged in future periods regardless of actual experience 
however  when actual experience differs from our expectations  the incremental difference between actual and expected results is recognized in the current period 
claim reserves the second component is a reserve we establish is for incurred  either reported or not yet reported  claims 
this amount represents the benefits to be paid in the future for our current claims 
the significant assumptions utilized in establishing claim reserves are expectations about the duration and incidence of claims and the interest rate utilized to discount the claim reserves 
these assumptions are based on our past experience  industry experience and current trends 
we establish our claim reserves in each period based upon our most currently available information and assumptions 
we use a discount rate of for claim reserves 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate can cause our claim reserves to increase by approximately  as part of our monitoring of claims reserves  we compare actual results to our expectations 
any deviation from our expectations is recorded in the period in which the deviation occurs 
any changes in our estimates in the future may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
deferred acquisition costs in connection with the sale of our insurance policies  we defer and amoritize a portion of the policy acquisition costs over the related premium paying periods of the life of the policy 
these costs include all expenses that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of the policy  including commissions  underwriting and other policy issue expenses 
the dac is determined using the same projected actuarial assumptions used in computing policy reserves 
we regularly assess the recoverability of our unamortized dac asset through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of anticipated future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than the current unamortized dac then the dac is deemed recoverable 
if this amount is less than the current unamortized dac  then we impair our dac and record a charge in our current period results of operations 
the dac recoverability analysis includes our most recent assumptions for persistency  morbidity  interest rates  and premium rate increases  all or any of which may be different than the assumptions utilized in establishing our benefit reserves 
the significant assumptions utilized in the dac recoverability analysis that differ from our current assumptions for policy reserves and dac include o investment of future cash flows in instruments and at durations similar to our current investment mix  using current market interest rates for new investments new investments are assumed to average 
o an estimate that claims will improve due to the expected results from recently implememted and future planned improvements to our claims adjudication procedures 
o a estimate that the ultimate level of premium rate increases that will be approved and implemented will be higher than originally assumed percentage of 
changes in one or a combination of these assumptions can produce significant volatility in the recoverability of dac 
litigation and contingencies we are involved in lawsuits relating to our operations 
these lawsuits include  but are not limited to  allegations as to improper sales practices in connection with the recent premium rate increases on our long term care policies 
we are also involved in a dispute with one of our reinsurers over an alleged breach of contract by the company as a result of the company entering into the centre reinsurance agreement without obtaining prior written approval of the reinsurer 
we have contested this assertion of breach and are continuing discussions with reinsurer to reach an equitable resolution  including  but not limited to  arbitration  the recapture of the coverage and reserves  premium rate increases  or additional reinsurance business in the future 
reinsurance recoverables related to this treaty were  and  at december  and  respectively 
we have additional reinsurance agreements with the same reinsurer  for which it has also claimed the same breach 
however  none of the reinsured policies were ceded to centre solutions bermuda  inc and we believe any claim of breach is baseless 
we recognize an estimated loss for contingencies when we believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation and contingency matters 
as time passes and additional facts and circumstances become known  our estimation of the probability of loss as well as our ability to reasonably estimate a loss will change 
the ultimate outcome of litigation and other contingencies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position in the future 
deposit accounting for centre reinsurance agreement the centre reinsurance agreement is being accounted for utilizing deposit accounting for reinsurance contracts 
we are using deposit accounting because we believe the reinsurance contract does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer will suffer a significant loss 
we assessed this long duration reinsurance contract using the reasonable possibility of significant loss criteria due to certain contract provisions that limit the risk to the reinsurer  including an aggregate limit of liability for the reinsurer  experience refund provisions  and expense and risk charges provided to the reinsurer 
we also entered into the reinsurance agreement with the intent of commuting the agreement at december   which further supports the use of deposit accounting 
we have established the accounting model for this reinsurance agreement assuming that we will commute the contract on december   the first available commutation date 
we intend  but are not required  to commute the agreement on december  we have significant incentive to commute the agreement on december  as the expense and risk charges applied to the notional experience account for the benefit of the reinsurer begin to escalate after december  and the reinsurer may exercise warrants at a common stock equivalent price of per share  representing approximately of the then outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
our current modeling and actuarial projections suggest that we are likely to be able to commute the agreement  as planned  on december  in order to commute the agreement  our statutory capital following commutation must be sufficient to support the reacquired business in compliance with all statutory requirements 
upon commutation  we would receive cash or other liquid assets equaling the market value of our notional experience account from the reinsurer 
we would also record the necessary reserves for the business in our statutory financial statements 
our ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the market value of the notional experience account exceeding the level of required reserves to be established 
as of december   the statutory basis reserve liabilities of  exceed the combination of the notional experience account value and funds held due to the reinsurer of  based upon our current modeling and actuarial projections  management expects the value of the notional experience account to exceed the reserve liabilities at december  in addition to the performance of the reinsured policies from now until  the notional experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current notional experience account by approximately  and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our notional experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the experience account balance prior to commutation 
when we become highly confident of our ability to support the reinsured policies  we will notify the reinsurer of our intention to commute the agreement on december  the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the experience account at that time  and to then invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility 
as a result of our intention to commute  we considered only the expense and risk charges anticipated prior to the commutation date in its unamortized dac recoverability analyses and has not recorded the potential of future escalating charges 
in the event we determine that commutation of the reinsurance agreement is unlikely on december   but likely at some future date  we will include additional annual expense and risk charge credits against our notional experience account in our dac recoverability analysis 
as a result  we could impair the value of our dac asset and record the impairment in our financial statements 
however  we currently believe that we will have sufficient statutory capital and surplus to commute the reinsurance agreement on december  or that sufficient alternatives  such as additional capital issuance or new reinsurance opportunities  are available to enable us to commute the agreement as planned 
as part of our reinsurance agreement  effective december   the reinsurer was granted four tranches of warrants to purchase shares of non voting convertible preferred stock 
the first three tranches of warrants are exercisable through december  at common stock equivalent prices ranging from to per share 
if exercised and converted  the convertible preferred stock would represent approximately of the then outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis 
if the agreement is not commuted on december   the reinsurer may exercise the fourth tranche of convertible preferred stock purchase warrants at a common stock equivalent price of per share  which if converted would represent an additional of the then outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
we are recognizing the additional consideration of entering into the agreement  represented by the fair value of the warrants granted to the reinsurer  over the period of time to the expected commutation date 
notional experience account our centre reinsurance agreement includes a provision for the maintenance of a notional experience account for our benefit in the event we elect to  and are able to  commute the reinsurance agreement in the future 
the notional experience account balance was  as of december  we receive a return on the experience account that is based on a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges 
the benchmark indices are comprised of us treasury strips  agencies  and investment grade corporate bonds with weightings of approximately  and  respectively and a duration of approximately years 
we believe the return on the notional experience account represents a hybrid instrument  containing both a fixed debt host and an embedded derivative  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we are accounting for the investment return on the experience account as follows a 
the fixed debt host yields a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices 
the return on the fixed debt host is reported as investment income in the statements of income and comprehensive income 
b 
the change in fair value of the embedded derivative represents the percentage change in the underlying indices applied to the notional experience account  similar to that of an unrealized gain loss on a bond 
the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative is reported as market gain or loss on notional experience account in the statements of income and comprehensive income 
our conclusion that the return on the notional experience account represents a hybrid instrument with an embedded derivative is based on our belief that the economic characteristics and risk of the fixed debt host contract are not clearly and closely related to those of the embedded derivative 
when we determine the yield on the fixed debt host and the value of the embedded derivate  we reconcile these amounts to the amount credited to the experience account by the reinsurer  as we believe the actual return credited by the reinsurer should equal the sum of the amounts recognized in our statements of income and comprehensive income 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current notional experience account by approximately  and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the experience account balance prior to commutation 
we intend to give notice to the reinsurer of our intention to commute on december  at such time as we are highly confident of our ability to support the reacquired policies 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the experience account at that time  and to then invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility 
goodwill at december   the balance of our goodwill was  the goodwill relates to our agency operations 
the agency valuation is sensitive to future growth in sales of insurance policies  the persistency of the renewal commission stream and expense saving initiatives that we have implemented 
we utilized a discount rate in the goodwill analysis 
we assume that our agencies are capable of future growth from both the sale of our products and from the sale of other carriers products 
our future growth assumptions  range from in the first years and stabilize at in the later years of our analysis 
the growth rates in the early years are dependent upon the ability of our agencies to execute on recently signed agreements with unaffiliated insurance companies and to sell policies underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries 
our insurance subsidiaries have recommenced sales in states since february  after the cessation of sales in september the goodwill analysis for our agencies is sensitive to the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to successfully supply product that is competitive and to improve their financial strength ratings 
future growth in sales is also dependent upon recent contracts to sell insurance products of unaffiliated insurance companies 
if the future growth in sales or expense savings initiatives do not occur as we anticipate  we may realize an impairment in the goodwill allocated to the agency operations in the future 
preferred interest on early conversion holders of our convertible subordinated notes are entitled to convert their notes into shares of our common stock before october and receive a discounted amount of interest that they would have otherwise received until that date 
we may elect to pay this interest in cash or in newly issued shares of common stock 
if we elect to pay in newly issued shares of common stock  the stock is valued at a discount to the then fair market value of traded shares 
we have determined that this feature is an embedded derivative as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host contract  the convertible subordinated notes  because it could at least double the investor s initial rate of return on the host contract and could also result in a rate of return that is at least twice what otherwise would be the market return for a contract that has the same terms as the host contract and that involves a debtor with a similar credit quality 
as a result of this determination  we have separately valued and bifurcated the embedded derivative from the host contract 
at each balance sheet date  the embedded derivative must be recorded at fair value  with any change in fair value recognized in current operations 
as of december  the fair value of the embedded derivative was  in determining the fair value of the embedded derivative  we make certain assumptions  including the future volatility and liquidity of the company s common stock 
we believe the liquidity of the stock significantly impacts the assumed value of the embedded derivative due to the optionality of the ability for a converting holder to liquidate the shares and recognize its intended value 
we also take into consideration recent trends in the number of holders converting 
if we assumed that all holders converted on december   without giving any consideration to the relationship of the current share price to the conversion price or to the impact of this level of conversions on the stock price  the value of the embedded derivative would be  if actual experience differs from our current assumptions  our results of operations may be subject to significant volatility in future periods 
valuation allowance for income taxes we have net operating loss carryforwards of  or  on a tax effected basis  which have been generated by taxable losses at the parent company  and if unused will expire between and we have net operating loss carryforwards of  or  on a tax effected basis  which have been generated by taxable losses at our insurance subsidiaries  and if unused  will expire in in  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately  against our operating loss carryforwards 
the parent company s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized by our insurance subsidiaries  subject to the lesser of of the insurance subsidiary taxable income or of the current aggregate carryforward amount 
during  we established a valuation allowance of we recorded the valuation allowance in due to a change in ownership as defined in the internal revenue code 
as a result of the change in ownership we are now subject to a limitation on the amount of prior period net operatiing loss carryforwards we can utilize 
if we do not generate enough taxable income in the future we may need to record an additional valuation allowance  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview our principal products are individual  defined benefit accident and health insurance policies that consist of nursing home care  home health care and medicare supplement 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the states in which they are licensed to write insurance 
these laws and regulations govern matters such as payment of dividends  settlement of claims and loss ratios 
state regulatory authorities must approve premiums charged for insurance products 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are required to establish and maintain reserves with respect to reported and incurred but not reported claims  as well as estimated future benefits payable under our insurance policies 
these reserves must  at a minimum  comply with mandated standards 
our reserves are certified annually by our consulting actuary as to standards required by the insurance departments for our domiciliary states and for the other states in which we conduct business 
we believe we maintained adequate reserves as mandated by each state in which we are currently writing business at september  for a description of current regulatory matters affecting our insurance subsidiaries  see liquidity and capital resources subsidiary operations 
in addition to the critical accounting policies listed above  our results of operations are affected by the following lapsation and persistency 
our financial condition and results of operations may be effected by lapsation and persistency  both of which relate to the renewal of insurance policies 
lapsation is the termination of a policy by non renewal 
lapsation is automatic if and when premiums become more than days overdue  although  in some cases  a lapsed policy may be reinstated within six months 
policy premium levels 
we attempt to set premium levels to maintain planned profit margins 
premium levels on new products  as well as rate increases on existing products  are subject to government review and regulation 
we may be limited in our ability to gain approval for premium rate increases such that future profit margins could be reduced or prior losses may not be recouped 
economic cycles can influence a policyholder s ability to continue the payment of insurance premiums when due 
we believe that publicity regarding federal and state tax legislation allowing medical deductions for certain long term care insurance premiums has raised public awareness of the escalating costs of long term care and the value provided to the consumer by long term care insurance 
the ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries by independent rating agencies also influence consumer decisions 
results of operations twelve months ended december  and amounts in thousands premium revenue 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve months ended december  the period  including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  decreased to  compared to  in the same period in the period 
effective september   we determined to discontinue the sale nationally of all new long term care insurance policies until the plan was completed and approved by the department 
this decision resulted from our concern about further depletion of statutory surplus from new policy sales prior to the completion and approval of the plan and from increasing concern with respect to the status of the plan expressed by many states in which the company is licensed to conduct business 
upon the department s approval of the plan in february  we recommenced new policy sales in states  including pennsylvania 
we are now approved to recommence new policy sales in additional states  including florida subject to a corrective order 
these states accounted for approximately in aggregate of our total direct premium revenue for the period 
florida and pennsylvania accounted for approximately and  respectively of our direct premium revenue for the period 
we have recently agreed upon terms for the recommencement of sales in california  subject to certain conditions and approval of our filed product forms and rates 
california renewal premiums represented approximately of our direct premium revenue for the period 
we are actively working with the remaining states to recommence new policy sales in all jurisdictions 
total first year premium revenue earned in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
first year long term care premiums earned in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
we anticipate that first year premium revenue will continue to increase as independent agents that sold our policies prior to the cessation of sales are reengaged and independent agents that had not previously sold our policies are recruited 
we also anticipate that we will recommence sales in additional states in which we are currently not writing new business 
in addition  we are also preparing to file a new medicare supplement policy in certain states  which we anticipate will be available for sale in the third quarter of total renewal premium revenue earned in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
renewal long term care premiums earned in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
the decrease in renewal premium revenue is due to the lapsation of existing policies and a reduced level of new premium levels compared to periods prior to the cessation of sales in l 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience reduced levels of renewal premium revenue until such time as an increased level of new premiums is sufficient to offset the lapsation of existing policies 
our persistency was and for the and periods  respectively 
the persistency in period was significantly affected due to shock lapses from premium rate increases implemented 
net investment income 
net investment income earned for the period increased to  from  for the period 
as a result of our centre agreement  substantially all of our investments generated from business written prior to december  were transferred to the reinsurer in february the reinsurer maintains a notional experience account on our behalf in the event that the reinsurance agreement is later commuted 
the notional experience account is credited with an investment credit equal to the most recent yield to maturity of a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges  which are designed to closely match the duration of our liabilities 
our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was and  respectively  in the and periods 
the investment income component of our notional experience account investment credit generated  and  in the and periods  respectively 
the notional experience account yields a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices  which are comprised of us treasury strips  government agencies and investment grade corporate bonds with weightings of approximately  and  respectively  and have duration of approximately years 
the average yield on the notional experience account was and for the and periods  respectively 
net realized capital gains and trading account activity 
during the period  our capital gains were  compared to capital gains of  in the period 
we accounted for the transfer of the securities portion of the initial premium payment for our centre agreement during the period as a sale of these assets 
substantially all of the recognized capital gains in the period resulted from the transfer of the initial premium of approximately  to the reinsurer 
the results in the period were recorded due to normal investment management activity 
market gain loss on notional experience account 
we recorded a loss on our notional experience account of  in the period compared to a market gain of  in the period 
during the period the interest rates on the underlying investments in the benchmark indices supporting our notional experience account were declining  resulting in a market gain 
during the period  although interest rates were volatile during the year  interest rates at the beginning and end of the year were relatively unchanged 
the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was and for and  respectively 
the total return on our notional experience account  which generates the majority of our net investment income  was and in the and periods  respectively 
management attributes the favorable return achieved from its notional experience account in to a longer duration of the underlying benchmark indices  which were positively impacted by declining market interest rates during the lower interest rates that caused the gains in the period produced lower yields in change in preferred interest on early conversion 
holders of our convertible subordinated notes are entitled to convert their notes into shares of our common stock before october and receive a discounted amount of interest that they would have otherwise received until that date 
we may elect to pay this interest in cash or in newly issued shares of common stock 
we have determined that this feature is an embedded derivative as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as discussed in critical accounting policies  we have separately valued and bifurcated the embedded derivative from the notes 
at each balance sheet date  the embedded derivative must be recorded at fair value  with any change in fair value recognized in current operations 
the fair value of the embedded derivative as of the date that the option to receive discounted interest was granted was  as of december   we adjusted the embedded derivative to its then fair value of  by recording a loss of we believe that the value of the embedded derivative is significantly affected by the ability of the investor to liquidate their shares in the market 
we further believe that the number of shares of our common stock outstanding and the average daily trading volume of our common stock provide an indication of the ability for the market to bear additional sales of stock without a material degradation of the current market value of those shares 
during  the liquidity of our common stock rose significantly  as did the average daily trading volume  which indicated to us that the market could absorb additional shares without significant degradation of the market price 
as a result  we increased our estimates of the value of the embedded derivative based on an assumption that conversions were more likely to occur without stock price deflation 
in determining the fair value of the embedded derivative  the company makes certain assumptions  including the future volatility and liquidity of the company s common stock 
if actual experience deviates from current assumptions  our financial results may be significantly impacted in future periods 
other income 
we recorded  in other income during the period  as compared to  in the period 
in the period  we recorded approximately as other income related to the recognition of a deferred gain relating to the sale of our disability business  as compared to  in the period 
the sale was done as a quota share agreement  in contemplation of a subsequent assumption of the business  where actual ownership of the policies would change 
the gain on the sale is recognized as the ownership of the policies changes 
in addition  the income generated from our ownership of corporate owned life insurance policies decreased to  in the period  as compared to  in the period 
the cash value of these policies is invested in investment grade corporate bonds and equity indexes 
the average yield on the income generated from the corporate owned life insurance was in the period  compared to in the period 
benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in the period  compared to in the period 
excluding the impact of a refinement of our assumptions and processes and a change in interest discounting  our loss ratio in the period was approximately compared to the period loss ratio of 
we believe the improvement in the loss ratio is primarily due to the impact of premium rate increases and better than anticipated development of our claim reserves for prior year incurrals 
we establish reserves for current claims based upon current and historical experience of our policyholder benefits  including an expectation of claims incidence and duration  as well as the establishment of a reserve for claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported ibnr 
we continuously monitor our experience to determine the best estimate of reserves to be held for future payments of these claims 
as a result  we periodically refine our process to incorporate the most recent known information in establishing these reserves 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
this favorable amount of  and unfavorable amount of  in and  respectively  from prior year end reserve balances plus adjustments to reflect actual versus estimated claims experience 
these adjustments particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
the adjustments to reserves for claims incurred in prior periods are primarily attributable to claims incurred from our long term care insurance policies  which represent approximately of our premium in force 
the development of our prior year assumptions were in line with our expectations and included the reduction of our claim reserves of approximately  in the quarter ended june  the reduction related to new claims adjudication procedures for family member and private caregiver services  following an internal review of historic home health care claims and external consultant guidance 
the new protocols include increased in home assessments and additional plan of care structure 
during the period we refined our assumptions and process for developing our claim reserves 
this included redefining certain multiple claims as a single claim and employing new assumptions and processes for predicting the continuance  or the likelihood of a claim continuing in the future 
this resulted in an increase to claims reserves of approximately further we employed a lower discount rate of in the period  which increased our claims reserves by approximately  we believe that  as a result of lower market interest rates  the lower discount rate more closely matched our anticipated return from the investment of assets supporting these reserves 
we continue to use the discount rate in the period 
when we experience deviation from our estimates  we typically seek premium rate increases that are sufficient to offset future deviation 
we have filed and implemented premium rate increases on most of our in force policies as a result of experience studies performed prior to based upon our most recent experience and assumptions relating to future claims experience  we have and are continuing to file and implement additional premium rate increases on the majority of our products based upon our claims studies completed in we have been generally successful in the past in obtaining state insurance department approvals for increases 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining future rate increases when deemed necessary  or if we do not pursue rate increases when actual claims experience exceeds our expectations  we would suffer a financial loss 
we may also be susceptible to adverse selection in our claims experience resulting from the lapse of healthier policyholders that do not elect to renew their policies at the higher premium rates 
commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in the period  compared to  in the period 
first year commissions on accident and health business in the period increased to  compared to  in the period  due to the increase in first year accident and health premiums 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in the period and in the period 
the first year commission ratio for both the and periods is lower than the first year commission ratio prior to the cessation of sales in  due to the increased sale of our secured risk  medicare supplement and franchise group policies as a percentage of total new sales 
all of these policies pay a lower commission as a percentage of premium revenue to agents than our individual long term care policies 
we believe that sales of these policies as a percentage of new sales are likely to remain at this level as we recommence sales in many states 
we believe that the sale of long term care policies has declined as a percentage of sales as a result of our lower financial ratings with am best and standard and poor s rating services and continued consumer and agent concerns regarding our financial strength 
renewal commissions on accident and health business in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period due to the decrease in renewal accident and health premiums 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in the period and in the period 
we have implemented premium rate increases on a majority of policies written prior to december  we do not pay commissions on the additional premium collected as a result of a rate increase  which reduces the ratio of renewal commissions to renewal premium revenue 
we anticipate that this ratio will continue to decline until the premium rate increases are fully implemented  which we anticipate will occur prior to the end of net policy acquisition costs amortized deferred 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs in the period increased to a net amortization of costs of  compared to  in the period 
deferred costs are typically all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of new premiums 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commissions less ultimate renewal commissions  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy sales  underwriting and issuance 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event that a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the net amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is affected by new business generation  imputed interest on prior reserves and policy persistency 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premium generation 
however  lower new premium sales during the and periods  as compared to sales prior to the cessation of new sales in  produced significantly less expense deferral to offset amortized costs 
we regularly assess the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than current unamortized deferred acquisition costs  the unamortized amount is deemed recoverable 
in the event recoverability is not demonstrated  we reassess the calculation using justifiable premium rate increases 
if rate increases are not received or are deemed unjustified  we will expense  as impaired  the attributed portion of the deferred asset in the current period 
if we conclude that the deferred acquisition costs are impaired  we will record an impairment loss and a reduction in the deferred acquisition cost asset 
in the event of an impairment  we will also evaluate our historical assumptions utilized in establishing the policy reserves and deferred acquisition costs and may update those assumptions to reflect current experience referred to as unlocking 
the primary assumptions include persistency  claims expectations  interest rates and rate increases 
during the period  we determined to recognize a dac impairment charge of  primarily as a result of the incorporation of certain assumptions related to the future profitability of our current business in force 
these assumptions included the use of a lower discount rate  which reflects the current interest rate environment  higher anticipated claims costs due to newly estimated claim duration and reasonable expected future premium rate increases on policies for which we have already filed or anticipate filing 
in the event that premium rate increases cannot be obtained as needed  or our actual experience differs from our assumptions  our dac could be further impaired and we would incur an expense in the amount of the impairment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
the ratio of total general and administrative expenses to premium revenues was in the period  compared to in the period 
the primary contributors to our expense growth in the period were as follows new sales related expenses as our new premium revenue has increased with the recommencement of sales  the variable costs associated with marketing and acquiring new premium revenue has also increased 
these costs which include medical records and cognitive impairment screenings associated with the underwriting process  printing  supplies and sales promotions were  in the period  compared to  in the period 
in addition to the variable costs associated with new premium growth we also increased our marketing infrastructure during the period through the addition of a chief marketing officer  a national sales vice president and two additional field vice presidents 
the salaries and benefits associated with these new positions was in the period 
expenses have increased approximately  in the period compared to the period at one of our agency subsidiaries  primarily because it has expanded its regional office structure in order to increase its ability to sell additional new long term care policies that we and other companies offer 
we continue to analyze the productivity of these offices with an expectation that operating expenses will be offset by new commission revenue within to months 
we have determined that certain of these offices are not generating sufficient additional revenue to support existing overhead  and  as a result have closed several unproductive sites prior to december  financial and actuarial capability we have added two actuarial officers and three finance officers during the and period 
these positions were added in order to enhance our abilities to analyze our business through the use of customized actuarial models  to ensure compliance with sarbanes oxley regulations  and to improve our financial analysis capabilities 
we also anticipate that we will reduce the reliance on outside consultants that we have used in the past to fulfill these roles 
the salaries and benefits associated with these new positions were in the period as compared to in the period 
human resource modifications during the period we recorded expense of approximately  related to the initial recognition of future retirement benefits payable to our former chairman and severance related expenses for certain managers and employees whose positions were eliminated 
we estimate that we will recognize future annual savings related to the salaries and benefits related to these positions of approximately  in addition  salary increases  changes in our vacation policy  increases in the cost of healthcare and officer bonuses increased salary and benefit expense by approximately  in the period 
litigation expenses legal fees increased to  in the period  compared to  in the period 
the increase relates to expenses associated with the ongoing discovery process and the completion of depositions in the national healthcare services  inc litigation  and expenses associated with numerous motions filed and preliminary discovery conducted in connection with litigation related to the sale of long term care policies 
system replacement project we maintain our own computer system for most aspects of our operations  including policy issuance  billing  claims processing  commissions  premiums and general ledger 
we believe that our overall systems are an integral component in delivering that service 
accordingly  we have started development of asystem replacement project srp 
in  we determined  based upon our assessment of currently available long term care processing systems that we would be better served to build our own program  which would incorporate the specific requirements deemed necessary to support our unique current and planned business processes 
we recorded an expense of in the period  compared to in the period related to the srp 
having completed a significant portion of our needs assessment and rules development  and a portion of the programming necessary  we reevaluated the time and expense required to fully implement the srp 
we currently believe  based upon a review of certain vendor solutions recently introduced or more fully tested  that we will be able to modify our plans for an internally developed program and utilize a new vendor solution while maximizing the use of our efforts and capitalized costs to date 
in relation to this decision to leverage the assistance gained with a new vendor solution  we have recorded an impairment expense of in the period 
we are currently evaluating proposals from vendors and anticipate making a determination on a new vendor during the second quarter of we believe that we currently have substantial capacity for premium growth at our current staff levels  print inventories and other expense categories 
we also believe that our current expense levels represent the minimum requirements necessary to reengage agents in additional sales territories  design competitive product lines and properly underwrite new policy applications 
however  we believe that if we remain unable to write new business in certain states where we have ceased new production  or if we are unable to use our existing staff and infrastructure capacity to generate additional premium revenue  we will need to decrease production expenses  which could result in decisions to reduce our staff or other operating functions further 
expense and risk charges on reinsurance and excise tax expense 
our reinsurance agreement provides the reinsurer with annual expense and risk charges  which are credited against our notional experience account in the event of future commutation of the agreement 
the annual charge consists of a fixed cost and a variable component based upon reserve and capital levels needed to support the reinsured business 
in the and period  we incurred charges of  and  respectively for this item 
in addition  we are subject to an excise tax for premium payments made to a foreign reinsurer equal to one percent of the premium revenue ceded to the foreign reinsurer 
we recorded  and  for excise tax expenses in the and periods  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
the interest expense in the period is primarily related to our convertible subordinated notes  which pay interest at an annual percentage rate of and had an outstanding aggregate principal balance of  throughout the period 
during the period  we issued  of additional convertible subordinated notes and paid our entire obligation of  related to convertible subordinated notes that matured in our average outstanding convertible subordinated debt for was  holders of our convertible subordinated notes are entitled to convert their notes into shares of our common stock before october and receive a discounted amount of interest that they would have otherwise received through october had they not converted the notes 
as a result of additional issuances of notes  interest expense in the period increased  in addition  we incurred  of interest expense from the early conversion of  in convertible subordinated notes during the period 
benefit for federal income taxes 
our benefit for federal income taxes for the period decreased to  compared  for the period 
our effective tax rate decreased to in the period compared to in the period 
the decrease in the effective rate is due to a  valuation allowance we recorded in the period for a portion of our current tax net operating loss carryforwards as a result of potential future limitations on their use due to internal revenue code section the internal revenue service has established rules that potentially limit a company s use of prior period net operating loss carryforwards in the event that a majority of the company s common stock ownership changes within any three year period 
due to the issuance of additional shares of our common stock since may and conversions of our convertible subordinated notes during and the first quarter of  we have become subject to these limitations 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
we recognized an impairment loss of  in the period as a result of our transitional impairment test of goodwill 
twelve months ended december  and amounts in thousands premiums 
total premium revenue earned in the period  including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  decreased to  compared to  in the same period in the period 
total first year premiums earned in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
first year long term care premiums earned in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
we experienced significant reductions in new premium sales due to the cessation of new business generation in all states in and due to continued market concerns regarding our insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus 
under our plan  which was approved by the department in the first quarter  we recommenced sales in certain states  but intend to limit new business growth to levels that will allow us to maintain sufficient statutory surplus 
see liquidity and capital resources 
total renewal premiums earned in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
renewal long term care premiums earned in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
the majority of this increase resulted from the receipt of increased revenue following the implementation of premium rate increases filed before the end of  most of which were implemented during the period 
persistency decreased from in the period to in the period 
net investment income 
net investment income earned for the period increased to  from  for the period 
as a result of our centre agreement  substantially all of our investable assets from business written prior to december   were transferred to the reinsurer in february the reinsurer maintains a notional experience account on our behalf in the event that the reinsurance agreement is later commuted 
as discussed above in overview  the notional experience account is credited with an investment credit equal to the most recent yield to maturity of a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges  which are designed to closely match the duration of our liabilities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was and  respectively  in the and periods 
although market rates have declined  the higher yield in the period resulted from a significant change in our portfolio 
in  we held a portfolio of bonds with a duration of approximately years and common stocks 
the investment income component of our notional experience account investment credit generated  in the period  with an average yield of 
the notional experience account yields a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices  which are comprised of us treasury strips  agencies and investment grade corporate bonds  with weightings of approximately  and  respectively  and have a duration of approximately years 
net realized capital gains and trading account activity 
during the period  we recognized capital gains of  compared to capital losses of  in the period 
we accounted for the transfer of the securities portion of the initial premium payment for our new reinsurance agreement as a sale of these assets 
substantially all of the recognized capital gains in the period resulted from the transfer of the initial premium of approximately  to the reinsurer 
the results in the period were recorded primarily due to the impairment of all unrealized losses in our investment portfolio as other than temporary declines 
this determination resulted from our decision to transfer substantially all of our investable assets to the reinsurer  which would prevent the future recovery of these unrealized losses 
during the period  we classified our convertible bond portfolio as trading account investments 
changes in trading account investment market values were recorded in our statements of income and comprehensive income during the period in which the change occurred  rather than as an unrealized gain or loss recorded directly through equity 
as a result  we recorded a trading account loss in the period of  which reflected the unrealized and realized loss of our convertible portfolio that arose during that period 
no investments were classified as trading during the period 
market gain loss on experience account 
we recorded a market gain on our notional experience account balance of  in the period 
as discussed in overview and net investment income above  the reinsurer maintains a notional experience account for our benefit in the event of future recapture of the reinsured business 
the notional experience account receives an investment credit based upon the total return of a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges  which are designed to closely match the duration of our reserve liabilities 
periodic changes in the market values of the benchmark indices and derivative hedges are recorded in our financial statements as a realized gain or loss in the period in which they occur 
the notional experience account is susceptible to market interest rate changes and as a result  our future financial statements are subject to significant volatility 
during the period the interest rates on the underlying investments in the benchmark indices were declining resulting in a market gain 
the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was and for and  respectively 
the total return on our experience account  which comprises the majority of our investible assets  was in the period and the total return of our fixed income portfolio in was 
management attributes the favorable return achieved from its experience account in to a longer duration of the underlying benchmark indices  which were positively impacted by declining market interest rates during the performance of our portfolio in  which did not include an experience account  was similar to the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index 
other income 
we recorded  in other income during the period  up from  in the period 
the increase is attributable primarily to the recognition of a deferred gain from the sale of our disability business 
the sale was done as a quota share agreement  in contemplation of a subsequent assumption of the business  where actual ownership of the policies would change 
in the period  approximately of the policies were assumed and we recorded  as other income 
benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in the period  compared to in the period 
as discussed in overview above  we establish reserves for current claims based upon current and historical experience of our policyholder benefits  including an expectation of claims incidence and duration  as well as the establishment of a reserve for claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported ibnr 
we continuously monitor our experience to determine the best estimate of reserves to be held for future payments of these claims 
as a result  we periodically refine our process to incorporate the most recent known information in establishing these reserves 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
this amount of  and  in and  respectively  from prior year end reserve balances plus adjustments to reflect actual versus estimated claims experience 
these adjustments particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
the adjustments to reserves for claims incurred in prior periods are primarily attributable to claims incurred from our long term care insurance policies  which represent approximately of our premium in force 
to estimate reserves for future claims payments more precisely  we have refined our assumptions and processes for developing these reserves 
during the third quarter  we completed an analysis of the adverse deviation recognized in the past development of our reserves for current claims 
as a result of this analysis  our actuarial modeling suggested that future claim payments would likely exceed our past assumptions  which  if unaddressed  could continue to cause future adverse deviation 
as a result  we have made two modifications to our process for developing claims reserves a redefinition of claims over the past years  our percentage of policies in force offering benefits for both nursing facility and in home health care coverage has increased 
we have recorded claims that begin in one type of care and later move to another type of care as two separate claims 
defining claims in this manner has projected a greater number of expected claims from certain types of policies  as well as a shorter expected length of individual claims 
we have now determined to define this as one claim  using the earliest date of service as the incurral date 
this redefinition of claims results in fewer expected future claims  but anticipates that each claim will last longer 
b continuance assumptions once a claim occurs  we develop claim reserves by using continuance tables  which measure the likelihood of a claim continuing in the future 
historically  we have applied every claim to a set of uniform continuance tables 
our actuarial modeling suggests that this assumption and process no longer reflects the increasing number of claims from policies with longer benefit periods or increased benefit amounts 
we have refined our assumptions and processes by creating separate continuance patterns for facility  home health and comprehensive care  as well as for tax qualified and non qualified plans 
in addition  we have established separate continuance tables for claims caused by cognitive impairment 
as a result  we believe that the duration of existing claims will be longer than was previously expected and have adopted this assumption and process change 
by redefining these multiple claims as a single claim and by employing new assumptions and processes for predicting the continuance of claims  we are confident that we can predict future claims development with a much higher degree of precision 
by identifying trends earlier  we would have seen substantially less adverse deviation from expected results in the development of claims reserves 
we believe that the new assumptions will serve to reduce future reserve volatility by more closely predicting future claims development 
as a result of this redefinition of claims and employment of new continuance tables for separate types of claims  we increased our policy and contract claims by  in the third quarter of  which is primarily attributable to claims incurred prior to january  the new continuance tables have been applied to all claims in the determination of our claims reserves at december  we expect to continue the evaluation of these continuance tables in the future  making adjustments to our expectations as further experience develops and is analyzed 
our process to determine new continuance tables included the evaluation of historical claims payments and duration 
during our review  we recognized that our claims experience had deteriorated in and  and was improving during the latter part of and further examination in the fourth quarter of indicated that several changes that we employed in our claims management process have impacted the recent results of our claims and are expected to improve our results in the future 
these changes include new underwriting protocols  further development of our internal care management staff  which enables all new claims to be screened by nurses that are able to assist the claimant in the development of a proper plan of care  more experienced claim staff that are better able to adjudicate new and existing claims  and the use of hospital and home health care provider networks that offer discounted pricing for claimants using their services 
in addition  we have recently implemented a fraud prevention and quality assurance unit  that while not yet fully developed  is expected to identify and terminate fraudulent claims 
we believe that these and other changes currently contemplated could reduce future claims below the levels anticipated as a result of our third quarter analysis 
in our year end claim reserve analysis  we continued to see positive trends 
accordingly  we have considered these trends in evaluating our claims reserves 
we estimate that the impact of the reflection of these trends results in a reduction of our claims reserves of approximately or  this  has increased earnings in the fourth quarter of further  by employing a lower discount rate of in the period  rather than the that had been used in prior periods  we increased our claims reserves by approximately  we believe that  as a result of lower market interest rates  the lower discount rate more closely matches our currently anticipated return from the investment of assets supporting these reserves 
in  two factors affected the reserves we held for claims incurred in prior years 
excluding  from the effect of imputed interest  we added  to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals 
prior to  we based our expectations on claim continuance patterns determined from our historical claims payments 
in  we engaged a new consulting actuary that provided us with additional industry data to incorporate in our revised continuance expectations the probability that a claim in one duration will continue to another 
our analysis of this supplemental data suggested that we would recognize higher future payments on currently incurred claims than was previously anticipated 
as a result  we lengthened our continuance tables for claim durations beyond the third year  and increased our reserves held for claims incurred to record this liability 
we believe that our experience for claims in the first  second and third duration was consistent with industry data and  therefore  did not alter this portion of our continuance tables 
in  we reduced the discount rate used in the establishment of reserves to appropriately reflect the current investment rate earned on assets supporting this liability 
as a result  reserves for claims incurred in prior years was increased  commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in the period  compared to  in the period 
first year commissions on accident and health business in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period  due to the decrease in first year accident and health premiums 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in the period and in the period 
we believe that the decrease in the first year commission ratio is primarily attributable to the increased sale of our secured risk  medicare supplement and franchise group policy as a percentage of total sales 
all of these policies pay a lower commission as a percentage of premium revenue than our individual long term care policies 
our secured risk policy provides limited benefits to higher risk policyholders at a substantially increased premium rate 
we believe that sales of these policies as a percentage of new sales are likely to remain at this level when we recommence sales in many states as a result of our lower financial ratings with am best and standard and poor s rating services 
renewal commissions on accident and health business in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in the period and in the period 
we began the implementation of premium rate increases at the end of the period 
we do not pay commissions on the portion of collected premiums related to premium rate increases 
as a result  commission ratios are reduced 
in addition  during  we experienced the sale of a greater portion of higher risk policies that generally have a higher premium and reduced or no renewal commission structure 
the reduced commission ratio in the period is  in part  due to the impact of these policies being renewed 
net policy acquisition costs amortized deferred 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs in the period increased to a net amortization of costs of  compared to  in the period 
deferred costs are typically all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of new premiums 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commissions less ultimate renewal commissions  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy sales  underwriting and issuance 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event that a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the net amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is affected by new business generation  imputed interest on prior reserves and policy persistency 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premium generation 
however  lower new premium sales during the period produced significantly less expense deferral to offset amortized costs 
we regularly assess the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than current unamortized deferred acquisition costs  the unamortized amount is deemed recoverable 
in the event recoverability is not demonstrated  we reassess the calculation using justifiable premium rate increases 
if rate increases are not received or are deemed unjustified  we will expense  as impaired  the attributed portion of the deferred asset in the current period 
if we conclude that the deferred acquisition costs are impaired  we will record an impairment loss and a reduction in the deferred acquisition cost asset 
in the event of an impairment  we will also evaluate our historical assumptions utilized in establishing the policy reserves and deferred acquisition costs and may update those assumptions to reflect current experience referred to as unlocking 
the primary assumptions include persistency  claims expectations  interest rates and rate increases 
during the period  we determined to recognize a dac impairment charge of  primarily as a result of the incorporation of certain assumptions related to the future profitability of our current business in force 
these assumptions included the use of a lower discount rate  which reflects the current interest rate environment  higher anticipated claims costs due to newly estimated claim duration and reasonable expected future premium rate increases on policies for which we have already filed or anticipate filing 
in the event that premium rate increases cannot be obtained as needed  or our actual experience differs from our assumptions  our dac could be further impaired and we would incur an expense in the amount of the impairment 
during  we recognized an impairment of our deferred acquisition costs of approximately  effective december   we entered into a reinsurance agreement covering substantially all of our long term care policies 
the reinsurance agreement includes an annual expense and risk charge  which the reinsurer credits against our experience account 
since we anticipate that we will commute the reinsurance agreement  we include these expenses in our future profit analysis 
the reduction in the anticipated future gross profits resulting from the expense and risk charges was the primary factor causing the impairment of the deferred acquisition costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
the ratio of total general and administrative expenses to premium revenues was in the period  compared to in the period 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
see new accounting principles  expenses were reduced by  due to the cessation of goodwill amortization 
certain expenses have declined as a result of reduced new premium sales  related underwriting and policy issuance expenses and management initiatives to reduce operating expenses 
expense and risk charges on reinsurance and excise tax expense 
our reinsurance agreement provides the reinsurer with annual expense and risk charges  which are credited against our experience account in the event of future commutation of the agreement 
the annual charge consists of a fixed cost and a variable component based upon reserve and capital levels needed to support the reinsured business 
in the period  we incurred a charge of  for this charge 
in addition  we are subject to an excise tax for premium payments made to a foreign reinsurer 
we recorded  for excise tax expenses in the period and recorded  in the period in connection with the effective date of the agreement 
the excise tax is equal to one percent of premiums ceded to the foreign reinsurer 
provision for federal income taxes 
as a result of current losses  our provision for federal income taxes for the period decreased to an income tax benefit of  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the period 
the effective tax rate of in the and periods is below the normal federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the tax exempt nature of income from our investments in corporate owned life insurance

we recognized an impairment loss of  in the period as a result of our transitional impairment test of goodwill

parent company operations we have successfully engaged in activities  including issuance of both debt and equity securities  over the past three years to fund our liquidity and subsidiary capital needs 
these activities have included in april  we distributed rights to our shareholders and holders of our convertible subordinated notes due rights offering for the purpose of raising new equity capital 
pursuant to the rights offering  holders of our common stock and holders of our convertible subordinated notes received rights to purchase  newly issued shares of common stock at a set price of per share 
the rights offering was completed on may  and generated net proceeds of  in additional equity capital 
we contributed  of the net proceeds to the statutory capital of our subsidiaries 
in march  we completed a private placement of shares of common stock for net proceeds of  the common stock was sold to several current and new institutional investors at per share 
the offering price was a percent discount to the day average price of our common stock prior to the issuance of the new shares 
we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on june  to register these shares for resale 
in june  we completed a private placement of shares of common stock as compensation to our financial advisor 
we filed a registration statement for of these additional shares with the securities and exchange commission on june  in november and january  we completed an additional private placement of and shares of common stock  respectively  to the same financial advisor 
in september  we commenced an offer to exchange our then outstanding  convertible subordinated notes due the notes  which were due to mature in and had a conversion price of for a like amount of new notes due the notes 
the notes carried terms similar to the notes but mature in october and would be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 
prior to the termination of the exchange offer  we reduced the conversion price to  then  and ultimately in february in addition  beginning in october  the notes are mandatorily convertible if  at any time  the day average closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price 
we exchanged approximately  of the notes for notes 
we retired the outstanding  of the notes in june in december  we commenced the sale of up to  in additional notes 
in the first quarter of  we completed the sale of notes and received proceeds of  we used  of the proceeds to satisfy the premium to surplus requirements of our voluntary consent order with the florida insurance department 
we used the remaining proceeds to supplement parent liquidity  retire our remaining notes  and for general working capital purposes 
in conjunction with the new issuance  we modified the terms of all of our notes to provide holders of the notes incentive to convert their notes into shares of our common stock prior to october by offering to pay interest that would have otherwise been received from the date of conversion until october the interest amount  which is discounted from october to the date of early conversion  is payable at our discretion in cash or in shares of our common stock  discounted by from the prevailing market rate of our shares 
during  holders of  of our notes elected to convert their notes for  shares of our common stock 
in addition to the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes  we issued these holders shares of common stock as payment of discounted interest between the date of conversion and october subsequent to december   we issued an additional  in notes 
we intend to use the proceeds to supplement parent liquidity  for general working capital purposes and to further supplement our subsidiaries statutory surplus 
since december   holders of  of our notes elected to convert their notes for  shares of our common stock

cash flow needs of penn treaty primarily include interest payments on outstanding debt and operating expenses 
the funding is primarily derived from the operating cash flow of our agency subsidiary operations and dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
however  as noted above  the dividend capabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are limited and we may need to rely upon the dividend capabilities of our agency subsidiaries to meet current liquidity needs 
we believe that our current cash on hand and these sources of funds will be sufficient to service our debt obligations through at least april  and potentially through october   which is dependent upon our parent company expenses and liquidity  agency dividend capabilities or our subsidiary surplus needs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient funds through operations or raise additional capital to meet our debt service obligations on or after october  or if our assumptions about our ability to service our debt prior to are not correct  we may default on our debt obligations 
we will need to raise additional capital to satisfy any parent company liquidity needs  including debt service payments  beyond october  particularly if the price of our common stock on or after october  is insufficient to cause mandatory conversion of our notes

the national association of insurance commissioners naic has risk based capital rbc requirements for insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks  such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that an insurer must maintain 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which may require specific corrective action depending upon the insurer s state of domicile 
our insurance subsidiaries  ptna  anic  and ainic representing approximately  and of our direct in force premium  respectively are required to hold statutory surplus that is above a certain required level 
at december   ptna had total adjusted capital at the regulatory action level  which required it to file a plan with the department 
anic is also subject to the plan because it is owned by ptna 
on february   the department approved the plan 
as a primary component of the plan  effective december   ptna and anic entered a reinsurance transaction to reinsure  on a quota share basis  substantially all of our long term care insurance policies then in force 
the agreement is subject to certain coverage limitations  including an aggregate limit of liability that is a function of certain factors and that may be reduced in the event that the rate increases that the reinsurance agreement may require are not obtained 
we are required to perform annual comparisons of our actual to expected claims experience 
if we have reason to believe  whether from this analysis or other available information  that at least a premium rate increase is necessary  we are obligated to file and obtain such premium rate increases in order to comply with the requirements of the agreement 
if we do not file and obtain such premium rate increases  our aggregate limit of liability would be reduced by of the premium amount that would have otherwise been received 
as part of this agreement  annual risk charges in excess of  are assessed against our experience account by the reinsurer 
the annual amount increases if we do not commute before january  this agreement meets the requirements to qualify for reinsurance treatment under statutory accounting rules 
however  this agreement does not qualify for reinsurance treatment in accordance with gaap because  the agreement does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss 
this is due to a number of factors related to the agreement  including experience refund provisions  the expense and risk charges credited to the experience account by the reinsurer and the aggregate limit of liability 
the initial premium of the treaties was approximately  comprised of  of cash and qualified securities transferred in february  and  as funds held due to the reinsurer 
the initial premium and future cash flows from the reinsured policies  less claims payments  ceding commissions and risk charges  is credited to a notional experience account  which is held for our benefit in the event of commutation and recapture on or after december  the notional experience account balance receives an investment credit based upon the total return from a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges that are intended to match the duration of our reserve liability 
our current modeling and actuarial projections suggest that we are likely to be able to commute the agreement  as planned  on december  in order to commute the agreement  our statutory capital following commutation must be sufficient to support the reacquired business in compliance with all statutory requirements 
upon commutation  we would receive cash or other liquid assets equaling the market value of our experience account from the reinsurer 
we would also record the necessary reserves for the business in our statutory financial statements 
our ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the market value of the notional experience account exceeding the level of required reserves to be established 
in addition to the performance of the reinsured policies from now until  the notional experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current notional experience account by approximately  and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our notional experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the notional experience account balance prior to commutation 
we intend to give notice to the reinsurer of our intention to commute on december  at such time as we are highly confident of our ability to support the reacquired policies 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the notional experience account at that time  and to then invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility 
as part of our reinsurance agreement  effective december   the reinsurer was granted four tranches of warrants to purchase shares of non voting convertible preferred stock 
the first three tranches of warrants are exercisable through and expire on december  at common stock equivalent prices ranging from approximately to per share 
if exercised  the convertible preferred stock would represent  if converted  approximately of the then outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis 
if the agreement is not commuted on december   the reinsurer may exercise the fourth tranche of convertible preferred stock purchase warrants at a common stock equivalent price of per share 
if the fourth tranche of warrants was exercised  the convertible preferred stock  if converted  would represent an additional of the then outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
no assurance can be given that the reinsurer will exercise any or all of the warrants granted or that it will pay cash in connection with their exercise 
as a result of our intention to commute  we assessed only the expense and risk credits anticipated prior to the commutation date in our most recent dac recoverability analyses and are not recording the potential of future escalating charges in our current financial statements 
in addition  we are recognizing the up front costs of entering into the agreement  including the fair value of the warrants granted to the reinsurer  over the period of time to the expected commutation date 
in the event we determine that commutation of the reinsurance agreement is unlikely on december   but likely at some future date  we will include additional annual expense risk charge credits against our experience account in our dac recoverability analysis 
as a result  we could impair the value of our dac asset and record the impairment in our financial statements 
however  we currently believe that we will have a sufficient amount of statutory capital and surplus to do so by december  or that sufficient alternatives  such as additional capital issuance or new reinsurance opportunities  are available to enable us to commute the agreement as planned 
the reinsurance agreement also granted the reinsurer an option to participate in reinsuring new business sales on a quota share basis 
in august  the reinsurer exercised its option to reinsure up to of future sales  subject to a limitation of the reinsurer s risk 
the reinsurer may continue this level of participation on the next million in new policy premium issued after january  the final agreement  which was entered into in december  further provides the reinsurer the option to reinsure a portion of the next billion in newly issued long term care annual insurance premium  subject to maximum quota share amounts of up to as additional policies are written 
this agreement does not qualify for reinsurance treatment in accordance with gaap because  the agreement does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss 
this is due to an aggregate limit of liability that reduces the likelihood of the reinsurer realizing a significant loss on the agreement 
however  this agreement meets the requirements to qualify for reinsurance treatment under statutory accounting rules 
in february  the reinsurer notified us that it may  for reasons unrelated to us  discontinue its quota share reinsurance of new long term care insurance policies issued on or after an unspecified future date 
the company s separate agreement with the reinsurer to reinsure existing policies issued prior to december  will be unaffected by any determination made by the reinsurer regarding newly issued policies 
on march   the reinsurer notified us verbally of its decision to cease reinsuring newly issued policies on or about august l  under any of our agreements with the reinsurer will be unaffected by the termination of this agreement 
upon the department s approval of the plan in february  we recommenced new policy sales in states  including pennsylvania 
we have now recommenced new policy sales in additional states  including florida subject to a voluntary corrective order 
florida and pennsylvania accounted for approximately and  respectively of our direct premium revenue for the year ended december  we have recently agreed upon terms for the recommencement of sales in california  subject to certain continuing conditions and approval of our filed product forms and rates 
california renewal premiums represented approximately of our direct premium revenue for the year ended december  we are actively working with the remaining states to recommence new policy sales in all jurisdictions 
the plan requires us to comply with certain agreements at the direction of the department  including  but not limited to o new investments are limited to naic or rated securities 
o affiliated transactions are limited and require department approval 
o an agreement to increase statutory reserves by an additional  throughout  of which  remained at december  the reinsurance agreement has provided the capacity to accommodate this increase 
effective september   we determined to discontinue the sale nationally of all new long term care insurance policies until the plan was approved by the department 
the decision resulted from our concern about further depletion of statutory surplus from new sales prior to the completion and approval of the plan and from increasing concern regarding our status by many states in which we are licensed to conduct business 
the form of our cessation varied by state  ranging from no action to certificate suspensions 
the majority of our insurance subsidiaries cash flow results from our existing long term care policies  which have been ceded to the reinsurer under this agreement 
our subsidiaries ability to meet additional liquidity needs and cover fixed expenses in the future is highly dependent upon our ability to issue new policies and to control expense growth 
our future growth and new policy issuance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our historical markets  retain and expand our network of agents and effectively market our products and our ability to fund our marketing and expansion while maintaining minimum statutory levels of capital and surplus required to support such growth 
under the insurance laws of pennsylvania and new york  where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  insurance companies can pay ordinary dividends only out of earned surplus 
in addition  under pennsylvania law  our pennsylvania insurance subsidiaries including our primary insurance subsidiary must give the department at least days advance notice of any proposed extraordinary dividend and cannot pay such a dividend if the department disapproves the payment during that day period 
for purposes of that provision  an extraordinary dividend is a dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s surplus as shown on the company s last annual statement filed with department or its statutory net income as shown on that annual statement 
statutory earnings are generally lower than earnings reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles due to the immediate or accelerated recognition of all costs associated with premium growth and benefit reserves 
additionally  the plan requires the department to approve all dividend requests made by penn treaty network america  regardless of normal statutory requirements for allowable dividends 
we believe that the department is unlikely to consider any dividend request in the foreseeable future  as a result of penn treaty network america s current statutory surplus position 
although not stipulated in the plan  this requirement is likely to continue until such time as penn treaty meets normal statutory allowances  including reported net income and positive cumulative earned surplus 
we do not expect that this will occur in the foreseeable future 
under new york law  our new york insurance subsidiary american independent must give the new york insurance department days advance notice of any proposed dividend and cannot pay any dividend if the regulator disapproves the payment during that day period 
in addition  our new york insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the new york insurance department before paying any dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the lesser of of the insurance company s surplus as of the preceding december or its adjusted net investment income for the year ended the preceding december penn treaty network america insurance company and american network insurance company have not paid any dividends to penn treaty for the past three years and are unlikely in the foreseeable future to be able to make dividend payments due to insufficient statutory surplus and anticipated earnings 
however  our new york subsidiary is not subject to the plan and was permitted by new york statute to make a dividend payment following december  consequently  in  penn treaty received a dividend from our new york subsidiary of at december   our subsidiaries had no debt outstanding 
new accounting principles amounts in thousands in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
specifies that instruments within its scope embody obligations of the issuer and that  therefore  the issuer must classify them as liabilities 
sfas no 
represents phase one of the fasb s broader project on distinguishing between liability and equity instruments and accounting for instruments that have characteristics of both types of instruments 
sfas no 
covers a limited number of instruments that are to be classified as liabilities and is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the implementation of certain provisions related to mandatorily redeemable financial instruments has been deferred

sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and ceased amortizing goodwill at that time 
during the second quarter  we completed an impairment analysis of goodwill  in accordance with fasb no 
our goodwill was recorded as a result of the purchase of our agencies and our insurance subsidiaries 
as part of our evaluation  we completed numerous steps in determining the recoverability of our goodwill 
the first required step was the measurement of total enterprise fair value versus book value 
because our fair market value  as measured by our stock price  was below book value at january   goodwill was next evaluated at a reporting unit level  which comprised our insurance agencies and insurance subsidiaries 
upon completion of our evaluation  we determined that the goodwill associated with the agency purchases was fully recoverable 
the deficiency of current market value to book value was assigned to the insurance subsidiary values 
as a result  we determined that the goodwill associated with our insurance subsidiaries was impaired and recognized an impairment loss of  from our transitional impairment test of goodwill  which we recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the impairment has been recorded effective january  management has completed an assessment of other intangible assets and has determined to continue to amortize these assets so as to closely match the future profit emergence from these assets 
we complete an evaluation on an annual basis

the provisions related to the disclosure requirements to be made by a guarantor are effective for financial statements of interim and annual reporting periods ending after december  the provisions related to the recognition of a liability and initial measurement shall be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end

forward looking statements certain statements made by us in this report may be considered forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although we believe that our expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results of our operations will not differ materially from our expectations 
an investment in our securities includes certain risks  which may be specific to us or to the long term care insurance industry 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include  among others  our ability to comply with the corrective action plan  the florida consent order  the orders or directives of other states in which we do business or any special provisions imposed by states in connection with the resumption of writing new business  our ability to commute our reinsurance agreement and to recapture our reinsured policies and accumulated notional experience account balance  whether our corrective action plan will be accepted and approved by all states  our ability to meet our future risk based capital goals  the adverse financial impact of suspending new business sales  our ability to raise adequate capital to meet regulatory requirements and to support anticipated growth  our ability to refinance  convert or repay our convertible subordinated notes  the cost associated with recommencing new business sales  liquidity needs and debt obligations  the adequacy of our loss reserves and the recoverability of our dac asset  our ability to sell insurance products in certain states  including california  our ability to resume generating new business in all states  our ability to comply with government regulations and the requirements which may be imposed by state regulators as a result of our capital and surplus levels  the ability of senior citizens to purchase our products in light of the increasing costs of health care  our ability to defend ourselves against adverse litigation  and our ability to recapture  expand and retain our network of productive independent agents  especially in light of the suspension of new business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follow an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets 
a significant portion of assets and liabilities are financial instruments  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk on fixed rate domestic medium term instruments and  to a lesser extent  domestic short term and long term instruments 
we have established strategies  asset quality standards  asset allocations and other relevant criteria for our portfolio to manage our exposure to market risk 
at december  and  and until we retired our mortgage balance in october  we had an interest rate swap on our mortgage  which was used as a hedge to convert the mortgage to a fixed interest rate 
we believe that  since the notional amount of the swap was amortized at the same rate as the underlying mortgage and both financial instruments are with the same bank  no credit or financial risk was carried with the swap 
our financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
our portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers other than us treasury and agency obligations  industry segments or geographic regions 
however  our notional experience account balance  which represents a substantial portion of our investable assets at december   is with one reinsurer 
although sufficient assets to support our statutory reserve liabilities are secured by trust accounts and irrevocable letters of credit with major united states financial institutions  the accumulated profits of our reinsured business are susceptible to significant credit risk of the reinsurer 
we urge caution in evaluating overall market risk from the information below 
actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables are excluded in the hypothetical effects insurance liabilities represent of total liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses and the notional experience account due from reinsurer represent of total assets 
long term debt  although not carried at fair value  is included in the hypothetical effect calculation 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of our financial instruments including our notional experience account balance  as discussed below as of december   excluding insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses because such insurance related assets and liabilities are not carried at fair value  would have been as follows if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value of our investment portfolio less our long term debt 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by and basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value of our investment portfolio less our long term debt and the related swap agreement 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by and basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
effective december   we entered a reinsurance agreement to reinsure  on a quota share basis  substantially all of our long term care insurance policies in force 
the transaction resulted in the transfer of debt and equity securities of approximately million to the reinsurer 
the agreement provides us the opportunity to commute and recapture on or after december  to that end  the reinsurer will maintain a notional experience account for our benefit only in the event of commutation and recapture  which reflects the initial premium paid  future premiums collected net of claims  expenses and accumulated investment earnings 
the notional experience account balance will receive an investment credit based upon the total return of a series of benchmark indices and hedges that are designed to closely match the duration of reserve liabilities 
as a result  we will likely experience significant volatility in our future financial statements 
our ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the market value of the notional experience account exceeding the level of required reserves to be established 
in addition to the performance of the reinsured policies from now until  the notional experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current notional experience account by approximately million and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our notional experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the notional experience account balance prior to commutation 
we intend to give notice to the reinsurer of our intention to commute on december  at such time as we are highly confident of our ability to support the reacquired policies 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the notional experience account at that time  and to then invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility 
we hold certain mortgage and asset backed securities as part of our investment portfolio 
the fair value of these instruments may react in a convex or non linear fashion when subjected to interest rate increases or decreases 
the anticipated cash flows of these instruments may differ from expectations in changing interest rate environments  resulting in duration drift or a varying nature of predicted time weighted present values of cash flows 
the result of unpredicted cash flows from these investments could cause the above hypothetical estimates to change 
however  we believe that the minimal amount we have invested in these instruments and their broadly defined payment parameters sufficiently outweigh the cost of computer models necessary to accurately predict the possible impact on our investment income of hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments as of december
