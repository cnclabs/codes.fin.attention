the results of operations for premcor inc principally reflect the results of operations of prg  except for certain pipeline operations  general and administrative costs  interest income  and interest expense at stand alone premcor inc and or its other subsidiaries 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the results of operations and financial condition of premcor inc and subsidiaries and the discussions provided are equally applicable to premcor inc and prg except where indicated otherwise 
we are an independent petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels  heating oil  petrochemical feedstocks  petroleum coke and other petroleum products in the united states 
we own and operate three refineries with a combined crude oil throughput capacity of approximately  barrels per day  or bpd 
our refineries are located in port arthur  texas  memphis  tennessee  and lima  ohio 
we acquired our memphis refinery in march we sell petroleum products in the midwest  the gulf coast and the eastern and southeastern united states 
we sell our products on an unbranded basis to approximately  distributors and chain retailers through a combination of our own product distribution system and an extensive third party owned product distribution system  as well as in the spot market 
recent developments in in january  we announced our intention to purchase the assets of motiva enterprises llc s delaware city refining complex located in delaware city  delaware  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including execution of a definitive agreement and obtaining regulatory approvals 
there is no assurance we will enter into a definitive agreement or consummate the transaction 
the assets to be purchased include a heavy crude oil refinery capable of processing in excess of  barrels per day bpd  a  tons per day tpd petroleum coke gasification unit  a megawatt mw cogeneration facility  and related assets 
the asset purchase price is expected to be million  plus the value of petroleum inventories at closing 
we expect the inventories will be approximately million 
we expect to finance the purchase with equal parts equity and debt 
as part of the financing we are considering the assumption or refinancing of motiva s obligations associated with million of tax exempt bonds issued by the delaware economic development authority deda in connection with the gasification and cogeneration facilities 
our assumption of the tax exempt bonds would be subject to the consent of the deda and other parties involved in the financing 
there is also a contingent purchase provision that may result in an additional million payment per year up to a total of million over a three year period depending on the level of industry refining margins during that period  and a gasifier performance provision that may result in an additional million payment per year up to a total of million over a two year period depending on the achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility 
the delaware city refinery is a high conversion heavy crude oil refinery 
major process units include a crude unit  a fluid coking unit  a fluid catalytic cracking unit  a hydrocracking unit with a hydrogen plant  a continuous catalytic reformer  an alkylation unit  and several hydrotreating units 
primary products include regular and premium conventional and reformulated gasoline  low sulfur diesel  and home heating oil 
the refinery s production is sold in the us northeast via pipeline  barge  and truck distribution 
the refinery s petroleum coke production is sold to third parties or gasified to fuel the cogeneration facility  which is designed to supply electricity and steam to the refinery as well as outside electrical sales to third parties 

table of contents factors affecting comparability our results over the past three years have been affected by the following events  which must be understood in order to assess the comparability of our period to period financial performance and condition 
acquisition of the memphis refinery and related financings effective march   we completed the acquisition of the memphis  tennessee refinery and related supply and distribution assets from the williams companies  inc and certain of its subsidiaries  or williams 
the purchase price of million included million for the refinery  supply and distribution assets  approximately million for crude and product inventories  and approximately million in transaction fees 
the memphis refinery has a rated crude oil throughput capacity of  bpd but typically processes approximately  bpd 
the related assets include two truck loading racks  three petroleum terminals in the area  supporting pipeline infrastructure that transports both crude oil and refined products  use of crude oil tankage at st 
james  louisiana  and an megawatt power plant adjacent to the refinery 
the acquisition of the memphis refinery assets was accounted for using the purchase method  and the results of operations of these assets have been included in our results from the date of acquisition 
in the third quarter of  we adjusted the purchase price allocation based on independent appraisals and other evaluations 
the adjusted purchase price allocation is as follows premcor inc prg current assets property  plant  equipment accrued liabilities current portion of long term debt long term debt capital leases other long term liabilities total purchase price allocation integration costs expenditures for refinery acquisition as part of the purchase agreement  we assumed liabilities of million that related to capital lease obligations  cancellation fees related to tier technology that we will not utilize  and environmental remediation activity 
williams assigned several leases to us including two capitalized leases that relate to the leasing of crude oil and product pipelines that are within the memphis refinery system connecting the refinery to storage facilities and other third party pipelines 
both capital leases have year terms with approximately years of their terms remaining 
the purchase agreement also provides for contingent participation  or earn out  payments up to a maximum aggregate of million to williams over the next seven years  depending on the level of industry refining margins during that period 
the earn out payments will be calculated annually at the end of the seven month periods beginning on april  the annual earn out calculation will be equal to one half of the excess of the actual daily value of the gulf coast crack spread over a stipulated margin level  at a crude oil throughput rate of  bpd 
the stipulated margin level is per barrel for the first year and increases by per barrel for each year thereafter 
the actual daily value of the gulf coast crack spread  as defined by the agreement  averaged per barrel for the nine month period from april  through december  any amounts we pay to williams as a result of the earn out agreement will be recorded as goodwill 
as of december   we recorded million in goodwill related to the earn out agreement  which reflected an estimate of our april  payment 
such goodwill will not be amortized  but will be subject to an annual impairment evaluation 

table of contents prg acquired the refinery and related assets utilizing a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of million in senior notes and utilizing capital contributions from premcor inc  which were funded from the proceeds of a public and private offering of common stock 
certain of the memphis pipeline assets and related liabilities were acquired or assumed by the premcor pipeline co  an indirect subsidiary of premcor inc prg also amended and restated its credit agreement to allow for the acquisition 
see liquidity and capital resources cash flows from financing activities for additional details of the financings 
stock based compensation expense we have three stock based employee compensation plans 
prior to  we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted in and earlier had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  prospectively  for all employee awards granted and modified after january  with respect to stock option grants outstanding as of december   we will record future non cash stock based compensation expense and additional paid in capital of million over the applicable vesting periods of the grants 
refinery restructuring and other charges in  we recorded refinery restructuring and other charges of million  which included a million charge related to closure costs and asset write offs related to the sale of certain hartford refinery assets and the blue island refinery closure  a million charge related to environmental remediation and litigation costs associated with closed and previously owned facilities  and a net million charge related to our planned closure of the st 
louis administrative office 
these activities and transactions are described more fully below 
in  we recorded refinery restructuring and other charges of million million for prg  which consisted of a million charge related to the ceasing of refinery operations at our hartford  illinois refinery  million charge related to the management  refinery operations  and administrative restructuring  a million charge related to the termination of certain guarantees at pacc as part of the sabine restructuring  a million charge related to idled assets  and a million charge related to the write down of premcor inc s interest in clark retail enterprises  inc  or cre  partially offset by a benefit of million related to the unanticipated sale of a portion of previously written off blue island refinery assets 
in  we recorded refinery restructuring and other charges of million  which consisted of a million charge related to the closure of our blue island  illinois refinery and a million charge related to the write off of idled coker units at our port arthur refinery 
the write off of the port arthur coker units included a charge of million related to the net asset value of the idled cokers and a charge of million for future environmental clean up costs related to the coker unit site 
below are further discussions of the hartford and blue island refinery closures and the management  refinery  and administrative function restructurings 
refinery closures and asset sale 
in late september  we ceased refining operations at our hartford refinery after concluding there was no economically viable method of reconfiguring the refinery to produce fuels meeting new gasoline and diesel fuel specifications mandated by the federal government 
the closure resulted in a pretax charge of million in  which included a million non cash  write down of long lived assets to their estimated fair value of million  a million non cash write down of current assets  a million charge related to employee severance  plant closure equipment remediation  and site clean up and environmental matters  and a million charge related to post retirement benefits that were extended to certain employees who were nearing the retirement requirements 
in january  we ceased refining operations at our 
table of contents blue island  illinois refinery 
this closure resulted in a pretax charge of million in  which included a million non cash write down of long lived and current assets and a million liability for employee severance and plant closure equipment remediation  and site clean up environmental matters 
employee severance and plant closure decommissioning activities have been completed at both sites 
we continue to utilize our storage and distribution facilities at both refinery sites 
in  we sold certain of the processing units and ancillary assets at the hartford refinery to conocophillips for million 
we have also entered into agreements with conocophillips to integrate certain of our remaining facilities with the assets they purchased from us and to receive from and provide to conocophillips certain services on an on going basis 
the million charge in primarily related to the sale transaction and subsequent agreements and included the write down of the refinery assets held for sale  the write off of certain storage and distribution assets included in property  plant and equipment  and certain other costs of the sale 
in the future  we expect the only significant effect on cash flows related to our closed refinery facilities will result from the environmental site remediation at both sites and equipment dismantling at our blue island site 
we are currently in discussions with governmental agencies concerning remediation programs for both sites and anticipate that the discussions will likely lead to final consent orders 
we expect a consent order setting forth the agreement for remediation of the blue island site to have been filed with the court in the first half of our site clean up and environmental liability takes into account costs that are reasonably foreseeable at this time 
as the site remediation plans are finalized and work is performed  further adjustments of the liability may be necessary and such adjustments may be material 
in  we recorded a charge of million related to our environmental remediation activity 
this charge included estimated survey  design  and clean up costs in relation to the village of hartford  costs related to the default of a third party to provide certain dismantling activity at our blue island site  and revised estimates for remediation activity at a previously owned terminal that resulted from further analysis of the site in in  we obtained environmental risk insurance policies covering the blue island refinery site 
this insurance program allows us to quantify and  within the limits of the policies  cap our cost to remediate the site  and provide insurance coverage from future third party claims arising from past or future environmental releases 
the remediation cost overrun policy has a term of ten years and  subject to certain exceptions and exclusions  provides million in coverage in excess of a self insured retention amount of million 
the pollution legal liability policy provides for million in aggregate coverage and per incident coverage in excess of a  deductible 
we believe this program also provides governmental agencies financial assurance that  once begun  remediation of the site will be completed in a timely and prudent manner 
management  refinery operations and administrative restructuring 
in  we restructured our executive management team resulting in the recognition of severance expense of million and non cash stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million for the cancellation of a monitoring agreement with one of our common stock owners 
see related party transactions blackstone for more details of the agreement 
in the second quarter of  we commenced a restructuring of our st 
louis based general and administrative operations and recorded a charge of million for severance  outplacement and other restructuring expenses relating to the elimination of hourly and salaried positions 
in the third quarter of  we announced plans to reduce our non represented workforce at our port arthur  texas and lima  ohio refineries and make additional staff reductions at our st 
louis administrative office 
we recorded a charge of million for severance  outplacement  and other restructuring expenses relating to the elimination of hourly and salaried positions 
included in this charge was million related to post retirement benefits that were extended to certain employees who were nearing the retirement requirements 
reductions at the refineries occurred in october and those at the st 
louis office occurred in as a result of the memphis refinery acquisition  the number of positions to be eliminated at the st 
louis office was reduced by and we recorded a reduction in the restructuring liability of million in the first 
table of contents quarter of in may  we announced that we would be closing the st 
louis office and moving the administrative functions to the connecticut office over the next twelve months 
the office move is expected to cost million  which includes million of severance related benefits and million of other costs such as training  relocation  and the movement of physical assets 
the severance related costs will be amortized over the future service period of the affected employees and the other costs will be expensed as incurred 
the following table summarizes the expected expenses associated with the administrative restructuring and provides a reconciliation of the administrative restructuring liability as of december  in millions severance other costs total costs summary of restructuring expenses expected total restructuring expenses expenses recorded this year cumulative expenses recorded to date liability activity beginning balance  december  expenses recorded this year adjustments cash outflows ending balance  december  extinguishment of long term debt in  we redeemed the remaining principal balance of our subordinated debentures  repaid our million floating rate loan  redeemed the outstanding balances of our senior subordinated notes  senior notes  and senior notes  purchased in the open market a portion of pacc s senior notes  and amended our credit agreement in conjunction with the memphis acquisition 
we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long term debt of million  which included cash premiums associated with the early repayment of long term debt of million  a write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of million related to this debt and the amended credit agreement  and a write off of unamortized note discounts of million 
prg recorded a loss on extinguishment of long term debt of million which excluded the cash premium paid in relation to the redemption of subordinated debentures  which were held by prg s parent company 
in  we redeemed the outstanding balances of our senior notes  senior notes  senior secured bank loan  and purchased a portion of our subordinated debentures 
we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long term debt of million related to these early repayments 
the loss included premiums associated with the early repayment of long term debt of million  a write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to this debt of million  and the write off of a prepaid premium for an insurance policy guaranteeing the interest and principal payments on sabine s long term debt of million 
related to the redemption of the senior notes and the repayment of the senior secured bank loan  prg recorded a loss of million  of which million related to premiums  million related to the write off of deferred financing costs  and million related to the write off of debt guarantee fees at sabine 
in  we repurchased in the open market portions of our senior notes  senior notes and exchangeable preferred stock 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded a gain of million  which included discounts of million offset by the write off of deferred financing costs related to the notes 
prg recorded a gain of million  which included a discount of million offset by the write off of deferred financing costs related to the repurchase of a portion of the senior notes 

table of contents discontinued operations in connection with the sale of our retail assets to clark retail enterprises  inc  or cre  we assigned approximately leases and subleases of retail stores to cre 
subject to certain defenses  we remain jointly and severally liable for cre s obligations under approximately of these leases  including payment of rent and taxes 
we may also be contingently liable for environmental obligations at these sites 
in october  cre and its parent company  clark retail group  inc  filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
in bankruptcy hearings throughout  cre rejected  and subject to certain defenses  we became primarily obligated for  approximately of the previously assigned leases 
during the third quarter of  cre conducted an orderly sale of its remaining retail assets  including most of the leases and subleases previously assigned by us to cre except those that were rejected by cre 
we recorded an after tax charge of million in  representing the estimated net present value of our remaining liability under the rejected leases  net of the sublease income  and other direct costs 
the primary obligation under the non rejected leases and subleases was transferred in the cre sale process to various unrelated third parties  however  we will likely remain jointly and severally liable on the assigned leases and the remaining unassigned leases could be rejected 
total payments on leases and subleases upon which we will likely remain jointly and severally liable are currently estimated as follows in millions     and in the aggregate thereafter we recorded a liability for the estimated cost of environmental remediation of our former retail store sites 
a portion of this liability was established pursuant to an indemnity agreement with cre in connection with its purchase of our retail assets 
this indemnity obligation does not extend to the buyers of cre s retail assets and  as a result  we will review our environmental liability accordingly upon the final disposition of the cre bankruptcy 
the following table reconciles the activity and balance of the liability for the lease obligations as well as our environmental liability for previously owned and leased retail sites lease obligations environmental obligations of previously owned and leased sites total discontinued operations beginning balance  december  net present value of lease obligations accretion and other expenses net cash outlays ending balance  december  in  we recorded an additional pretax charge of million  or million net of income taxes  related to the environmental and other liabilities of some of our previously owned retail sites 
this charge represents an increase in estimate regarding our environmental clean up obligation and workers compensation liability and a decrease in the amount of reimbursements for environmental expenditures that are collectible from state agencies under various programs 
the changes in estimates were prompted by the availability of new information concerning site by site clean up plans  changing postures of state regulatory agencies  and fluctuations in the amounts available under state reimbursement programs 
factors affecting operating results our earnings and cash flow from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks 
the cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of refined products ultimately sold depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including the supply of  and demand for  crude oil  gasoline and other refined products which  in turn  depend on  among other factors  changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of competitive fuels  product pipeline capacity  and the extent of government regulation 
while our net sales and operating revenues fluctuate significantly with 
table of contents movements in industry refined product prices  such prices do not generally have a direct long term relationship to net earnings 
crude oil price movements may impact net earnings in the short term because of fixed price crude oil purchase commitments 
the effect of changes in crude oil prices on our operating results is influenced by how the prices of refined products adjust to reflect such changes 
crude oil and other feedstock costs and the price of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuation 
expansion of existing facilities and installation of additional refinery crude distillation and upgrading facilities  price volatility  international political and economic developments and other factors beyond our control are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics 
these factors can impact  among other things  the level of inventories in the market resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins 
moreover  the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products  such as for gasoline during the summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter  primarily in the northeast 
in order to assess our operating performance  we compare our gross margin net sales and operating revenue less cost of sales against an industry gross margin benchmark 
the industry gross margin is based on a crack spread 
for example  one such crack spread is calculated by assuming that two barrels of benchmark light sweet crude oil are converted  or cracked  into one barrel of conventional gasoline and one barrel of high sulfur diesel fuel 
this is referred to as the crack spread 
we calculate the benchmark margin using the market value of us gulf coast gasoline and diesel fuel against the market value of west texas intermediate crude oil and refer to that benchmark as the gulf coast crack spread  or simply  the gulf coast crack spread 
the gulf coast crack spread is expressed in dollars per barrel and is a proxy for the per barrel margin that a sweet crude oil refinery situated on the gulf coast would earn assuming it produced and sold the benchmark production of conventional gasoline and high sulfur diesel fuel 
we utilize the gulf coast crack spread as a benchmark for our port arthur and memphis refinery operations 
we utilize the chicago crack spread as a benchmark for our lima refinery operations 
our actual results will vary as our crude oil and product slates differ from the benchmarks and for other ancillary costs that are not included in the benchmarks  such as crude oil and product grade differentials  transportation costs  storage and credit fees  inventory fluctuations and price risk management activities 
as explained below  each of our refineries  depending on market conditions  has certain feedstock cost and or product value advantages and disadvantages as compared to the benchmark 
our port arthur refinery is able to process significant quantities of sour and heavy sour crude oil that has historically cost less than west texas intermediate crude oil 
we measure the cost advantage of heavy sour crude oil by calculating the spread between the value of maya crude oil  a heavy crude oil produced in mexico  to the value of west texas intermediate crude oil  a light crude oil 
we use maya crude oil for this measurement because a significant amount of our heavy sour crude oil throughput is maya 
we measure the cost advantage of sour crude oil by calculating the spread between the throughput value of west texas sour crude oil to the value of west texas intermediate crude oil 
in addition  since we are able to source both domestic pipeline crude oil and foreign tanker crude oil to our refineries  the value of foreign crude oil relative to domestic crude oil is also an important factor affecting our operating results 
since many foreign crude oils other than maya are priced relative to the market value of a benchmark north sea crude oil known as dated brent  we also measure the cost advantage of foreign crude oil by calculating the spread between the value of dated brent crude oil to the value of west texas intermediate crude oil 
we have crude oil supply contracts that provide for our purchase of up to approximately  bpd of crude oil from pmi comercio international  sa de cv  an affiliate of petroleos mexicanos  the mexican state oil company  or pemex 
one of these contracts is a long term agreement  under which we currently purchase approximately  bpd of maya crude oil  designed to provide us with a stable and secure supply of maya crude oil 
an important feature of this agreement is a price adjustment mechanism designed to minimize the effect of adverse refining margin cycles and to moderate the fluctuations of the coker gross margin  a benchmark measure of the value of coker production over the cost of coker feedstocks 
this price adjustment mechanism contains a formula that represents an approximation of the coker gross margin and provides for a minimum average coker margin of per barrel over the first eight years of the agreement  which began on april  
table of contents the agreement expires in for purposes of comparison  the per barrel minimum average coker gross margin support amount equates to a wti maya crude oil differential of approximately per barrel using ten year historical market prices  which slightly exceeded actual market differentials during that period 
on a monthly basis  the coker gross margin  as defined under this agreement  is calculated and compared to the minimum 
coker gross margins exceeding the minimum are considered a surplus while coker gross margins that fall short of the minimum are considered a shortfall 
on a quarterly basis  the surplus and shortfall determinations since the beginning of the contract are aggregated 
pricing adjustments to the crude oil we purchase is only made when there exists a cumulative shortfall 
when this quarterly aggregation first reveals that a cumulative shortfall exists  we receive a discount on our crude oil purchases in the next quarter in the amount of the cumulative shortfall 
if thereafter  the cumulative shortfall incrementally increases  we receive additional discounts on our crude oil purchases in the succeeding quarter equal to the incremental increase 
conversely  if thereafter  the cumulative shortfall incrementally decreases  we repay discounts previously received  or a premium  on our crude oil purchases in the succeeding quarter equal to the incremental decrease 
cash crude oil discounts received by us in any one quarter are limited to million  while our repayment of previous crude oil discounts  or premiums  is limited to million in any one quarter 
any amounts subject to the quarterly payment limitations are carried forward and applied in subsequent quarters 
as of december   a cumulative quarterly surplus of million existed under the contract 
as a result  to the extent that we experience quarterly shortfalls in coker gross margins going forward  the price we pay for maya crude oil in succeeding quarters will not be discounted until this cumulative surplus is offset by future shortfalls 
we acquire directly or through morgan stanley capital group  or mscg  as an intermediary the majority of the remainder of our crude oil supply on the spot market from unaffiliated foreign and domestic sources  allowing us to be flexible in our crude oil supply source 
we have entered into a crude oil supply agreement with mscg through which we can arrange to purchase foreign or domestic crude oils in quantities sufficient to fulfill the crude oil requirements of the memphis refinery 
under terms of this supply agreement  we must either cash fund crude oil purchases one week in advance of delivery or provide security to mscg in the form of a letter of credit 
availability of crude supply is not guaranteed under this arrangement 
we rely solely on the spot crude oil market for supply and have the ability to arrange purchases through mscg 
the benefit of the mscg arrangement is that it provides payment and credit terms that are generally more favorable to us than normal industry terms 
this supply agreement with mscg expires in february  and can be renewed based on certain notification requirements 
the sales value of our production is also an important consideration in understanding our results 
we produce a high volume of premium products  such as premium and reformulated gasoline  low sulfur diesel fuel  jet fuel  and petrochemical products that carry a sales value higher than that for the products used to calculate the gulf coast crack spread 
in addition  products produced by our lima refinery are generally of higher value than similar products produced on the gulf coast due to the fact that the midwest consumes more product than it produces  thereby creating a competitive advantage for midwest refiners that can produce and deliver refined products at a cost lower than importers of refined product into the region 
this advantage is measured by the excess of the chicago crack spread over the gulf coast crack spread 
our memphis refinery also benefits from location premiums for refined products 
another important factor affecting operating results is the relative quantity of higher value transportation fuels and petrochemical products compared to the production of residual fuel oil and other by products such as petroleum coke and sulfur 
our lima and memphis refineries produce a product slate that is of higher value than the products used to calculate the crack spreads 
our lima and memphis refineries benefit from mid continental locations  in addition to the fact that they produce a greater percentage of high value transportation fuels as a result of processing a predominantly sweet crude oil slate 
in contrast to our lima and memphis refineries  approximately of port arthur s product slate is lower value petroleum coke  sulfur  and residual oils  which 
table of contents negatively impacts the refinery s gross margin against the benchmark crack spread 
less than of the product slate at lima and memphis is the lower value residual oils or petroleum coke 
our operating cost structure is also important to our profitability 
major operating costs include costs relating to energy  employee and contract labor  maintenance  and environmental compliance 
the predominant variable cost is energy and the most important benchmark for energy costs is the value of natural gas 
the nature of our business leads us to maintain a substantial investment in petroleum inventories 
since petroleum feedstocks and products are essentially commodities  we have no control over the changing market value of our investment 
our inventory investment includes both titled inventory and fixed price purchase and sale commitments 
because our titled inventory is valued under the last in  first out inventory costing method  price fluctuations on our titled inventory have very little effect on our financial results unless the market value of our titled inventory is reduced below cost 
although benchmark market indicators such as the gulf coast and chicago are useful in predicting refining gross margin  changes in absolute hydrocarbon prices  the structure of the hydrocarbon futures market and our specific price risk mitigation activities have an effect on our results that does not correlate with the benchmark market indicators 
in order to supply our refineries with crude oil on a timely basis  we enter into purchase contracts that fix the price of crude oil from one to several weeks in advance of receiving and processing that crude oil 
in addition  it is common as part of our marketing activities to fix the price of a portion of our product sales in advance of producing and delivering that refined product 
prior to delivery of the related crude oil and production of the related refined products  these fixed price purchase and sale commitments will change in value as prices rise and fall 
our results are measured by recording these commitments at market value 
with the acquisition of our memphis refinery and the related increase in our domestic crude oil requirements  the average level of our open fixed price purchase commitments is approximately million barrels as of december  since the average level of our open fixed price sale commitments is approximately million barrels  on a net basis  we carry an average level of open fixed price purchase commitments of approximately million barrels 
as a result  a per barrel increase in absolute price levels increases the value of our net fixed price purchase commitments and our pretax operating results by approximately million 
a per barrel decline in absolute price levels would produce the opposite effect 
to mitigate the absolute price risk while holding these fixed price purchase and sale commitments  we may purchase futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  that correspond volumetrically with all or a portion of our fixed price purchase and sale commitments 
these futures contracts are normally held in the current  or prompt  contract month on the nymex in order to achieve the best correlation with the change in the value of the fixed price commitment 
as prices change  the effect of the change on the value of the futures contract tends to offset the effect of the change on the value of the fixed price commitment 
since the volumetric level of our fixed price commitments is a net purchase and is relatively constant  to mitigate price risk it is typical to carry an offsetting net short futures position 
since this net short futures position is held in the prompt contract month on the nymex  it is necessary to exchange the prompt month nymex futures contract for the following month contract prior to its expiration 
when the contract price of the following month contract is less than the contract price of the prompt month contract a backwardated market structure  a loss is realized on the exchange as the prompt month contract is purchased at a value higher than the following month contract is sold 
when the contract price of the following month contract is greater than the contract price of the prompt month contract a contango market structure  the converse is true and a gain is realized on the exchange 
also affecting our operating results is the safety  reliability and the environmental performance of our refinery operations 
unplanned downtime of our refinery assets generally results in lost margin opportunity  increased maintenance expense and a temporary increase in working capital investment and related inventory position 
if we choose to hedge the incremental inventory position  we are subject to market and other risks normally associated with hedging activities 
the financial impact of planned downtime  such as major turnaround maintenance  is mitigated through a diligent planning process that considers such things as margin environment  availability of resources to perform the needed maintenance and feedstock logistics

see note to the consolidated financial statements in item to this annual report on form k for additional information on the prior period reclassifications 
gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to  million in from million in the increase in gross margin in was principally driven by significantly stronger market conditions including stronger crack spreads and crude oil differentials 
these market benefits were partially offset by the effects on our price risk management activities of an extremely volatile and backwardated hydrocarbon market in the first half of average crack spreads and crude oil differentials were stronger in as compared to the gulf coast and chicago crack spreads were approximately and higher  respectively  in than in the crack spreads were volatile in  but  we believe  were positively affected during due to low product inventory levels  the effects from the northeastern black out in august  and the strong gasoline demand during the summer driving season 
the wti less maya and wti less wts crude oil differentials were approximately and higher  respectively  in than in in  we believe the crude oil differentials were impacted by the overall volatility of the crude oil market  which we believe was affected by  among other things  crude supply concerns related to the war with iraq  workers strikes in venezuela  and political turmoil in nigeria 
a strong heavy sour and sour crude oil differential has a significant positive impact on port arthur s gross margin because its crude oil throughput is approximately heavy sour crude oil and approximately light and medium sour crude oils 
our lima and memphis refineries partially benefited from the stronger wti less dated brent crude oil differential as a portion of their crude oil in was purchased in the foreign market 
during  absolute hydrocarbon prices were volatile and at historically high levels  and the market structure for crude oil was significantly backwardated  until easing considerably in the third quarter 
in order to protect against the negative valuation effects of a possible precipitous decline in absolute price levels  we chose to carry net short nymex futures contracts to offset a portion of our net fixed purchase commitment price risk 
due to the backwardated crude oil market structure  this price risk mitigation strategy carried a cost as discussed in factors affecting our operating results 
including the effects of our price risk mitigation activities  our operating results in were negatively affected by approximately million from a decline in the value of our net fixed price purchase commitments 
by comparison  in  our operating results were principally affected by having our fixed price purchase commitments largely exposed to price risk early in year  but generally fully offset with net short nymex futures contracts beginning during the second quarter 
our operating results in benefited by approximately million from the change in the value of our net fixed price purchase commitments 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk for a description of our price risk management strategies and policies 
refinery operations port arthur refinery 
in  the average crude oil throughput rate at our port arthur refinery was approximately  bpd 
the rate was restricted due to a weakened margin environment at certain times during the year  a day planned turnaround maintenance of the hydrocracker unit in the third quarter  and a high crude oil purchasing environment throughout the year 
the crude oil throughput rate was regularly supplemented with more economic intermediate feedstocks in order to keep downstream units operating at full rates and to take advantage of the strong crack spreads 
otherwise  the crude oil throughput rates were at or above capacity and the refinery ran well 

table of contents in  the average crude oil throughput rate at our port arthur refinery was approximately  bpd 
in  our port arthur refinery experienced reduced crude oil throughput rates related to crude oil supply delays resulting from the impact of production and transportation interruptions caused by hurricanes isidore and lili and subsequent repairs on the reformer unit resulting from october s hurricane shutdown 
the port arthur refinery operations were also affected by the february shutdown of our coker unit for ten days for unplanned maintenance 
we took advantage of the coker outage to make repairs to the distillate and naphtha hydrotreaters  including turnaround maintenance that was originally planned for later in the year 
in january  we shut down the fluid catalytic cracking fcc unit  gas oil hydrotreating unit and sulfur plant for approximately days at our port arthur refinery for planned turnaround maintenance 
this turnaround maintenance did not affect crude oil throughput rates but did lower gasoline production 
we sold more unfinished products during the first quarter of due to this shutdown 
lima refinery 
in  the average crude oil throughput rate at our lima refinery was approximately  bpd 
the rate was restricted due to a scheduled maintenance turnaround of the isocracker unit in the fourth quarter and a planned maintenance turnaround of the fcc unit in the first quarter 
in the third quarter of  the refinery ran well with only limited restriction in the crude oil throughput rate early in the quarter when refining margins weakened 
in  the average crude oil throughput rate at our lima refinery was approximately  bpd 
our lima refinery had slightly reduced crude oil throughput rates in late september and early october due to delays in crude oil delivery caused by the hurricanes  in may and december due to mechanical problems with downstream units  and in several months throughout the year due to poor refining market conditions 
memphis refinery 
our memphis refinery was acquired effective march  and averaged approximately  bpd of crude oil throughput for the period from march  through december  the crude oil throughput rate was primarily restricted due to the maintenance turnaround of the fcc unit in the fourth quarter 
the crude oil throughput rate was restricted earlier in the year due to a high crude oil purchasing environment and planned downtime on a diesel hydrotreater unit 
the crude oil throughput rate was supplemented with more economic intermediate feedstocks at times in order to keep downstream units operating at full rates and to take advantage of the strong crack spreads 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in expenses for natural gas resulted in a million increase in operating expenses in as compared to high natural gas prices were a major contributor to this increase  resulting in an estimated million increase in as compared to the effects of the higher natural gas prices were partially offset by a reduction in natural gas usage due to planned downtime for maintenance turnarounds and more focused efforts on utilizing alternative energy options 
the increase in operating expenses also reflected million related to the addition of memphis refinery operations beginning in march  partially offset by million related to the absence of hartford refinery operations in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase is mainly attributable to a million accrual for incentive compensation and increases in costs for certain employee benefit programs  insurance  legal fees  sarbanes oxley act compliance and non recurring tax consulting and erp system improvement costs 
in addition  cost reduction measures initiated in as a result of the restructuring of our st 
louis general office were partially offset by additional administrative activities required in connection with the acquisition of our memphis refinery in march stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase related to the grant of additional options in and 
table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was principally due to capital expenditure activity and the addition of the memphis refinery in interest expense and finance income  net 
interest expense and finance income  net increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional interest expense related to a net increase in long term debt of million and lower interest income  partially offset by lower financing costs and higher capitalized interest in income tax provision benefit 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in the corresponding period in our effective tax rate was in as compared to in our subsidiaries are subject to different statutory tax rates 
these differing tax rates and the differing amount of taxable income or loss recognized by each subsidiary impact our consolidated effective tax rate 
the decrease in our consolidated effective tax rate in as compared to resulted from a higher percentage of our consolidated income being recognized by sabine  which has a lower effective tax rate than other subsidiaries 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax liability of million prg million 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
when applicable a valuation allowance should be recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as a result of the analysis of the likelihood of realizing the future tax benefit of a portion of our state tax loss carryforwards and a portion of our federal business tax credits  in we provided a valuation allowance of million related to our deferred tax assets 
the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets is analyzed on a regular basis and should it be determined that it is more likely than not that an additional portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  an increase to the tax valuation allowance and a corresponding income tax provision would be required at that time 
our pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes in the future will generally be fully subject to income taxes  although our actual cash payment of taxes is expected to benefit from regular tax and alternative minimum tax net operating loss carryforwards available at december  of approximately million and million prg million and million  respectively 
our regular tax net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire with the year ending december   to the extent they have not been used to reduce taxable income prior to such time 
approximately of the regular tax net operating carryforwards will have expired as of december   with a full expiring by december   to the extent they have not been used to reduce regular taxable income prior to such time 
our alternative minimum tax net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire with the year ending december   to the extent they have not been used to reduce alternative minimum taxable income prior to such time 
approximately of the alternative minimum tax net operating carryforwards will expire as of december   with an additional having expired as of december  and a full expiring by december   to the extent they have not been used to reduce alternative minimum taxable income prior to such time 
if we experience an ownership change of more than during any three year testing period as defined in section of the internal revenue code  the timing and extent of the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  other losses and tax credits could be affected 
we have had significant changes in the ownership of our common stock in the past three years 
accordingly  future changes  even slight changes  in the ownership of premcor  inc s common stock including  among other things  the exercise of compensatory options could result in an aggregate change in ownership of more than for purposes of section of the internal revenue code 
we expect a change in control as defined above in connection with the financing of the delaware city refinery thus causing the realization of net operating loss carryforwards  other losses and tax credits to extend further in the future 
however  we do not expect this change in control to impact our overall ability to realize our net operating loss carryforwards  other losses and tax credits in the future 
therefore  we do not anticipate the need for an additional valuation allowance as a result of this expected change in control 

table of contents compared to overview 
net loss available to common stockholders was million per diluted share in as compared to net income available to common stockholders of million per diluted share in our operating loss was million in as compared to operating income of million in the corresponding period in operating income loss included pretax refinery restructuring and other charges of million and million in and  respectively 
operating income decreased in compared to principally due to significantly weaker market conditions in than in net sales and operating revenues 
net sales and operating revenues decreased million  or  to  million in from  million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the closure of our hartford refinery in late september gross margin 
gross margin decreased million to million in from  million in the decrease in gross margin in as compared to was principally driven by significantly weaker market conditions in than in market these weak market conditions consisted of significantly weaker crack spreads and crude oil differentials 
beginning in late and continuing into the third quarter of  crack spreads were poor due to weak demand and high levels of distillate and gasoline inventories 
this margin environment was principally driven by a sluggish world economy  significant declines in air travel following the events of september   and an extremely mild winter 
the gulf coast and chicago crack spreads were approximately and lower  respectively  in than in the crude oil differentials were also significantly lower in as compared to the crude oil differential between wti and maya heavy sour crude oil was approximately lower in than in the crude oil differential between wti and wts sour crude oil was approximately lower in than in we believe these narrowed differentials were attributable to opec production cutbacks during  which were concentrated in heavy sour and light medium sour crude oils 
this had a significant negative impact on our gross margin because heavy sour and light medium sour crude oils accounted for between and of our crude oil throughput 
the overall decrease in the sour and heavy sour crude oil differentials reduced our gross margin by approximately million in as compared to refinery operations in  our port arthur refinery experienced reduced crude oil throughput for approximately days in november due to repairs on the reformer unit resulting from october s hurricane shutdown 
the refinery also experienced reduced crude oil throughput rates in late september and early october due to planned delays in crude oil supply resulting from anticipated repairs at the coker unit  which proved to be minimal  and during the remainder of october due to unplanned delays in crude oil supply resulting from the impact of production and transportation interruptions caused by hurricanes isidore and lili 
the port arthur refinery operations were also affected by the february shutdown of our coker unit for ten days for unplanned maintenance 
we took advantage of the coker outage to make repairs to the distillate and naphtha hydrotreaters  including turnaround maintenance that was originally planned for later in the year 
in january  we shut down the fluid catalytic cracking fcc unit  gas oil hydrotreating unit and sulfur plant for approximately days at our port arthur refinery for planned turnaround maintenance 
this turnaround maintenance did not affect crude oil throughput rates but did lower gasoline production 
we sold more unfinished products during the first quarter of due to this shutdown 
in  the average crude oil throughput rate at our lima refinery was basically the same as its rate and reflected its economic capacity 
crude oil throughput at higher rates produces additional high sulfur diesel for which there is only a limited market 
our lima refinery had slightly reduced crude oil throughput rates in late 
table of contents september and early october due to delays in crude oil delivery caused by the hurricanes  in may and december due to mechanical problems with downstream units  and in several months throughout the year due to poor refining market conditions 
the lima refinery s results for were also affected by a new crude oil supply agreement  which provided approximately per barrel of cost savings in the fourth quarter of in  crude oil throughput rates at our port arthur refinery were below capacity because units downstream were in start up operations during the first quarter and a lightning strike in early may limited the crude unit rate until the crude unit was shut down in early july for ten days to repair the damage caused by the lightning strike 
the port arthur refinery also experienced a slightly reduced crude oil throughput rate late in the fourth quarter due to minor repairs of the coker and crude units 
in march  the lima refinery performed a planned month long maintenance turnaround on its coker and isocracker units  and in november it performed a planned seven day maintenance turnaround on its crude and other units 
the lima refinery also experienced crude oil supply delays caused by bad weather in the gulf coast early in our hartford refinery experienced ten days of unplanned downtime for coker unit repairs early in the year and planned restricted utilization of the coker unit late in the year due to a minor repairs and a shutdown of a third party sulfur plant utilized by hartford 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease in was principally due to significantly lower natural gas prices  lower repair and maintenance costs particularly at port arthur  and the closure of the hartford refinery in the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by higher insurance and employee expenses 
the higher insurance expenses related to the overall insurance environment after the events of september   and the higher employee expenses related primarily to new benefit plans and higher medical benefit costs for both current and post retirement plans 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was principally due to lower wages and benefits  partially offset by relocation costs associated with our new connecticut office 
the lower wages related to the elimination of administrative positions  primarily at our st 
louis based office  as part of the restructuring 
the lower benefits principally related to lower incentive compensation under our annual incentive program partially offset by higher costs associated with new pension and retirement plans and both current and post retirement employee medical benefit plans 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense totaled million for  due to the grant of  options during the year 
in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
prior to  we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
no stock based compensation cost was reported in  as all options granted in and earlier had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was principally due to ceasing the recording of depreciation and amortization expense for the hartford refinery assets beginning in march this decrease was partially offset by higher amortization expenses in at our lima refinery due to the completion of turnarounds performed in  and higher amortization in at our port arthur refinery due to the completion of turnaround activity in early interest expense and finance income  net 
interest expense and finance income  net decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease related primarily to lower interest expense due to the repurchase of certain debt securities in the third quarter of and in the second quarter of and lower interest rates on our floating rate debt 
this decrease was partially offset by lower interest income as cash balances declined 

table of contents income tax provision benefit 
we recorded a million income tax benefit in compared to an income tax provision of million in the corresponding period in the income tax benefit for included an increase of million to the deferred tax valuation allowance  which was recorded to reflect the likelihood of not realizing the future benefit of a portion of our federal business credits and a portion of our state tax loss carryforwards 
the income tax provision for included the reversal of a million deferred tax valuation allowance as a result of the analysis of the likelihood of realizing the future tax benefit of our federal and state tax loss carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credits and federal and state business tax credits 
outlook this outlook section contains forward looking statements that reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business 
even though we believe our expectations regarding future events are reasonable assumptions  forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance 
factors beyond our control could cause our actual results to vary materially from our expectations and are discussed on the first page of this annual report on form k  under the heading forward looking statements 
market 
market conditions for the first two months of the first quarter of have been strong 
the gulf coast crack spread has averaged approximately per barrel  the chicago crack spread has averaged approximately per barrel  and the wti maya differential has averaged approximately per barrel 
we believe the market outlook for as a whole will be favorable for the us refining industry due to an increasingly tight supply and demand balance for oil products 
we expect that the continuing recovery of the economy will support strong demand for refined products and that more stringent requirements on fuel sulfur content mandated by the federal environmental protection agency will result in a tighter supply of refined products 
the phase in of the low sulfur fuel requirements began on january  and will continue through it is common practice in our industry to look to benchmark market indicators as a proxy predictor for refining margins  such as the gulf coast and chicago to improve the reliability of this benchmark as a predictor of actual refining margins  it must first be adjusted for a crude oil slate that is not light and sweet 
secondly  it must be adjusted to reflect variances from the benchmark product slate to the actual  or anticipated  product slate 
lastly  it must be adjusted for any other factors not anticipated in the benchmark  including crude oil and product grade differentials  ancillary crude and product costs such as transportation  storage and credit fees  inventory fluctuations and price risk management activities 
refinery operations 
our port arthur refinery has historically produced roughly equal parts gasoline and distillate 
for this reason  we believe the gulf coast crack spread appropriately reflects our product slate 
however  approximately of port arthur s product slate is lower value petroleum coke  sulfur  and residual oils which will negatively impact the refinery s performance against the benchmark crack spread 
port arthur s crude oil slate is approximately heavy sour crude oil and medium sour crude oil 
accordingly  the wti maya and wti wts crude oil differentials can be used as an adjustment to the benchmark crack spread 
we do not expect to receive discounts on our purchases of maya crude oil in under our long term crude oil supply agreement 
ancillary crude costs  primarily transportation  at port arthur averaged per barrel of crude oil throughput in the year ended december  in  we expect our full year crude oil throughput rate to approximate  bpd 
this throughput rate reflects a maintenance turnaround of the reformer unit in the first quarter and maintenance turnaround of the crude  coker  hydrocracker  and hydrotreater units in the later part of the year 
based on current market conditions  the scheduled maintenance turnaround of the reformer unit  which began in late december and was completed on february   and subsequent mechanical issues after the reformer unit start up  we expect the crude oil throughput rate at our port arthur refinery to approximate  bpd to  bpd in the first quarter of our lima refinery has a product slate of approximately gasoline and distillate and we believe the chicago is an appropriate benchmark crack spread 
this refinery consumes approximately light sweet 
table of contents crude oil with the balance being light sour crude oils 
we opportunistically buy a mix of domestic and foreign sweet crude oils 
the foreign crude oils consumed at lima are priced relative to brent and the wti brent differential can be used to adjust the benchmark 
ancillary crude costs for lima averaged per barrel of crude throughput in the year ended december  in  we expect our full year crude oil throughput rate to approximate  bpd 
this throughput rate reflects a month long full refinery maintenance turnaround that will begin in early march 
based on current market conditions and the full refinery turnaround in march  we expect the crude oil throughput rate at our lima refinery to approximate  bpd to  bpd in the first quarter of our memphis refinery was acquired effective march  and averaged approximately  bpd of crude oil throughput for the period from march  through december  we expect that the operating results will track a gulf coast benchmark crack spread and that we will be able to realize a gross margin benefit over the gulf coast crack spread of approximately per barrel  resulting from location premiums for refined products  partially offset by crude oil transportation costs 
in  we expect our full year crude oil throughput rate to approximate  bpd 
based on current market conditions  we expect the crude oil throughput rate at our memphis refinery to approximate  bpd to  bpd in the first quarter of the crude oil throughput rate will be supplemented with more economic intermediate feedstocks in order to keep downstream units operating at full rates and to take advantage of strong crack spreads 
operating expenses 
natural gas is the most variable component of our operating expenses 
on an annual basis  our port arthur  memphis and lima refineries purchase approximately million mmbtu of natural gas  with most of these purchases relating to our port arthur refinery 
in a per mmbtu natural gas price environment and assuming average crude oil throughput levels  our annual operating expenses should range between million and million 
it is also important to note that  under contracts that expire in september  we contract for the purchase of natural gas on a calendar month basis and set the price at the beginning of the month 
therefore  our natural gas costs reflect the price of natural gas on the day the contract is set  and not the average price for the period 
we are reviewing options to mitigate our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations 
general and administrative expenses 
we expect first quarter general and administrative expense  excluding incentive compensation expense  will range from million to million 
our incentive compensation expense for will be based solely on our achievement of earnings per share results in excess of a minimum of per share 
in administering the plan  our board of directors typically exclude refinery restructuring charges and other special items  stock based compensation expense  and bonus accruals in determining the threshold earnings per share level 
stock based compensation expense 
we recognize non cash  stock based compensation expense computed under statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
accounting for stock based compensation for all stock options granted beginning in stock based compensation expense in  for options granted in through  will approximate million to million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of was million 
this quarterly rate will increase in future periods based upon the completion and placing into service of our capital expenditure activity 
capital activity is generally depreciated over a year life 
depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of our turnaround costs  generally over four years 
interest expense 
based on our outstanding long term debt as of december   our annual gross interest expense will be approximately million and amortization of deferred financing costs will be approximately million 
all of our outstanding debt is at fixed rates with the exception of million in floating rate notes tied to libor 
reported interest expense is reduced by capitalized interest  which we estimate will be approximately million to million in 
table of contents income taxes 
we expect our effective income tax rate for will range from approximately to 
capital expenditures and turnarounds 
capital expenditures and turnarounds for the year ended december  totaled million 
this amount excludes the purchase price of the memphis refinery 
we plan to expend approximately million to million for turnarounds and capital expenditures  excluding capitalized interest  in approximately million of these expenditures relate to turnaround activity 
we plan to fund capital expenditures with internally generated funds and cash on hand 
if internally generated funds and cash on hand are insufficient  we will reduce our capital expenditure plans accordingly 
we are continuing to evaluate a project to reconfigure the lima refinery to process a more sour and heavier crude slate 
we are also evaluating a similar project at our memphis refinery 
these initiatives are in a very preliminary stage 
delaware city refinery acquisition 
in january  we announced our plans to acquire motiva enterprises llc s  bpd delaware city refining complex located in delaware city  delaware 
see recent developments in above 
we expect to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of at a purchase price of million  plus the value of the petroleum inventories 
we expect the inventories will be approximately million 
we expect to finance the purchase price with equal parts equity and debt 
we intend to enter into long term crude oil supply agreements as well as off take agreements in relation to the operations of this refinery 
these agreements will have market based pricing mechanisms 
the refinery is capable of processing more than  barrels per day  thus adding approximately percent to our capacity base 
we will utilize the new york harbor reformulated gasoline  or nyh rfg  crack spread as a benchmark for the delaware city refinery operations 
our actual results will vary as our crude oil and product slates differ from the nyh rfg slate and for other ancillary costs 
operating expenses will be impacted by the level of production of the petroleum coke gasification unit 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances as of december   we had a cash and short term investment balance of million of which million was held by prg  million was held by premcor inc  and million was held by other premcor inc 
subsidiaries 
as of december   we had a cash and short term investment balance of million of which million was held by prg  million was held by premcor inc  and million was by other premcor inc subsidiaries 
under an amended and restated common security agreement related to pacc s long term debt  pacc is required to maintain million of cash for debt service at all times and restrict an amount equal to the next scheduled principal and interest payment  prorated based on the number of months remaining until that payment is due 
cash was restricted under these requirements totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
except for the pacc cash restrictions mentioned above  there are no restrictions limiting dividends from pacc to prg and  under an amended working capital facility  pacc is required to dividend to prg all excess cash over million  excluding the restricted debt service amounts 
also  pursuant to the amended working capital facility  if an aggregate intercompany payable from prg to pacc exceeds million at any time  pacc shall forgive prg such excess amount  which would take the form of a non cash dividend 
non cash dividends of million were made in no such dividends were made in premcor inc maintains a directors and officers insurance policy  which insures our directors and officers from any claim arising out of an alleged wrongful act by such persons in their respective capacities as directors and officers 
pursuant to indemnity agreements between premcor inc and each of our directors and officers  
table of contents premcor inc formed a captive insurance subsidiary  opus energy risk limited  in to provide additional liability coverage for such claims 
premcor inc funded million as of december   and has committed to funding million annually until a loss fund of million is established 
cash flows from operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash flows from operating activities were mainly impacted by strong cash earnings for the years ended december  and the significantly lower cash provided from operating activities in is mainly attributable to weak market conditions  which resulted in poor operating results 
working capital as of december  was million  a to current ratio  versus million as of december   a to current ratio 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to strong operating results  the memphis refinery acquisition  and cash proceeds from our june debt offering 
working capital experienced some significant fluctuations as of december  as compared to december  our accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  and inventory balances increased primarily due to the acquisition of and subsequent activity at our memphis refinery 
inventories also increased due to the purchase of a million barrel crude oil linefill for our lima refinery from morgan stanley capital group inc  or mscg 
under an agreement with mscg we were obligated to purchase the barrels in october  however  we terminated the agreement in june and purchased the crude oil at a net cost of approximately million 
our accounts receivable and accounts payable balances increased due to greater buying and selling activity related to the supply of domestic crude oil for our lima and memphis refineries 
our accrued expenses and accrued taxes other than income tax balances increased due to memphis refinery activity 
accrued expenses were further affected by higher accrued interest due to changes in interest payment dates under our new long term debt commitments  an accrual for the memphis acquisition earn out payment due in  accrued bonuses for under our incentive compensation plans  and accruals related to the lease obligations under the rejected cre leases 
we currently expect that funds generated from operating activities together with existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and availability under our working capital facility will be adequate to fund our ongoing operating requirements 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the cash flows used in investing activities in reflected the acquisition of the memphis refinery  including a subsequent contingency payment  of million and proceeds from the sale of certain processing units and ancillary assets at our hartford refinery of million 
aside from these items  activity in   and primarily reflected capital expenditures including turnarounds 
we classify our capital expenditures into two main categories  mandatory and discretionary 
mandatory capital expenditures  such as for turnarounds and maintenance  are required to maintain safe and reliable operations or to comply with regulations pertaining to soil  water and air contamination or pollution  regulations pertaining to new product standards  and regulations pertaining to occupational safety and health issues 
our total mandatory capital and refinery maintenance turnaround expenditures  excluding expenditures for new product standards discussed below  were million  million  and million for the year ended december    and  respectively 
we estimate that total mandatory capital and turnaround expenditures  excluding expenditures for new product standards  for all three refineries will average million per year over the next four years and the budget for these expenditures is approximately million for we plan to 
table of contents fund mandatory capital expenditures with available cash and cash flow from operations and will adjust our annual expenditures accordingly 
the environmental protection agency  or epa  has promulgated regulations under the clean air act that establish stringent sulfur content specifications for gasoline and on road diesel fuel designed to reduce air emissions from the use of these products 
in addition to the mandatory expenditures discussed above  we expect to incur total expenditures of approximately million  including million that we expect to expend through  in order to comply with environmental regulations related to the new stringent sulfur content specifications 
the total costs have been revised from an aggregate of million reported in the annual report on form k for gasoline and diesel fuel specification requirements and include further refinement of the plans and in particular a more detailed plan for the newly acquired memphis refinery 
tier motor vehicle emission standards 
in february  the epa promulgated the tier motor vehicle emission standards final rule for all passenger vehicles  establishing standards for sulfur content in gasoline 
these regulations mandate that the average sulfur content of gasoline for highway use produced at any refinery not exceed ppm during any calendar year by january   phasing in beginning on january  we currently produce gasoline under the new sulfur standards at our port arthur refinery  and we expect to comply with the gasoline standards at our memphis refinery in the second quarter of as a result of the corporate pool averaging provisions of the regulations and our possession of what we believe  based on current information  to be sufficient sulfur credits  we intend to defer a significant portion of the investment required for compliance at our lima refinery until the end of we believe  based on current estimates  that compliance with the new tier gasoline specifications will require us to make capital expenditures in the aggregate through of approximately million  of which million had been incurred as of december  future revisions to this cost estimate  and the estimated time during which costs are incurred  may be necessary 
as of december   we have outstanding contract commitments of million related to the design and construction activity at our refineries for the tier gasoline compliance 
low sulfur diesel standards 
in january  the epa promulgated its on road diesel regulations  which will require a reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel sold for highway use by june   with full compliance by january  we estimate that capital expenditures required to comply with the on road diesel standards at all three refineries in the aggregate through is approximately million 
future revisions to the cost estimate  and the estimated time during which costs are incurred  may be necessary 
the projected investment is expected to be incurred during through with the greatest concentration of spending occurring in since the lima refinery does not currently produce diesel fuel to on road specifications  we are considering an acceleration of the low sulfur diesel investment at the lima refinery in order to capture this incremental product value 
if the investment is accelerated  production of the low sulfur fuel is possible by the fourth quarter of in  we expect to make expenditures of approximately million for compliance with tier gasoline standards and on road diesel regulations  excluding capitalized interest 
we spent million and million in and  respectively  related to these regulations 
it is our intention to fund expenditures necessary to comply with these new environmental standards with cash flow from operations 
due to the volatile economic nature of our business we are organizing our plans and associated expenditures for compliance with these regulations into modules that can be shifted based on available funding 
this will allow us to expedite or slow down the major portions of the project without compromising compliance dates but allowing us to take advantage of phase in periods if necessary 
discretionary capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity  improvement in product yields and or a reduction in operating costs 
accordingly  total discretionary capital expenditures may be less than budget if cash flow is lower than expected and higher than budget if cash flow is better than expected 
discretionary capital expenditures are undertaken by us on a voluntary basis after thorough analytical review and screening of projects based on the expected return on incremental capital employed 

table of contents in  we announced plans to expand our port arthur  texas refinery 
the plans include increasing port arthur s crude oil throughput capacity from its current rate of  bpd to approximately  bpd  and expanding the coker unit capacity from its current rated capacity of  bpd to  bpd  which will further increase our ability to process lower cost  heavy sour crude oil 
this project is estimated to cost between million and million and is expected to be completed by the beginning of this project will be funded primarily from the proceeds of the million in senior notes issued in june  which are described below in cash flows from financing activities 
our discretionary capital expenditures were million  million  and million for the year ended december    and  respectively 
our budget for discretionary capital expenditures is approximately million for  which includes approximately million related to the port arthur expansion project 
we plan to fund mandatory and discretionary capital expenditures with available cash and cash flow from operations and will adjust our annual expenditures accordingly 
the following table summarizes the capital expenditures described above for the following years in millions projected mandatory  excluding low sulfur standards gasoline low sulfur standards diesel low sulfur standards discretionary total cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in  premcor inc received net proceeds of approximately million from a public offering of million shares of common stock and a private offering of million shares of common stock with blackstone capital partners iii merchant banking fund lp and its affiliates  a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corporation  and certain premcor executives 
in february  prg completed an offering of million in senior notes  of which million  due in  bear interest at per annum and million  due in  bear interest at per annum 
a portion of the net proceeds of these transactions was utilized to redeem the remaining million principal balance of premcor usa s subordinated debentures at a million premium  to repay prg s million floating rate loan at par  and to purchase  in the open market  million in face value of a portion of the senior notes at a million premium 
in june  prg completed an offering of million in senior notes  due  bearing interest at per annum 
in november  prg issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior and senior subordinated notes  which consisted of million of senior notes due  bearing interest at per annum and million of senior subordinated notes due  bearing interest at per annum 
prg used the proceeds from these notes to redeem its senior notes  senior notes  and senior subordinated notes which totaled million in the aggregate at a million premium 
pacc made million of scheduled principal payments on its senior notes in in  we incurred deferred financing costs of million related to the issuance of our new bonds and the amendment of our credit agreement 
in  premcor inc received total net proceeds of million from the sale of its common stock  which consisted of net proceeds of million from an initial public offering of million shares of its common stock  million from the concurrent sales of  shares of common stock in the aggregate to

o malley and two of its directors  and million from the exercise of stock options under its stock incentive plans 
in  premcor usa and prg redeemed and repurchased in aggregate  million in principal amount of long term debt from premcor inc s initial public offering proceeds and approximately million from available cash 
prg redeemed the remaining million of its senior notes at par value 
premcor usa redeemed the remaining million of its senior notes  including a million premium  and repurchased  in the open market  million in aggregate principal amount of its subordinated debentures at a million premium 
pacc repaid its senior secured bank loan balance of million at a million premium 
pacc also made a scheduled million principal payment of its senior notes 
in  we incurred deferred financing costs of million primarily related to the consent process that permitted the sabine restructuring 
in  we repurchased in the open market million in face value of our senior notes  million in face value of our senior notes  and million in face value of our exchangeable preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in  we incurred deferred financing costs of million principally associated with the amendment of our credit agreement 
cash and cash equivalents restricted for debt repayment reflected changes to the portion of restricted cash that related to future principal payments 
the change in restricted cash related to future interest payments is included in cash flows from operating activities 
in  premcor inc made capital contributions to premcor usa of million million and premcor usa subsequently contributed million million to prg  all primarily for the acquisition of the memphis refinery in and for the repayment of long term debt 
in  prg returned capital of million to premcor usa 
we continue to evaluate the most efficient use of capital and  from time to time  depending upon market conditions  may seek to purchase certain of our outstanding debt securities in the open market or by other means  in each case to the extent permitted by existing covenant restrictions 
we have substantial indebtedness that has affected our financial flexibility historically and may significantly affect our financial flexibility in the future 
as of december   we had total long term debt  including current maturities  of  million prg  million and cash  short term investments and cash restricted for debt service of million prg million 
we had stockholders equity of  million  resulting in a total debt to total capitalization ratio of 
prg had stockholder s equity of  million  resulting in a total debt to total capitalization ratio of 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future  although our ability to do so will be restricted by the terms of our existing indebtedness 
the level of our indebtedness has several important consequences for our future operations  including that a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  covenants contained in our existing debt arrangements require us to meet or maintain certain financial tests  which may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our industry  such as being able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate and other purposes may be limited  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors that are less leveraged  and we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions 
our long term debt instruments subject us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants 
covenants contained in various indentures and credit agreements place restrictions on  among other things  our subsidiaries 
table of contents ability to incur additional indebtedness  place liens upon our subsidiaries assets  pay dividends or make certain restricted payments and investments  consummate certain asset sales or asset swaps  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  make certain payments to premcor inc or to other subsidiaries or affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  conduct businesses other than our current businesses  merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit agreement also requires our subsidiaries to satisfy or maintain certain financial condition tests  as more fully described below in credit agreements 
our subsidiaries ability to meet these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control and they may not meet such tests 
in addition  prg s credit agreement currently limits the amount of future additional indebtedness that may be incurred by prg and its subsidiaries to million 
accordingly  it may be necessary for us to obtain a waiver or amendment of our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness in excess of the prg credit agreement limitation 
there is no assurance that such waiver or amendment can be obtained  or obtained on a timely basis 
credit agreements prg s credit agreement  which was amended and restated in february  provides for letter of credit issuances of up to the lesser of million or an amount available under a defined borrowing base  less outstanding borrowings 
the facility may be increased to million under certain circumstances 
prg utilizes this facility primarily for the issuance of letters of credit to secure crude oil purchase obligations 
the borrowing base includes prg s cash and eligible cash equivalents  eligible investments  eligible receivables  eligible petroleum inventories  paid but unexpired letters of credit  net obligations on swap contracts and pacc s eligible hydrocarbon inventory 
the credit agreement expires in february as of december   the borrowing base was  million december  million  with million december  million of the facility utilized for letters of credit 
the credit agreement provides for direct cash borrowings of up to  but not exceeding in the aggregate  million  subject to sublimits of million for working capital and general corporate purposes and a sublimit of million for acquisition related working capital 
acquisition related borrowings are subject to a defined repayment provision 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of prg s cash and cash equivalents  receivables  crude oil and refined product inventories and trademarks and pacc s hydrocarbon inventory 
prg s interest rate for any borrowings under this agreement would bear interest at a rate based on either the us prime lending rate or the eurodollar rate plus a defined margin  at our option based on certain restrictions 
as of december  and  there were no direct cash borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains covenants and conditions that  among other things  limit prg s dividends  indebtedness  liens  investments and contingent obligations 
prg is also required to comply with certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of working capital of at least million and the maintenance of tangible net worth of at least million 
the covenants also provide for a cumulative cash flow test that from january  to february  must not be less than zero 
prg also has a million cash collateralized credit facility expiring in may this facility was arranged in support of lower interest rates on the series ohio bonds 
in addition  this facility can be utilized for other non hydrocarbon purposes 
as of december   million december  million of the line of credit was utilized for letters of credit 
with the expiration of this facility in may  we have the option to extend the expiration date of the current facility  replace the facility  or transfer the existing letters of credit to the million credit facility 
we also have the ability to fix the interest rate on the ohio bonds in which case additional security would no longer be required 

table of contents liquidity requirements related to obligations contractual obligations in the table below  we summarize the payment schedule for our contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations capital expenditure commitments certain purchase obligations under long term contracts cannot be estimated due to the variable terms related to volumes and prices 
see the description of our purchase obligations and other long term liabilities below 
operating leases 
we lease refinery equipment  crude oil tankers  catalyst  tank cars  office space  and office equipment from unrelated third parties with lease terms ranging from to years with the option to purchase some of the equipment at the end of the lease term at fair market value 
we lease some land in relation to our memphis refinery operations with terms that extend years and years 
the leases generally provide that we pay taxes  insurance  and maintenance expenses related to the leased assets 
we are also subject to remaining payments on leases that were rejected from the cre bankruptcy as described above in factors affecting comparability discontinued operations 
the terms of these leases range from to years 
certain of these properties are being subleased 
capital expenditure commitments 
as of december   we have entered into contracts totaling million related to the design and construction activity at our refineries for tier gasoline compliance 
we will make these expenditures in purchase obligations 
we enter into contracts for the purchase of goods and services on a regular basis in relation to the purchase of crude oil  natural gas  and other production and utility related items 
with the exception of the long term crude oil contract discussed below  our crude oil purchase contracts have terms ranging from one to three months and are based on market prices or a formula reflecting a differential to a market index 
we also enter into contracts related to the supply of other feedstocks and blendstocks used in our refining processes and the terms of these contracts are usually under one year or can be cancelled within one year 
we are party to a long term crude oil supply agreement with an affiliate of pemex  which currently supplies approximately  barrels per day of maya crude oil 
under the terms of this agreement  pacc is obligated to buy maya crude oil from the affiliate of pemex  and the affiliate of pemex is obligated to sell maya crude oil to pacc 
the pricing of the crude oil is based on then current market prices 
the volume of crude oil is adjusted semiannually based on a formula specified in the contract 
future obligations can be further affected by a price adjustment mechanism designed to provide us with a minimum average coker margin over the first eight years of the contract as described in factors affecting our operating results 
the price adjustment mechanism expires in and the agreement expires in we also have certain contracts related to the fuel supply for our refineries 
our natural gas contracts provide firm delivery amounts but also provide flexibility in volumes at certain pricing formula levels 
these contracts are based on market prices or a formula reflecting a differential to a market index 
these contracts are also short term in nature or can be canceled with notice 
we purchase hydrogen at our port arthur refinery under a year 
table of contents contract that provides minimum volumes and the flexibility to purchase additional volumes if necessary 
under this contract we are required to purchase minimum volumes on a quarterly basis or make payments equal to what would be due for these minimum volumes 
we made payments totaling million in in relation to this hydrogen supply contract and we would need to make minimum payments of approximately million on an annual basis under the minimum requirements of the contract 
minimum requirements would be waived in the case of certain events occurring beyond our control 
we also contract for certain services under long term contracts  some of which have minimum contract volumes or dollar amounts 
we have a contract with millennium pipeline company  lp for the transportation of crude oil over its millennium pipeline system as a source for transporting foreign crude oil to our lima refinery 
the contract expires in may and will automatically renew for one year periods unless notice is given six months prior to a renewal date 
we are obligated to transport certain minimum amounts of crude oil on the millennium pipeline or pay an amount equal to the transportation rate for each barrel of crude oil below the commitment amount 
the minimum amounts are determined on an annual basis 
under this contract we made payments totaling million in  and we would need to make minimum payments of approximately million on an annual basis if we did not meet any of our committed volumes 
we also have a contract allowing us to store and throughput petroleum products at certain third party terminal locations  which expires in april we are obligated to meet certain minimum dollar amounts related to throughput activity on an annual basis under this agreement or make payments for the amounts below the commitment level 
under this contract we made payments totaling million in  and our minimum payments would equate to approximately million on an annual basis if we did not meet our committed amounts 
we also have a ten year contract expiring in for the operation and maintenance of a petroleum coke handling system at our port arthur refinery 
we are obligated to meet certain minimum dollar amounts related to petroleum coke handling fees on an annual basis 
under this contract our minimum payments would equate to approximately million on an annual basis 
other long term liabilities 
we have several pension benefit and postretirement benefit plans as further described in critical accounting judgments and estimates pension benefit and postretirement employee benefit plans  for which we have obligations extending into the future 
in  we expect to contribute million to our pension plans and to make payments of million related to our obligations under our other post retirement benefit plans 
other obligations environmental and legal liabilities 
as a result of our normal course of business  the closure of two of our refineries  and continuing obligations related to our previously owned retail operations  we are party to certain legal proceedings and environmental related obligations 
in relation to these matters and obligations  we have accrued  on primarily an undiscounted basis  million as of december  december  million 
we expect to spend approximately million to million in related to the environmental remediation activities 
upon closure of our blue island and hartford refineries we recorded a liability for environmental remediation obligations associated with their closure 
the environmental obligations take into account costs that are reasonably foreseeable at this time 
in relation to the blue island liability  we are currently in discussions with governmental agencies concerning a remediation program and expect to have a final plan in place in in relation to the hartford liability  we are in preliminary stages of producing a remediation plan 
as the remediation plans are finalized and as work is performed  adjustments of the liabilities may be necessary 
we have other environmental remediation activity related to previously owned assets and currently operating assets for which we have also recorded a liability and which may require adjustments in the future as more information becomes available 
related party transactions the following related party transactions are not discussed elsewhere in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents prg and affiliates as of december   prg had a payable to premcor inc for management fees paid by premcor inc on prg s behalf of million million 
as of december   prg also had a loan receivable from premcor inc for million million  which included both principal and interest 
prg s subsidiary  premcor investments inc  loaned these proceeds to premcor inc to allow premcor inc 
to pay certain fees 
the loan bears interest at per annum 
as of december   prg had an amount due to affiliates of million million related to income taxes and its tax sharing agreement with premcor inc and its predecessor 
as of december   prg had a receivable from the premcor pipeline co 
of million related to amounts that prg paid on behalf of the premcor pipeline co 
as of december   prg had a payable to the premcor pipeline co 
of million million for pipeline tariffs and fees due to the premcor pipeline co for use of pipelines and storage for the memphis operations 
these intercompany balances are eliminated in premcor inc s consolidated financial statements 
fuel strategies international  inc we entered into an agreement with fuel strategies international fsi effective june pursuant to this agreement  fsi provides monthly  consulting services related to our petroleum coke and commercial operations 
the agreement automatically renews for additional one year periods unless terminated by either party upon days notice prior to expiration 
the principal of fsi is the brother of our chairman and chief executive officer 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred fees of million and million  respectively  related to this agreement 
blackstone we had an agreement with an affiliate of one of premcor inc s major shareholders  blackstone capital partners iii merchant banking fund lp and its affiliates blackstone  under which we incurred a monitoring fee equal to million per annum subject to increases relating to inflation 
the monitoring agreement was terminated effective march  we recorded expenses related to the annual monitoring fee and the reimbursement of out of pocket costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these judgments and estimates often involve future events 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
in addition  management has discussed these accounting policies and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time of the valuations 
actual results may differ significantly from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting judgments and estimates are based on our accounting practices during contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with the fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an 
table of contents estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal and other liabilities requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be over or understated 
environmental matters 
accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a site by site basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated as specifically defined in sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
to determine our ultimate liability at these sites  we have used third party engineers and attorneys to assist in the evaluation of several factors  including the extent of contamination  currently enacted laws and regulations  existing technology  the most appropriate remedy  and identification of other potentially responsible parties  among other factors 
actual settlement of our liability for environmental matters could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  such as the extent of contamination at a particular site  the final remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 
actual amounts could also differ from our estimates as a result of changes in future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution including both legal and remediation costs 
major maintenance turnarounds 
a turnaround is a periodically required standard procedure for maintenance of a refinery that involves the shutdown and inspection of major processing units which occurs approximately every three to five years 
turnaround costs include actual direct and contract labor  and material costs incurred for the overhaul  inspection  and replacement of major components of refinery processing and support units performed during turnaround 
turnaround costs  which are included in other assets on our balance sheet  are currently amortized on a straight line basis over the period until the next scheduled turnaround  beginning the month following completion 
the amortization of the turnaround costs is presented as amortization in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants acsec approved a statement of position sop entitled accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment 
final approval by the financial accounting standards board of the sop is pending 
this sop requires companies  among other things  to expense as incurred certain turnaround costs 
adoption of the sop would require that any existing unamortized turnaround costs be expensed immediately  as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  net of income taxes  in the consolidated statement of operations 
if this proposed change were in effect at december   we would have been required to write off unamortized pretax turnaround costs of approximately million 
as the sop is currently proposed  the provisions of the sop would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing the impact of other provisions of this sop  in particular the provisions that relate to the capitalization of certain project costs and the adoption of component accounting for property  plant and equipment 
inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined under the lifo method for hydrocarbon inventories including crude oil  refined products  and blendstocks 
the cost of warehouse stock and other inventories is determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
any reserve for inventory cost in excess of market value is reversed if physical inventories turn and prices recover above cost 
as of december  the replacement cost market value of our crude oil and refined product inventories exceeded its carrying value by approximately million  or approximately per barrel over cost 
if the market value of these inventories had been lower by over per barrel as of december   we would have had to write down the value of our inventory 
if prices significantly decline from year end levels  we may be required to write down the value of our inventories in future periods 
long lived assets 
we account for property  plant and equipment at cost and depreciate these assets over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
if we have changes in events or circumstances  
table of contents including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or a determination to abandon or divest certain assets  such assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
if such circumstances arise  we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset  if the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
we use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
in  we closed our blue island refinery and in we ceased refining operations at our hartford refinery 
these assets were reduced to their fair value when we announced our exit plans 
we also recorded liabilities associated with estimated refinery closure and decomissioning costs  and employee severance expenses 
we also established environmental liabilities in accordance with aicpa statement of position environmental remediation liabilities 
as of december   the carrying value of the blue island and hartford refinery assets  excluding assets that continue to be utilized for our supply and distribution operations at both sites  has been reduced to zero 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in making this determination 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize the future benefit of a portion of our federal business credits and a portion of our state tax loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred income tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event actual results differ from our estimates  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance in the future 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for all employee awards granted and modified after january  sfas no 
states that the adoption of the fair value based method is a change to a preferable method of accounting 
we determine the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model requires that we make certain assumptions as to the expected lives of our options  the expected volatility of our stock price  expected dividend rates and the risk free rate of return at the date of each grant 
judgment is required in selecting these assumptions and management believes its method for selecting these assumptions is reasonable and consistently applied 
pension benefit and postretirement employee benefit plans 
we have four defined benefit pension plans and two postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans that require us to use judgment in selecting the actuarial assumptions used to estimate our expense and liability for these plans 
based on the actuarially determined amounts we record a liability for the cost of the plans less any plan assets 
the plan assets are comprised of total contributions to the plan and investment income earned 
the expense associated with these plans is recorded to operating expenses and general and administrative expenses depending on the plan 
as of december   we have a liability of million for our postretirement plan obligations and a net liability of million for our pension plan obligations  which reflects plan assets of million 
the weighted average assumptions used in the actuarially determined liability for our pension plans december measurement date and postretirement health care plans september measurement date are as follows pension plans postretirement plans discount rate expected return on asset average rate of compensation increase in addition to these assumptions for the health care plans  we utilize a health care cost trend rate that currently reflects a increase in  declining by per year to an ultimate rate of in 
table of contents our discount rate is based on the yield of a published long term corporate bond index that has a duration equivalent to our obligations under the plans 
the discount rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates and a decrease in the discount rate will increase the estimated liability of the plans and increase future expenses related to the plans 
our expected rate of return on plan assets of is based on an inflation assumption of and real rate of return of 
this real rate of return was derived using an asset allocation model developed by our investment consultant and takes into consideration historical  long term equity and fixed income securities experience 
in order to achieve this return  our pension plan investment policy statement established a long term asset allocation structure of in equity securities and in fixed income securities 
the actual return on our plan assets is subject to our investment mix and general market conditions 
the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned 
the health care cost trend rate is based on an assessment of overall health care cost increases and our company s experience 
we review all of these assumptions on an annual basis 
presented below is a table that demonstrates how a decrease in the discount rate assumption and a increase in the health care cost trend rate assumption would effect our benefit liabilities as of december  and our expenses in millions pension benefits other postretirement benefits increase to benefit liability discount rate health care cost trend rate increase in expense discount rate health care cost trend rate because our pension asset funds are newly funded  a decrease in our expected return on plan assets would not have a material impact on our expenses at this time 
two of our pension plans are qualified and funded based on requirements under the employment retirement income security act of  as amended  or erisa 
we made contributions of million to these plans in our senior executive retirement plan will be funded beginning in we expect to contribute approximately million in for all pension related plans 
as established by our benefit committee  we have a pension plan investment policy statement  which designates a long term asset allocation structure of in equity securities and in fixed income securities to reach our investment goals 
we established our investment policy at the same time that we were restructuring our refining assets and corporate infrastrucuture 
as a result  the need to maintain asset liquidity delayed full implementation of the investment strategy for the long term horizon 
when the plans were initially funded in september  an amount estimated to cover the cash flow needs of upcoming benefit payments during fourth quarter and early was invested in a money market instrument 
the balance of the funding was invested on a equity and fixed income basis  consistent with our long term investment strategy 
our benefit committee recognizes that even though the investments are subject to short term volatility  it is critical that a long term investment focus be maintained 
this prevents ad hoc revisions to the philosophy and policies in reaction to short term market fluctuations 
in order to preserve this long term view  the committee will review performance of the investment funds quarterly and will review the asset allocation  including rebalancing  and investment policy statement annually 
to assure a rational  systematic  and cost effective approach to rebalancing  the committee has chosen certain trigger points as the maximum upper and lower limits for a specified asset class 
if the percentage of the plan s assets in a particular asset class has deviated from the target beyond a trigger point  the committee will rebalance the portfolio to bring all asset classes in line with the adopted guideline percentages 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or medicare act  was signed into law in december detailed regulations necessary to implement this act are still pending 
the 
table of contents medicare act provides medicare coverage for prescription drugs up to a certain amount above a deductible and then provides no medicare coverage until expenses reach a higher threshold 
the law also provides federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans 
companies that sponsor postretirement benefit plans are evaluating potential changes to their postretirement plans in order to take advantage of this new coverage and they are evaluating the accounting treatment of the various options provided by the act and of any changes to their plans 
the fasb has issued a fasb staff position  or fsp  that provides additional options to companies for the recognition of plan changes and requires certain disclosures pending further consideration of the underlying accounting principles 
refinery restructuring and other charges 
we have closed refineries and undertaken major restructurings of our general and administrative operations in recent years 
in order to identify and calculate the associated costs of these activities  management makes assumptions regarding estimates of shut down costs  equipment dismantling costs  the fair value of assets held for sale or disposal  employee severance costs  work force transition costs and other contractual arrangements 
prior to january   such costs were estimated and recorded as a liability on the date we made a commitment to an exit plan in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
restructuring liabilities are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjusted as additional information becomes available or based on changes in circumstances 
effective january   we adopted sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
we report activities associated with closed refineries and administrative restructuring as refinery restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations 
new accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the adoption of these standards has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
none of our market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading 
commodity risk our earnings  cash flow and liquidity are significantly affected by a variety of factors beyond our control  including the supply of  and demand for  commodities such as crude oil  other feedstocks  gasoline  other refined products and natural gas 
the demand for these refined products depends on  among other factors  changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  planned and unplanned downtime in refineries  pipelines and production facilities  production levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation 
as a result  the prices of these commodities fluctuate significantly 
the movement in petroleum prices does not necessarily have a direct long term relationship to net income 
the effect of changes in crude oil prices on our operating results is determined more by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect such changes 
we are required to fix the price on our crude oil purchases approximately one to several weeks prior to the time when the crude oil can be processed and sold 
as a result  we are exposed to crude oil price movements relative to refined product price movements during this period 
in  with the acquisition of our memphis refinery  our average fixed price purchase commitments when offset by our fixed price sale commitments increased to a net long inventory position of approximately million barrels 
as of december   if the market price of these net fixed price commitments had been lower by per barrel  we would have recorded 
table of contents additional cost of sales of approximately million  based on our treatment of these contracts as derivatives 
an increase in the market price would reduce cost of sales by a like amount 
we may actively mitigate some or all of the price risk related to our fixed price purchase and sale commitments 
these risk management decisions are based on many factors including the relative level and volatility of absolute hydrocarbon prices and the extent to which the futures market is in backwardation or contango 
when the contract price of the following month futures contract is less than the contract price of the current  or prompt  month contract  a backwardated market structure exists  and when the contract price of the following month futures contract is greater than the contract price of the prompt month contract  a contango market structure exists 
the cost of our risk management activities generally increases in a backwardated market 
as we look ahead to  we are reviewing our risk management program as we believe the cost of the program may exceed the benefit derived from this added layer of risk protection during less volatile oil market conditions 
we use several strategies to minimize the impact on profitability of volatility in feedstock costs and refined product prices 
these strategies generally involve the purchase and sale of exchange traded  energy related futures and options with a duration of six months or less 
to a lesser extent we use energy swap agreements similar to those traded on the exchanges  such as crack spreads and crude oil options  to better match the specific price movements in our markets 
these strategies are designed to minimize  on a short term basis  our exposure to the risk of fluctuations in crude oil prices and refined product margins 
the number of barrels of crude oil and refined products covered by such contracts varies from time to time 
such purchases and sales are closely managed and subject to internally established risk policies 
the results of these price risk mitigation activities affect refining cost of sales and inventory costs 
we do not engage in speculative futures or derivative transactions 
we prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk associated with our futures and options derivative positions 
this analysis may differ from actual results 
the fair value of each position was based on quoted futures prices 
as of december   a change in quoted futures prices would result in an approximate million change to the fair market value of the derivative commodity position and correspondingly the same change in operating income

our results may also be impacted by the write down of our lifo based inventory cost to market value when market prices drop dramatically compared to our lifo inventory cost 
these potential write downs may be recovered in subsequent periods as our inventories turn and market prices rise 
as of december  the replacement cost market value of our crude oil and refined product inventories exceeded the carrying value by million  or approximately per barrel over cost 
if the market value of these inventories had been lower by over per barrel as of december   we would have had to write down the value of our inventory

if the market value of these inventories had been lower by over per barrel as of december   we would have had to write down the value of our inventory 
most of our hydrocarbon inventories are valued using the lifo method  which are susceptible to a material write down when prices decline dramatically 
if prices decline significantly from year end levels  we may be required to write down the value of our lifo inventories in future periods 
our results are also sensitive to the fluctuations in natural gas prices due to the use of natural gas to fuel our refinery operations 
based on our average annual consumption of approximately million mmbtu of natural gas  a change per mmbtu in the price of natural gas would generally change our natural gas costs by million 
our sensitivity to a change in the price of natural gas would also be impacted by our method of purchasing natural gas 
we contract for the purchase of natural gas on a calendar month basis and set the price at the beginning of the month 
therefore  our natural gas costs will reflect the price of natural gas on the day the contract is set  and not the average price for the period 
we are reviewing options to mitigate our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations 

table of contents interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk is associated with our long term debt 
we manage this interest rate risk by maintaining a high percentage of our long term debt with fixed rates 
we have an outstanding balance of long term debt  including current maturities  of  million prg  million 
the weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate long term debt is prg 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our ohio bonds and any direct borrowings under our credit agreement 
as of december  and  a change in interest rates on our floating rate loans  which totaled million  would result in a million change in pretax income on an annual basis 
as of december  and  there were no cash borrowings under our credit agreement
