item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the formation transactions in connection with the closing of our initial public offering on april   we and geo  entered into a series of transactions which were designed to transfer ownership of eight correctional and detention facilities having an aggregate design capacity of  beds and owned and operated by geo to correctional properties 
the sale of these initial facilities to us was intended to provide a vehicle for possible future acquisitions of other facilities which geo owns or has a right to acquire  in addition to other facilities we may acquire  and to enable us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
in addition  during the period october to january  we acquired from geo three additional facilities for an aggregate purchase price equal to million 
these additional facilities have an aggregate design capacity of  beds 
for more information  please see relationship with the geo group below 
in connection with these formation transactions  all of the million of net proceeds received by us from our initial public offering were contributed by us directly to cpt operating partnership lp  a delaware limited partnership  to fund our investment in this operating partnership 
in exchange for this investment  we received a combined interest in the operating partnership 
this interest is structured such that we own directly a limited partnership interest and a general partnership interest in the operating partnership while cpt limited partner  inc  or cpt lp  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  owns the remaining limited partnership interest in the operating partnership 
at the same time we acquired these facilities  we leased them to the geo group or its affiliate who continue to operate the facilities 
please see structure of the company below 
the facilities are leased to the geo group or one of its affiliates under the terms of leases for an initial term of years 
subject to specified limited exceptions  the term of each of these leases may be extended by the geo group for three additional five year terms at a fair market rental rate as mutually agreed upon by us and the geo group or  in the absence of an agreement  as determined by binding arbitration 
in addition  the term of any of these leases will be automatically extended upon expiration of the term on the same terms including the then applicable base rent and base rent escalation as explained below as reflected in the applicable lease if there is at that time an unexpired sublease with respect to the respective facility 
under the terms of the leases with the geo group  the geo group has a day right of first refusal on the proposed sale by us of any of the facilities leased to it 
as a part of the formation transactions  we also entered into a right to purchase agreement with the geo group 
under this agreement  we have the right  during the years following our initial public offering  to acquire and lease back to the geo group any correctional or detention facilities which the geo group acquires or has the right to acquire 
these facilities are referred to in this report as the future facilities 
the rights set forth in the agreement are effective so long as there are any leases in force between us and the geo group and are subject to specified limited exceptions where the sale or transfer of ownership of a facility is restricted under a facility operating agreement or governmentally assisted financing arrangement 
under the terms of the right to purchase agreement  we may purchase a particular future facility at any time until the earlier of i a in the case of a newly developed future facility  four years from the receipt of a certificate of occupancy for the future facility or b in the case of an already operating future facility  four years from the date the future facility is acquired by the geo group or the party from which the geo group has the right to acquire the future facility  or 
table of contents ii six months after the future facility attains an occupancy level of of the number of beds authorized under the certificate of occupancy for the future facility  subject to certain limited exceptions 
the purchase price for each future facility will equal or other lower percentage as may be agreed to by the geo group of the total facility cost of that future facility  which may differ from the fair market value of that facility at the time we acquire it 
the total facility cost equals the aggregate costs related to the acquisition  development  design  construction  equipment and start up of the respective future facility 
the geo group has agreed that  with respect to goods or services provided by the geo group  these costs will not exceed the costs which would be paid if these goods and services had been purchased from a third party in an arm s length transaction 
in the case of any future facility acquired after the first five years following our initial public offering  the initial annual rental rate will be the fair market rental rate as mutually agreed upon by us and the geo group or as determined by binding arbitration if the parties cannot reach such agreement 
under the terms of any lease between us and the geo group relating to a future facility  the geo group has a thirty day right of first refusal on the proposed sale by us of any such future facility 
business and growth strategies operating and investment philosophy 
our business objectives are to maximize funds from operations and cash available for distribution to shareholders 
we strive to achieve these objectives by i pursuing investment opportunities with private prison operators and governmental entities for the financing  development  acquisition and lease back of correctional and detention facilities  ii working with tenants to identify opportunities to expand existing and newly acquired facilities  and iii structuring facility leases to include rent escalation provisions which provide for annual increases in rent 
acquisition opportunities 
we believe that  because of the increasing demand for additional prison beds and the lack of capital available to finance new facilities  opportunities exist to finance  acquire or develop correctional and detention facilities from or on behalf of private prison owners and operators and various government entities 
we may acquire from both private prison owners and operators and governmental entities additional correctional and detention facilities that meet our investment guidelines  as described in this report 
in addition  under the right to purchase agreement  we have the right to acquire and lease back to the geo group each of the future facilities during the applicable future facility option period 
however  notwithstanding the geo group s significant presence in the correctional and detention industry  less than of all adult prison beds in the united states are privately managed 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that further diversify our investments with respect to tenant base  underlying government entity and geographic location 
we believe that opportunities may exist to finance  acquire or develop correctional facilities from or on behalf of other private prison owners and operators and various governmental entities 
historically  government entities have used various methods of construction financing to develop new correctional and detention facilities  including but not limited to the following i one time general revenue appropriations by the government agency for the cost of the new facility  ii general obligation bonds that are secured by either a limited or unlimited tax levied by the issuing government entity or iii lease revenue bonds secured by an annual lease payment that is subject to annual or bi annual legislative appropriation of funds 
many jurisdictions are operating their correctional and detention facilities at well above their rated capacities  and as a result are under a federal court order to alleviate prison overcrowding within a certain time period 
these jurisdictions are often not in a position to appropriate funds or obtain financing to construct a new correctional or detention facility because of other fiscal demands or requirements for public approval 
accordingly  we believe that  in an attempt to address fiscal pressures of matching revenue collections with projected expenses  these government entities may consider private financing  development  and ownership of new correctional and detention facilities and sale leaseback transactions or other financing alternatives with respect to existing correctional and detention facilities 
we believe that these situations may enable us to finance  acquire and develop correctional or detention facilities from and on behalf of governmental agencies at all levels  including those which might not be the subject of a private management contract 

table of contents expansion opportunities 
we believe that there may be opportunities for expansion of our existing correctional facilities which could result in increased cash flows and property values 
we may use our capital to provide expansion space as requested by our tenants and expect that any such expansion of our facilities would result in correspondingly higher rental payments 
alternatively  a tenant may provide the capital for expansion  which should result in enhanced property values 
rent escalations 
all of our leases contain rent escalation provisions 
the geo group 
the base rent for the first year for each facility leased to the geo group before january  was equal to of the facility purchase price 
thereafter  minimum rent escalates by the greater of or the actual consumer price index  or cpi with a maximum increase of at the first two annual anniversaries of the effective date of each lease and by an amount equal to increases  if any  in the cpi at each successive annual anniversary for the remaining term of each lease  subject to a maximum increase of per annum throughout the term of the leases 
the base rent for the first year of the jena juvenile justice center leased to the geo group was equal to of the facility purchase price with a fixed annual escalator 
the average remaining life on the eleven leases with the geo group as of december   is approximately years 
state of north carolina leases 
in the year we acquired the pamlico facility and assumed the existing lease agreement with the state of north carolina which originally commenced in august  the base rent was equal to  or of the facility purchase price 
in the year we acquired the mountain view facility and assumed the existing lease agreement with the state of north carolina which originally commenced in december  the base rent was equal to  or of the facility purchase price 
in both cases  following the first year and continuing during the term of the leases and any renewal terms  base rent increases by the greater of  or the percentage of increase  if any  in the cpi  but not to exceed 
community education centers lease 
on may   we acquired delaney hall 
the initial base rent rate is  per annum or of the facility purchase price 
following the first year and continuing during the term of the lease  base rent increases by annually on each anniversary 
the operating partnership the operating partnership 
substantially all of our assets other than the mountain view and pamlico facilities are held by  and our operations conducted through  cpt operating partnership  lp  the operating partnership 
we are the sole general partner of the operating partnership and have the exclusive power under the governing partnership agreement to manage and conduct the business of the operating partnership 
our board of trustees manages our affairs by directing the affairs of the operating partnership 
our direct and  through cpt lp  indirect percentage interest in the operating partnership  is 
the operating partnership makes regular quarterly cash distributions to its partners  including us and cpt lp  in proportion to their percentage interests in the operating partnership 
we  in turn  pay cash distributions to our shareholders in an amount per common share equal to the amount distributed by the operating partnership 
the operating partnership was organized to facilitate the tax advantaged acquisition of additional correctional and detention facilities from private owners 
in the event we undertake such an acquisition  we contemplate that the owner of that facility would become a limited partner in the operating partnership and would be issued units of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership  representing an equal undivided fractional share of each item of the operating partnership s income  gain  and loss and in distribution of the operating partnership s assets as the consideration  in whole or in part  for the unitholder s transfer of the facility to the operating partnership 
we also contemplate that the unitholder would be given the right after a period of time to exchange units in the operating partnership for cash based upon their fair market value or  at our option  for our common shares on a one for one basis 
we also contemplate that substantially all our assets may be owned indirectly through the operating partnership so that one unit in the operating partnership would generally correspond economically to one common share 
in order to accomplish such objective  the current structure using the operating partnership was utilized  rather than us taking title to the initial facilities we acquired upon formation or subsequently acquired facilities 
this structure was implemented at our formation in order to avoid a re transfer in the future of these facilities to such a partnership which would result in associated transfer and other costs necessary or advisable in order to offer a private owner a tax advantaged acquisition vehicle 
currently  we and cpt lp are the only partners in the operating partnership and possess the power unilaterally to amend and 
table of contents restate the governing partnership agreement 
while there are no present plans to issue units to a private prison owner  we may pursue potential acquisitions which  if successful  could involve the issuance of units as a component of the consideration for the acquisitions 
we do not intend to use the operating partnership or any partnership which is owned by the operating partnership as a vehicle for tax advantaged acquisitions unless it receives an opinion of tax counsel to us that this use would not result in our disqualification as a reit  including an opinion that the operating partnership or any subsidiary partnership of the operating partnership would not be treated for federal income tax purposes as an association taxable as a corporation or a publicly traded partnership 
operating partnership agreement 
the operating partnership is organized as a delaware limited partnership under the terms of the governing partnership agreement which includes us  as general partner  and both us and cpt lp as the initial limited partners 
under the partnership agreement  we  as the sole general partner of the operating partnership  have full  exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership  and we and cpt lp  in the capacity as the limited partners  have no authority to transact business for  or participate in the management activities or decisions of  the operating partnership 
generally  any amendment to the partnership agreement may be made by the general partner  including  without limitation  amendments that i add to the obligations of the general partner  ii reflect the admission  substitution or withdrawal of partners  iii reflect the issuance of additional partnership interests issued by the operating partnership  iv reflect a change that does not adversely affect limited partners  and v are necessary to satisfy legal requirements 
the consent of each adversely affected partner is required for any amendment that would require any partner to make additional capital contributions or restore any negative balance in its capital account  or which amendment would convert a limited partnership interest into a general partnership interest  affect a limited partner s liability or right to receive distributions or that would dissolve the operating partnership prior to december  other than as a result of certain mergers or consolidations 
the partnership agreement requires that the operating partnership be operated in a manner that will enable us to satisfy the requirements for being classified as a reit

the provisions of some existing facility operating agreements between the geo group and the respective contracting governmental entities afford the governmental entity the right to assume a lease of the respective facility or designate another facility operator to assume the lease of the respective facility at a fixed rental rate in the event of the early termination of the facility operating agreement if specified events occur 
in these instances  the geo group has entered into a sublease for the subject facility with wccre llc  with wccre llc as the sublessor and the geo group as the sublessee 
the contracting governmental entity has the right to assume the rights of the geo group under this sublease on early termination of the operating agreement for the relevant facility 
however  even if a government entity elects to exercise its right to assume a sublease relating to a facility  the geo group is nevertheless liable to us under the master lease relating to the facility

design capacity measures the number of beds  and  accordingly  the number of inmates each facility is designed to accommodate 
occupancy rate measures the percentage of the number of beds which a facility is designed to accommodate which are occupied at any given time or for which payment has been guaranteed by the contracting governmental entity 
the facility operating agreement with respect to any facility may provide for occupancy less than the facility design capacity 
while the design capacity of each of the central valley community correctional facility  the golden state community correctional facility and the desert view community correctional facility is  the facility operating agreement for each such facility provides for the use and occupancy of only beds per facility 
the occupancy rates presented are as of december  we believe design capacity and occupancy rate are appropriate measures for evaluating prison operations because the revenues generated by each facility are generally based on a per diem or monthly rate per inmate housed at the facility paid by the corresponding contracting governmental entities 
the ability of the geo group  cec or another private prison operator to satisfy its financial obligations under its leases with us is based in part on the revenues generated by their facilities  which in turn depends on the design capacity and occupancy rate of each facility 
the state of north carolina is not obligated to report occupancy percentages to us 
we are not a party to the underlying operating agreement on each facility

this affords the governmental entity the ability to plan and effectuate an orderly relocation of its inmates to another facility in the event of early termination of its operating agreement with the geo group 
however  regardless of whether the sublease structure is created for an individual facility  the geo group  at all times  remains primarily liable to us under the leases 
leases each of the facilities that are leased to the geo group or wccre llc is the subject of a separate lease that incorporates the provisions of a master lease between us and the geo group 
the lease of each of these facilities includes the land  the buildings and structures and other improvements thereon  easements  rights and similar appurtenances to such land and improvements  and permanently affixed equipment  machinery  and other specified fixtures relating to the operation of the facility 
the lease of each of these facilities provides for an initial term of years and may be extended by the geo group for three additional five year terms beyond this fixed term at a fair market rental rate as mutually agreed upon by us and the geo group or as determined by binding arbitration if the parties cannot reach such an agreement 
in addition  an individual lease will be automatically extended on the same terms including the then applicable base rent and base rent escalation as reflected in the applicable lease if there is at that time an unexpired sublease with respect to the facility 
the fixed term and extended terms under each lease are subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of specified contingencies described in the lease 
any additional future facilities will be leased upon terms and conditions substantially similar to the above described leases except that the rental rate in the case of any future facility acquired during the first five years following our initial public offering will be the greater of i the fair market rental rate as mutually agreed upon by us and the geo group or by binding arbitration if the parties cannot reach such an agreement or ii of the applicable purchase price of the future facility 
in the case of any future facility acquired after the first five years following our initial public offering  the initial annual rental rate will be the fair market rental rate as mutually agreed upon by us and the geo group or as determined by binding arbitration if the parties cannot reach such an agreement 

table of contents use of the facilities 
each lease on the facilities permits the geo group to operate the leased property solely as a correctional or detention facility  unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by us and the geo group 
each lease held by the geo group is a triple net lease or absolute net lease meaning the geo group is required to pay base rent plus any additional charges related to the leased property  including all taxes  government charges  and all charges for utilities and services 
maintenance  modification and capital additions 
under each lease held by the geo group  the geo group is required  at its sole cost and expense  to maintain each leased property in good order  repair and appearance we are not required to build or rebuild any improvements to any property leased to the geo group  or to make any repairs  replacements  alterations  restorations or renewals to any leased property 
the geo group  at its sole cost and expense  may make alterations  additions  changes and or improvements to each leased property 
improvements which have a cost of more than  or which  when aggregated with the cost of all such improvements for any individual leased property in the same lease year  would cause the total cost of all such improvements to exceed  must receive our prior written consent and must not impair the value and primary intended use of the leased property the  and  threshold amounts are increased per year  cumulatively 
upon the expiration or earlier termination of the lease  we have an option to purchase at appraised market value all machinery  equipment  furniture  furnishings  and other personal property  which has been installed at the expense of the geo group on any leased property 
this option may be subject to a contracting governmental entity s superior right to acquire all or a portion of this removable personal property under the terms of its operating contract with the geo group 
each lease held by the geo group provides that  at the request of the geo group  we may construct capital additions  or improvements to a particular leased property  which are not normal or recurring to the maintenance of the leased property 
a capital addition to a leased property may necessitate changes in the premises  rent  or other similar terms of the lease which would be reflected in an amendment to the lease or a new lease agreement 
in specified situations  a capital addition may be made directly by the geo group and financed by third parties with our prior written consent 
we have an option to acquire and lease back to the geo group any capital additions that we have not undertaken or financed for a period of one year following the date the geo group first receives inmates or detainees in that capital addition 
the purchase price of the capital addition is required to be or a lower percentage if agreed to by the geo group of the cost of the capital addition 
fair market rental rates for any capital addition acquired or undertaken by us are mutually agreed upon by us and the geo group  or by binding arbitration if the parties cannot reach such an agreement 
insurance 
each lease with the geo group provides that the geo group is required to maintain insurance on each leased property under the geo group s insurance policies providing for the following coverages i fire  vandalism  earthquake and malicious mischief  extended coverage perils  and all physical loss perils  ii comprehensive general public liability including personal injury and property damage  iii loss of rental value or business interruption and iv workers compensation 
environmental matters 
each lease with the geo group provides that the geo group makes various representations and warranties relating to environmental matters with respect to each leased property 
each lease also requires the geo group to indemnify and hold harmless us and any holder of a mortgage  deed of trust or other security agreement on a leased property from and against all environmental liabilities  costs and expenses except those liabilities  costs and expenses that result from our gross negligence or intentional misconduct 
indemnification generally 
under each geo facility lease  except in circumstances involving the company s gross negligence or intentional misconduct  the geo group indemnifies  and is obligated to save harmless  the company from and against any and all demands  claims  causes of action  fines  penalties  damages including consequential damages  losses  liabilities including strict liability  judgments  and expenses including  without limitation  reasonable attorneys fees  court costs  and related expenses incurred in connection with or arising from i the use  condition  operation or occupancy of each leased property  ii any activity  work  or thing done  or permitted or suffered by the geo group in or about the leased property  iii any acts  omissions  or negligence of the geo group or any person claiming under the geo group  or the contractors  agents  employees  invitees  or visitors of the geo group or any such person  iv any claim of any person incarcerated  held or detained in the leased property  including claims alleging breach or violation of such person s civil or legal rights  v any breach  violation  or nonperformance by the geo group or the employees  agents  contractors  invitees  or visitors of the geo group  of any term  covenant  or provision of any lease or any law  ordinance  or governmental requirement of any kind  vi any injury or damage to the person  property or business of the geo group  its employees  agents  contractors  
table of contents invitees  visitors  or any other person entering upon the leased property under the express or implied invitation of the geo group  vii any accident  injury to or death of persons or loss of damage to any item of property occurring at the leased property 
events of default 
in the event of any event of default referable to a specific lease  we may evict the geo group from the respective leased property and either terminate the lease or re let the leased property 
however  we will have specified duties to mitigate our losses in the exercise of these remedies 
in either event  the geo group shall remain responsible for the rent provided in the lease for this leased property for the remaining period of the term in excess of rents received by us from any successor occupant 
alternatively  at our option  we will be entitled to recover all unpaid rent then due plus the present value of the rent for the unexpired term at the time of the award 
this will be subject to our obligation to deliver and pay to the geo group any net rentals or proceeds actually received from the lease  sale or other disposition of the leased property thereafter  up to the amount paid by the geo group 
in addition  we may exercise any other rights that we may have under law 
in the event we evict the geo group from a leased property  the master lease will remain in full force and effect for all other leased properties 
with respect to the geo group s failure to timely pay rent and with respect to specified nonmonetary events of default under the master lease  we shall have all of the foregoing rights  remedies and obligations with respect to all of the leased facilities 
because the facilities are located in various states  the leases may be subject to restrictions imposed by applicable local law 
neither the master lease nor any of the other agreements entered into by the geo group in connection with the formation transactions prohibits or otherwise restricts our ability to lease properties to parties domestic or foreign other than the geo group 
because the leases on the facilities are triple net leases  which impose significant burdens upon the tenant and provide for an escalating annual base rent  the leases do not satisfy the requirements of these governmental entities or allow the geo group the flexibility to tailor the lease provisions to the terms of a particular request for proposals  or rfp 
in these instances  the geo group requests that we enter into the lease with wccre llc  which in turn enters into a more basic fixed rental rate sublease with the geo group  which sublease meets the requirements of the contracting governmental entity  and permits the contracting governmental entity to assume such sublease in the event of early termination of the operating agreement for the relevant facility 
the provisions of all subleases are subject to our review and approval 
we have leased the following facilities to wccre llc  each of which in turn is subleased to the geo group the central valley facility  the golden state facility  the desert view facility and the mcfarland facility 
we have leased the following facilities directly to the geo group the queens facility  the aurora facility  the hobbs facility  the lawton facility and the karnes facility 
assignment and subletting 
the leases with the geo group provide that generally the geo group may not  without our prior written consent  assign  sublease  mortgage  pledge  hypothecate  encumber or otherwise transfer except to an affiliate of the geo group any lease or any interest in the lease  or all or any part of the leased property 
the leases further provide that except with respect to governmental subleases meeting specified requirements our consent may be granted or withheld in our sole discretion 
any change of control of the geo group will be treated as an assignment of a lease for these purposes 
the leases further provide that no assignment or sublease will in any way impair the continuing primary liability of the geo group under the leases 
in addition  if requested by the geo group in order to respond to a rfp for an operating agreement  we may agree to provide nondisturbance agreements in favor of governmental entities under the terms of which we will agree to recognize and leave the rights of any governmental sub tenant undisturbed in the event of a termination of the lease  but only upon our determination that the provisions of any of these governmental subleases are acceptable in our sole and absolute discretion 
subleases the rental payments and other material terms of the existing subleases differ from comparable provisions of the leases  and there is no requirement that the governmental entity or its designee comply with the provisions of the leases 
in these cases  the geo group will  nevertheless  remain primarily liable to us under the leases 

table of contents in connection with the conveyance of the facilities under the terms of the leases  we will agree to recognize and leave undisturbed the subleasing rights of the governmental entities 
these subleases are presently in effect with respect to the mcfarland facility  the central valley facility  the desert view facility  and the golden state facility 
the geo group has agreed that the term of the individual leases between the geo group and us for these facilities will be automatically extended  if necessary  in order to insure that the lease between us and the geo group will be commensurate with the term of any such subleases 
some of the material differences between the terms and provisions of the existing subleases and the leases are discussed below 
the california facilities subleases 
wccre llc has entered into a series of subleases with the geo group for the use of the california facilities 
in connection with our initial public offering  we entered into a series of leases with wccre llc under the terms of which we will recognize and agree to leave undisturbed the california subleases 
except for the base rent  the terms and provisions of each of the california subleases are identical 
with the exception of the sublease of the mcfarland facility which expired in january  the term of each of the california subleases is months expiring december  and is coterminous with a ten year facility operating agreement entered into between the geo group and the state of california for each of these facilities 
each of the california subleases provides for specified termination rights in favor of the state of california under which the state of california has the option  in the event of early termination of the operating agreement between the state of california and the geo group  to cause the geo group s interest under each of the california subleases to be assigned to the state of california or to a replacement operator approved by the state 
the california subleases may not be modified without the prior written approval of the state of california 
while the california subleases are triple net leases  the provisions of these subleases are generally not as favorable to the lessor as the comparable provisions of the relevant leases 
if the geo group defaults on its obligations under the leases  we will be required to permit the contracting government entity to occupy the california facilities under the provisions of the sublease 
the annual base rent under the sublease is not subject to adjustment for cost of living increases or any other reason 
as a result  the annual rent payable under the california subleases may  during some portion of the term of the applicable master leases  fall below the annual rent payable under such leases 
the geo group will nevertheless remain obligated to us for performance under these leases for the entire term of the california subleases

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we were formed in february as a maryland real estate investment trust to capitalize on the growing trend toward privatization in the corrections industry by acquiring correctional and detention facilities from both private prison operators and governmental entities and leasing these facilities to experienced correctional and detention facility operators or the governmental entities under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases leases where the tenant is required to pay all operating expenses  taxes  insurance  structural and non structural repairs and other costs 
our principal business strategy is to finance and acquire correctional and detention facilities that meet our investment criteria  from both private prison managers  developers and government entities  to expand our existing facilities  and to lease all of these facilities under long term leases to qualified third party operators 
with the exception of the mountain view facility and pamlico facility  our remaining facilities are privately managed facilities that are leased to and operated by the geo group  inc or community educations center  inc  or cec 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from i rents received under triple net leases of correctional and detention facilities  and ii interest earned from the temporary investment of funds in short term investments 
a component of the rental revenue we receive consists of increases resulting from rent escalation provisions which appear in all of our leases the geo group 
the base rent for the first year for each facility leased to the geo group before january  was equal to of the facility purchase price 
thereafter  minimum rent escalates by the greater of or actual cpi with a maximum increase of at the first two annual anniversaries of the effective date of each lease and by an amount equal to increases  if any  in the cpi at each successive annual anniversary for the remaining term of each lease  subject to a maximum increase of per annum throughout the term of the leases 
the base rent for the first year of the jena juvenile justice center leased to the geo group was equal to of the facility purchase price with a fixed annual escalator 
the average remaining life on the eleven leases with the geo group as of december   is approximately years 
state of north carolina leases 
in the year we acquired the pamlico facility and assumed the existing lease agreement with the state of north carolina which originally commenced in august  the base rent was equal to  or of the facility purchase price 
in the year we acquired the mountain view facility and assumed the existing lease agreement with the state of north carolina which originally commenced in december  the base rent was equal to  or of the facility purchase price 
in both cases  following the first year and continuing during the term of the leases and any renewal terms  base rent increases by the greater of  or the percentage of increase  if any  in the cpi  but not to exceed 
community education centers lease 
on may   we acquired delaney hall 
the initial base rent rate is  per annum or of the facility purchase price 
following the first year and continuing during the term of the lease  base rent increases by annually on each anniversary 
we incur operating and administrative expenses  including compensation expense for our executive officers and other employees  office rental and related occupancy costs and various expenses incurred in the process of acquiring additional properties 
we are self administered and managed by our executive officers and staff  and do not engage a separate advisor or pay an advisory fee for administrative or investment services  although we do engage legal  accounting  tax and financial advisors from time to time 
our primary non cash expense is depreciation of our correctional and detention facilities 

table of contents we have leveraged and anticipate having to continue to leverage our portfolio of real estate equity investments  and expect to continue to incur short term indebtedness and related interest expense 
we may also incur long term indebtedness to make acquisitions  and or refinance correctional facilities currently owned 
we intend to make distributions to our shareholders in amounts not less than the amounts required to maintain reit status under the internal revenue code 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in its financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  depreciation of real estate  impairment of long lived assets  the accounting for interest rate swaps and stock options 
application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and  as a result  future results could differ from these estimates 
for additional information  please see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term including the impact of scheduled rent increases which are determinable in amount at the inception of the lease 
any increases in lease revenue due to scheduled rent increases which were not determinable at the inception of the lease will be recognized when determinable 
scheduled rent increases which are not determinable at lease inception are dependent upon increases in the consumer price index  or cpi 
depreciation of real estate real estate properties are recorded at cost 
acquisition costs and transaction fees directly related to each property are capitalized as a cost of the respective property 
the purchase price of properties is allocated to tangible and intangible assets based on their respective values 
the tangible cost of real estate properties acquired is allocated between land  buildings and improvements  and machinery and equipment based upon cost at time of acquisition 
depreciation is provided for on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life ranging from years for buildings and improvements 
we are required to make subjective evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our properties  which directly impacts our net income 
impairment of long lived assets we review the recorded value of our real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset in question may not be recoverable 
we have reviewed our long lived assets and have determined that there are no events requiring impairment loss recognition 
the method used to determine impairment would be based on estimates of undiscounted operating cash flows over the remaining amortization period for the related long lived assets 
we would measure impairment as the difference between fair value and the net book value of the related asset 
interest rate swaps in accordance with the amended bank credit facility  we utilize interest rate swap derivative instruments to manage changes in market conditions related to interest rate payments on certain of our variable rate bank debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps exchange floating interest rate libor payments on specified established notional amounts for fixed rate interest payments on the same notional amounts 
we recognize our interest rate swap derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value  which is determined by the counter party  as either an asset or a liability 
we determined the interest rate swaps to be effective cash flow hedges  and therefore  changes in the fair value of these swap agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a component of shareholders equity 

table of contents stock options we account for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for our employee stock plans because the exercise prices of the stock options equal the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant 
had compensation for our stock based compensation plans been determined pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  our net income and earnings per share would have decreased accordingly 
for additional information  please see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies employee stock based compensation plans and note share option and incentive plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the year ended december  financial condition results of operations compared with for the twelve months ended december   rental revenues increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in rental revenues resulted primarily from the acquisition of delaney hall on may   which increased rental revenue by million 
the balance of the increase was primarily due to rent escalations  based on the consumer price index  on some of the facilities of approximately million and a one time  cumulative non recurring cpi rent escalation adjustment of approximately million on certain of the facilities leased to the geo group 
depreciation for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  depreciation associated with the delaney hall facility resulted in the increase in depreciation from to general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits  insurance  professional fees and board of trustee fees 
interest expense decreased to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest on our amended bank credit facility as a result of the paying down of the outstanding balance in july using the proceeds from the secondary public offering 
compared with for the twelve months ended december   rental revenues increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in rental revenues resulted primarily from revenue associated with the mountain view facility  purchased on march   and the pamlico facility  purchased on june   which increased rental revenue by million and million  respectively 
the balance of the increase was primarily due to rent escalations  based on the consumer price index  on some of the remaining facilities 
depreciation for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  depreciation associated with the mountain view facility and pamlico facility resulted in the increase in depreciation from to general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  decreased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees 
interest expense increased to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase is primarily due to interest on the bonds issued by a wholly owned 
table of contents subsidiary of ours on june  in connection with the refinancing of the mountain view facility and the acquisition of the pamlico facility offset by a reduction in interest on our credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operations 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to make distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
all facilities owned by us are leased under triple net leases  which require the lessees to pay substantially all expenses associated with the operation of these facilities 
as a result of these arrangements  we do not believe we will be responsible for any major expenses in connection with the facilities during the terms of the leases 
on november   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the terms of which govern our new amended bank credit facility initially consisting of a million secured revolving credit facility 
the amended bank credit facility has a term of months and replaces our initial secured line of credit which matured on october  but was extended up until the closing of the amended bank credit facility 
the proceeds of the amended bank credit facility may be used to finance the construction and the acquisition of correctional and detention facilities  to expand or improve current facilities and for general working capital purposes 
the amended bank credit facility includes a swing line component and provisions to increase the amended bank credit facility up to a total of million by increasing the revolver  and or by originating a new term loan of up to million  subject to successful syndication and other specified closing conditions 
the amended bank credit facility is secured by our facilities  other than the queens facility and the north carolina facilities  and permits aggregate borrowings of up to of the total value of the facilities  ie the pledge pool  which is calculated as the lesser of the aggregate of the historical cost of our facilities or the aggregate of the appraised value of those facilities 
under the terms of the amended bank credit facility  we are restricted from paying dividends in excess of a the lesser of of cash available for distribution or of funds from operations plus  in either case b of the amount of any capital gain from dispositions of facilities 
the amended bank credit facility includes a requirement that we enter into specified interest rate swap agreements for a portion of the amounts drawn  which effectively fixes the interest rate on a significant portion of the borrowings 
our ability to borrow under the amended bank credit facility is subject to our compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative restrictive covenants and other requirements including certain financial covenants with respect to our consolidated net worth and interest coverage ratio and limits on capital expenditures and borrowings in addition to other restrictions 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under the amended bank credit facility bear interest at either a base rate or eurodollar rate at our option 
the base rate is equal to the sum of a the higher of i the federal funds rate plus and ii the prime rate plus b the base rate applicable margin  which ranges from to basis points depending upon our ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated total assets 
the eurodollar rate is equal to libor plus the eurodollar rate applicable margin  which ranges from to basis points depending upon our ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated total assets 
the interest period on eurodollar rate loans is based on interest periods of one  two  three  six or nine months at our option 
the applicable margins for base rate loans and eurodollar rate loans described above were and at december   respectively 
economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  which could increase debt service requirements on borrowings under the amended bank credit facility and which could  in turn  reduce the amount of cash available for distribution 
upon the closing of the amended bank credit facility  we paid fees and expenses of approximately million 
as of december   the amount of outstanding indebtedness under the amended bank credit facility was million 
as of december   we had million available borrowing capacity  including million  which is currently available to be drawn on the swing line component for general working capital requirements 
in order for a facility to be initially included in the pledge pool  the lessee of the facility must be in full compliance with the material terms and conditions contained in the operating or management contract with the governmental agency 
however  in the event that any facility  after becoming a part of the pledge pool  becomes vacant that property shall continue to be included in the pledge pool so long as the lease agreement with respect to such property is in full force and effect and the inclusion of that property in the pledge pool would not cause the sum of the appraised values of all vacant properties in the pledge pool to exceed of the total value of the pledge pool as calculated above 
the geo group does not presently have a correctional facility operating or management contract with a governmental agency for the jena facility and the mcfarland facility 
however  the geo group continues to make rental payments to us as 
table of contents required under the terms of the non cancelable leases 
the appraised value of these two facilities is approximately ten percent of the total value of the facilities as calculated above  and therefore  does not exceed of the total value 
as a result  both of these facilities continue to be included in the pledge pool 
each of our facilities are leased under triple net leases in which the tenant is required to pay all the operating expenses  taxes  insurance  and structural and non structural repairs and other costs 
as a result  we have no commitments with respect to other capital expenditures on our existing facilities 
we have an agreement under which we may acquire  at a price of up to of cost  and lease back to the geo group  any correctional or detention facility acquired or developed and owned by the geo group  subject to specified limited exceptions  and subject to time constraints on each specific property 
currently there are no properties of the geo group eligible for purchase pursuant to this agreement 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of real property development and acquisitions by borrowing under our amended bank credit facility and by issuing equity or debt securities in public or private transactions 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain financing for our long term capital needs 
however  we cannot assure you that this additional financing or capital will be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may  under some circumstances  borrow additional amounts in connection with the renovation or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of additional properties  or as necessary  to meet certain distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code 
on june   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  under rule under the securities act of  as amended  which is now effective 
we may  from time to time  offer our common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  which may be senior or subordinated  depositary shares and warrants to acquire any of the foregoing 
these securities may only be offered in amounts  at prices and on terms to be set forth in the prospectus contained in the registration statement  and in one or more supplements to the prospectus 
the registration statement is intended to provide us flexibility to raise up to million from the offering of these securities  subject to market conditions and capital needs 
net proceeds from the offering may be used by us to acquire correctional properties  repay outstanding debt  and for general working capital purposes 
in july  we completed a public offering of  common shares at per share  under our shelf registration statement 
the gross proceeds from the offering of  less expenses of  which includes underwriters fees and expenses associated with the offering  generated net proceeds to us of approximately  the net proceeds of the offering were used to pay down the outstanding balance of our amended bank credit facility 
the bonds issued in to acquire the pamlico facility and refinance the mountain view facility require quarterly payments of principal and interest 
the total quarterly principal payments due in on the bonds are  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table aggregates our expected contractual obligations and commitments after december  payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years debt operating lease at december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
funds from operations we believe funds from operations  or ffo  is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 

table of contents we compute ffo in accordance with the current standards established by the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the white paper defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements the following table presents a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands net income real estate depreciation funds from operations common shares outstanding basic diluted item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks inherent in our financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and relate to our acquisitions and financing of correctional and detention facilities 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing amended bank credit facility and any future financing requirements 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with the amended bank credit facility agreement and board approved policies 
our interest rate risk is related primarily to the variable rates of our amended bank credit facility  which we seek to reduce by entering into the interest rate swaps 
we are also exposed to market risk from i the interest rate risk on short term borrowings  ii the possibility of non performance by the counter parties to the interest rate swaps which we do not anticipate  iii our ability to refinance our amended bank credit facility at maturity and iv the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate financing to fund our existing properties and future acquisitions 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis and may in the future seek to minimize interest rate exposure 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective  we enter into interest rate swaps and seek long term financing 
as of december    had been drawn on the amended bank credit facility at an average rate of based upon the base rate under the amended bank credit facility 
no indebtedness under the amended bank credit facility greater than days in duration existed as of december  holding the variable rate outstanding debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of would result in an increase in interest expense for fiscal year of approximately  the bonds outstanding at december  of  under the trust indenture are non recourse to us and non recourse to our subsidiary  which is the obligor under the bonds  and non recourse to the subsidiary s sole member  cpt operating partnership lp  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum
