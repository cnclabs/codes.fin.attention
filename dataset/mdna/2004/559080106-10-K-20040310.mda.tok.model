item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
magellan midstream partners  lp  formerly williams energy partners lp  is a publicly traded limited partnership formed to own  operate and acquire a diversified portfolio of complementary energy assets 
we are principally engaged in the transportation  storage and distribution of refined petroleum products 
our current asset portfolio consists of a  mile refined petroleum products pipeline system with terminals  five marine terminal facilities  inland terminals six of which were acquired during january as discussed in recent developments below  and an  mile ammonia pipeline system 
during april  we acquired magellan pipeline company  llc magellan pipeline  which comprises the majority of our petroleum products pipeline system  for approximately billion from a wholly owned subsidiary of the williams companies  inc williams 
because williams was an affiliate of ours at the time of the acquisition  the transaction was between entities under common control and  as such  was accounted for similar to a pooling of interest 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements and notes have been restated to reflect the historical results of operations  financial position and cash flows of this pipeline system and us on a combined basis throughout the periods presented 
significant events on june   williams sold its interest in us to magellan midstream holdings  lp mmh  a new entity jointly formed by private equity firms madison dearborn capital partners iv  llc and carlyle riverstone mlp holdings  lp mmh acquired million of our common units  million subordinated units  million class b common units and of the ownership interest in our general partner 
the change in majority ownership of this transaction resulted in the following items  primarily due to our separation from williams effective september   we began doing business as magellan midstream partners  lp and changed our new york stock exchange ticker symbol to mmp  based on previous agreements between williams and us  williams had responsibility for providing our general and administrative g a services  which included functions such as commercial operations  engineering  information technology  finance  accounting  human resources and other corporate services 
we paid a specified cash cost for these services  excluding expenses associated with our equity based incentive plans  with the capped amount escalating annually 
williams was responsible for paying any cost related to these services in excess of the amount we paid to them 
as a result of the sale of williams interests in us  these agreements with williams terminated 
mmh agreed to continue providing g a services to us and we incur the same cash cost  which was equivalent to million on an annual basis at december   excluding expenses associated with our equity based incentive plans 
mmh will reimburse us for amounts that exceed the cap 
the cap will escalate at annually and will further increase for incremental g a costs associated with acquisitions we complete  under the new organization structure put in place after mmh s acquisition of us  we can now clearly identify all g a costs required to support ourselves 
actual cash g a costs incurred by us will continue to be limited to the g a cap and the amount of costs above the cap that mmh must pay will be recorded as a capital contribution by our general partner 
we recorded expense of approximately million for the period june  to december  related to the reimbursable g a 
the reimbursable g a expense will not impact earnings per unit for the limited partners as the costs above the cap are allocated entirely to our general partner s net income 
in addition  the reimbursable g a expense will not impact cash available for distribution as these costs are reimbursed to us by our affiliate  we recorded a million affiliate liability during for paid time off benefits associated with employees supporting us 
prior to june   this liability had been recorded on the balance sheet of williams 
the corresponding expenses did not impact cash available for distribution in as part of our separation from williams  we paid for million of transition costs primarily to establish our own g a functions and change our name 
in addition  we incurred million of preparatory costs associated with the transition and upgrade related to our financial accounting systems 
therefore  we were responsible for funding million of the transition costs with any incremental transition costs above this amount recorded as a capital contribution by our general partner 
during  transition costs totaled million 
we recorded million of this amount as expense and million to property  plant and equipment 
the costs in excess of million will not impact cash available for distributions or earnings per unit for the limited partners as the costs above our million responsibility is allocable entirely to our general partner 
we expect to incur approximately million of transition costs during  and mmh assumed million of the environmental indemnifications from williams associated with known environmental liabilities as of march  therefore  amounts recorded in our financial statements associated with these known liabilities are now indemnified by mmh 
we will seek reimbursement from williams for other environmental liabilities and environmental capital expenditures in excess of this amount that qualify for reimbursement 
in late december  mmh sold  common units and we sold  common units in an underwritten public offering 
mmh sold an additional  common units in january  when the underwriters exercised their over allotment option 
the net proceeds from our sale of the  units  after transaction costs and underwriting commissions  were million 
we also received a million contribution from mmh to maintain its general partner interest 
proceeds from these transactions will be used for general partnership purposes 
following these transactions  mmh has an approximate ownership interest in us  including its general partner interest 
recent developments on january   the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of per unit for the period of october through december  the fourth quarter distribution represents a increase over the fourth quarter distribution of per unit and a increase since our initial public offering in february the distribution was paid on february  to unitholders of record on february  on january   we announced our acquisition of ownership interests in inland terminals located in the southeastern united states for million 
we previously owned a interest in eight of these terminals and acquired the remaining ownership interest in these eight terminals from murphy oil usa  inc in addition  we acquired sole ownership of six terminals that had been jointly owned by murphy oil usa  inc and colonial pipeline company 
in february  we entered into three separate agreements with two different banks for forward starting interest rate swaps totaling million 
the swaps begin in october  when we expect to refinance the majority of magellan pipeline s million senior secured notes 
under the swap agreements  we will pay fixed interest rates and will receive libor for a ten year period  which is the assumed tenure of replacement debt 
the average fixed rate on the swaps is 
on march   we acquired a ownership in osage pipe line company  llc  which owns the osage pipeline  for million from national cooperative refinery association ncra 
the mile osage pipeline transports crude oil from cushing  oklahoma to el dorado  kansas and has connections to the ncra refinery in mcpherson  kansas and the frontier refinery in el dorado  kansas 
the remaining interest in the osage pipe line company  llc will continue to be owned by ncra 
overview in  our cash flow significantly exceeded our debt service obligations and cash distributions to our unitholders 
our petroleum products pipeline system generates a substantial portion of this cash flow 
the revenues generated from the petroleum products pipeline business are significantly influenced by demand for refined petroleum products  which has been growing in the markets we serve 
in addition  expenses for this business are principally fixed and relate to routine maintenance and system integrity work as well as field and support personnel cost 
we expect to maintain or grow the cash flow of the petroleum products pipeline system as well as our other businesses in the future 
however  a prolonged period of high refined product prices could lead to a reduction in demand and result in lower shipments on our pipeline system 
in addition  increased pipeline maintenance regulations  higher power costs and higher interest rates could decrease the amount of cash we generate 
petroleum products pipeline system 
our petroleum products pipeline system is a common carrier transportation pipeline and terminals network 
the system generates approximately of its revenues  excluding the sale of petroleum products  through transportation tariffs for volumes of petroleum products it ships 
these tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates  where ultimate delivery occurs and any applicable discounts 
all transportation rates and discounts are in published tariffs filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the petroleum products pipeline system also earns revenues from non tariff based activities  including leasing pipeline and storage tank capacity to shippers on a long term basis and by providing data services and product services such as ethanol unloading and loading  additive injection  custom blending and laboratory testing 
our petroleum products pipeline system generally does not produce  trade or take title to the products it transports 
however  the system does generate small volumes of product through its fractionation activities 
in july  we purchased a petroleum products management operation from williams and we now take title to the associated inventories and resulting products 
from april through june  we did not purchase and take title to the inventories or resulting products associated with this operation but performed services related to this operation for an annual fee of approximately million 
we also purchase and fractionate transmix and sell the resulting separated products 
operating costs and expenses incurred by the petroleum products pipeline system are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance and system integrity as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported and stored on the system 
expenses resulting from environmental remediation projects have historically included costs from projects relating both to current and past events 
in connection with our acquisition of this pipeline system  an affiliate of williams agreed to indemnify us for costs and expenses relating to environmental remediation for events that occurred before april  and are discovered within six years from that date 
see business environmental under item of this k report 
petroleum products terminals 
within our terminals network  we operate two types of terminals marine terminal facilities and inland terminals 
the marine terminal facilities are large product storage facilities that generate revenues primarily from fees that we charge customers for storage and throughput services 
the inland terminals earn revenues primarily from fees we charge based on the volumes of refined petroleum products distributed from these terminals 
the inland terminals also earn ancillary revenues from injecting additives into gasoline and jet fuel and filtering jet fuel 
operating costs and expenses that we incur in our marine and inland terminals are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with storage utilization or throughput levels 
ammonia pipeline system 
the ammonia pipeline system earns the majority of its revenue from transportation tariffs that we charge for transporting ammonia through the pipeline 
effective february  we entered into an agreement with a third party pipeline company to operate our ammonia pipeline system 
operating costs and expenses charged to us are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance as well as field personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported on the pipeline 
acquisition history we have increased our operations through a series of acquisitions in march  the acquisition of a ownership interest in osage pipeline  in january  the acquisition of six inland terminals and the remaining ownership interest in eight terminals  and in july  the acquisition of the petroleum products management business from a subsidiary of williams  in april  the acquisition of the  mile petroleum products pipeline system from a subsidiary of williams  in december  the acquisition of a natural gas liquids pipeline in illinois from aux sable liquid products lp  in october  the acquisition of a marine crude oil terminal facility in gibson  louisiana from geonet gathering  inc  in june  the acquisition of two inland refined petroleum products terminals in little rock  arkansas from transmontaigne  inc  and in april  the acquisition of a refined petroleum products pipeline in dallas  texas from equilon pipeline company llc  which is part of our petroleum products terminals segment  results of operations the non generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial measure of operating margin is presented below 
the components of operating margin are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit  which is its nearest comparable gaap financial measure  is included in the table below 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
operating margin is an important performance measure of the economic success of our core operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by management in deciding how to allocate capital resources between segments 
operating profit  alternatively  includes expense items that management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of an operation such as depreciation and g a costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  financial highlights in millions revenues transportation and terminals revenue petroleum products pipeline system petroleum products terminals ammonia pipeline system total transportation and terminals revenue product sales affiliate management fees total revenues operating expenses  environmental expenses and environmental reimbursements petroleum products pipeline system petroleum products terminals ammonia pipeline system eliminations total operating expenses  environmental expenses and environmental reimbursements product purchases operating margin depreciation and amortization affiliate general and administrative expenses operating profit operating statistics petroleum products pipeline system transportation revenue per barrel shipped cents per barrel transportation barrels shipped million barrels barrel miles billions petroleum products terminals marine terminal facilities average storage capacity utilized per month barrels in millions throughput barrels in millions inland terminals throughput barrels in millions ammonia pipeline system volume shipped tons in thousands transportation and terminals revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was a result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily attributable to a higher weighted average tariff and increased volumes during the current period 
the higher transportation rates per barrel principally resulted from tariff increases during july and april tariff adjustments generally occur during july of each year  as allowed by the ferc 
however  the april increase was allowed by the ferc due to a change to the mid year ferc defined tariff calculation 
the incremental volume resulted from the short term refinery production decreases in the mid continent region of the us these production decreases resulted in substitute volumes from alternative sources moving through our pipeline system 
further  increased revenues from higher data service fees as well as greater capacity lease utilization and other ancillary revenues benefited the current year  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million  or  primarily due to increased throughput at our inland terminals as volumes of a former affiliate were more than replaced with higher volumes from third party customers 
utilization at the gulf coast marine facilities was lower between the two periods due to the termination of a former affiliate s storage agreement at our galena park  texas facility during the first quarter of increased revenues from the million settlement we received were more than offset by the resulting reduced storage utilization  and a decrease in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily due to significantly reduced transportation volumes during the first quarter of resulting from extremely high prices for natural gas  the primary component in the production of ammonia 
partially offsetting this volume decline was a higher weighted average tariff in operating expenses  environmental expenses and environmental reimbursements combined were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was associated with the affiliate paid time off benefits liability associated with operations employees and was recorded in conjunction with the change in ownership of our general partner 
by business segment  this increase was the result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  or  in part due to a million affiliate paid time off benefits accrual 
operating expenses further increased due to the retirement of assets and increased costs for tank maintenance and pipeline testing associated with the ongoing implementation of our system integrity program 
increased power costs resulting from higher transportation volumes and power rates as well as higher ad valorem taxes also resulted in greater costs during  a decrease in petroleum products terminals expenses of million  or  primarily due to reduced maintenance expenses resulting from efficiency projects that lowered contract labor and repair costs 
timing of tank inspection and cleaning further resulted in reduced maintenance expenses during these positive variances were partially offset by a charge associated with the retirement of an asset  a million affiliate paid time off benefits accrual and increased ad valorem taxes  and a decrease in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily due to the purchase in of right of way easements that have historically been leased 
revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in a net margin of million in the net margin represents an increase of million compared to a net margin in of million resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the increase in primarily reflects the margin results from our acquisition of the petroleum products management operation during july from april through june  we provided services related to this operation for an affiliate of williams for an annual fee rather than generating a commodity margin 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  representing a million increase from at million due to the additional depreciation associated with acquisitions and capital improvements 
g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
million of this increase was associated with one time costs resulting from the change in ownership of our general partner during as follows million was associated with the separation of our g a functions from williams  which primarily included the creation of our information technology systems and benefits programs  million was related to recording an affiliate paid time off benefits liability associated with g a employees  and million was associated with the early vesting of units granted under our and equity based incentive compensation plan resulting from the change in control of our general partner 
million was associated with g a costs in excess of the g a cap that will be reimbursed by mmh 
as described above in significant events  as a result of the change in our organizational structure we are now able to clearly identify all g a costs required to support ourselves and total g a costs  including those costs above the cap amount that will be reimbursed by mmh  are recorded as our expense 
under the previous structure  we were unable to identify specific costs required to support our operations  consequently  we recorded as expense only the g a costs under the cap  which reflected our actual cash cost 
the actual cash g a costs we incur will continue to be limited to the g a cap and the amount of costs above the cap will be recorded as a capital contribution by our general partner 
net interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily related to the replacement during the fourth quarter of of short term debt financing associated with the acquisition of our petroleum products pipeline system with long term debt at higher interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings increased from in to in with the average debt outstanding increasing from million in to million in debt placement fee amortization declined from million in to million in during the period  the short term debt associated with our acquisition of the petroleum products pipeline system was outstanding with related debt costs amortized over the month period that the debt was outstanding 
our subsequent long term debt financing costs are amortized over the year life of the notes 
we do not pay income taxes because we are a partnership 
however  earnings from the petroleum products pipeline system were subject to income taxes prior to our acquisition of it in april taxes on these earnings were at income tax rates of for the year ended december   based on the effective income tax rate for williams as a result of williams tax sharing arrangement with its subsidiaries 
the effective income tax rate exceeds the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  primarily due to million of one time costs associated with the change in ownership of our general partner  of which million was operating expense and was g a expense 
our net income further declined due to an additional million of reimbursable g a costs 
our operating margin increased by million over the prior year despite the million of one time operating expense items  largely as a result of increased transportation volumes and rates on our petroleum products pipeline system  increased product margin associated with the purchase of our petroleum products management operation in july and reduced operating expenses associated with the petroleum products terminals 
depreciation and net interest expense increased by million and million  respectively  while debt placement fee amortization expense decreased million 
other income declined million primarily due to a gain on the sale of assets during income taxes decreased million due to our partnership structure

this increase was the result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million  or 
transportation revenues increased between periods due to higher weighted average tariffs that more than offset slightly lower shipments 
the tariffs were higher due to a mid year rate increase and our customers transporting products longer distances 
these longer hauls resulted primarily from supply shifts within our pipeline system during the latter part of caused by temporary reductions of refinery production on our system 
further  increased rates for data services as well as higher ethanol loading and storage volumes resulted in additional revenue  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million  or  primarily due to the acquisitions of our gibson marine terminal facility in october and two little rock inland terminals in june an improved marketing environment resulted in higher utilization and rates at our gulf coast facilities  further increasing revenues during  and a decrease in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily due to a throughput deficiency billing in the prior year that resulted from a shipper s inability to meet its minimum annual throughput commitment for the contract year ended june in addition  revenue also declined due to significantly reduced volumes from one of our shippers following its filing for chapter bankruptcy during may partially offsetting these decreases was a higher weighted average tariff in operating expenses  environmental expenses and environmental reimbursements combined were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was the result of a decrease in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily due to lower environmental and maintenance expenses and reduced power costs 
environmental costs were lower due to the indemnification from an affiliate of williams for environmental issues resulting from operations prior to our ownership of the pipeline 
maintenance expenses declined due to improved cost controls as a result of the implementation of improved operating practices 
reduced power costs resulted from lower volumes transported coupled with reduced power rates 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase in pipeline lease expenses  which represent tariffs paid on connecting pipelines to move a customer s product to its ultimate destination  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million  or  primarily due to the addition of the gibson marine facility and the little rock inland terminals and increased maintenance expenses resulting from timing of tank cleaning and inspections at the inland terminals  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily due to the purchase in the current year of right of way easements that have historically been leased and higher property taxes 
revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in a net margin of million in the net margin represents a decrease of million compared to a net margin in of million resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the margin decline in reflects our agreement with an affiliate of williams to provide blending services for them for an annual fee rather than generating a commodity margin in relation to this activity from april through december affiliate management fee revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  historically  the petroleum products pipeline system received a fee to manage an affiliate pipeline 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  representing a million decrease from at million 
additional depreciation associated with acquisitions and capital improvements was more than offset by the elimination of depreciation associated with assets that previously were a part of magellan pipeline but were excluded from the assets transferred to us when we acquired the petroleum products pipeline system 
g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
prior to our acquisition of the petroleum products pipeline system  this operating unit was allocated g a costs from williams based on a multi factor formula 
following the acquisition  g a expenses that we paid to williams for this pipeline system were subject to an expense limitation  which resulted in a lower g a costs to us 
incentive compensation costs associated with our long term incentive plan were specifically excluded from the expense limitation and were million during and million during the incentive compensation costs included million associated with the early vesting of the restricted units issued to key employees at the time of our initial public offering 
the early vesting was triggered as a result of meeting targets for our growth in cash distributions paid to unitholders 
net interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily related to the debt financing of the petroleum products pipeline system 
although the weighted average interest rates decreased from in to in  the weighted average debt outstanding increased from million in to million in we do not pay income taxes because we are a partnership 
however  earnings from the petroleum products pipeline system were subject to income taxes prior to our acquisition of it in april  and our pre initial public offering earnings in were also taxable 
taxes on these earnings were at income tax rates of and for the year ended december  and  respectively  based on the effective income tax rate for williams as a result of williams tax sharing arrangement with its subsidiaries 
the effective income tax rate exceeds the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the operating margin increased by million during the period  largely as a result of increased revenues and reduced operating expenses including environmental expenses net of reimbursements for the petroleum products pipeline system  earnings from the acquisitions of the little rock and gibson terminal facilities and increased utilization and rates at our gulf coast marine facilities 
depreciation expense and g a expenses decreased by million and million  respectively  while net interest expense increased by million 
debt placement fee amortization expense increased million primarily due to costs from debt financing associated with the petroleum products pipeline system acquisition 
other income increased million primarily due to a gain on the sale of assets during and an impairment charge recorded during related to the inactive refinery site at augusta  kansas  the assets and liabilities of which were not transferred to us as part of our acquisition of the petroleum products pipeline system 
income taxes decreased million due to our partnership structure 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures during  net cash provided by operating activities exceeded distributions paid and maintenance capital requirements by million 
our cash distributions exceeded the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit by million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for and million for the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to reduced net income of million principally resulting from the one time costs related to the change in control of our general partner that impacted the current year  an increase in inventory of million during resulting from our july purchase of a petroleum products management operation 
the corresponding increase in accrued product purchases of million partially offset the inventory change  and non cash one time expenses associated with the change of control of our general partner in were generally offset by changes in our affiliate assets and liabilities 
the million increase in cash from operating activities from to was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
changes in operating assets and liabilities reduced net cash from operating activities by million and were principally attributable to an increase in accounts receivable and other accounts receivable of million 
as part of our acquisition of the petroleum products pipeline system in april  williams retained million of receivables resulting in a significant increase in receivables during as the receivables retained by williams were replaced in the ordinary course of business  a reduction in inventory of million due to the elimination of inventories associated with the petroleum products management operation retained by williams at the time of our acquisition of the petroleum products pipeline system  and net affiliate assets and liabilities increased million 
however  million of the increase was offset by related increases in environmental liabilities indemnified by affiliates 
the remaining increase of million was due primarily to establishing affiliate receivables for environmental liabilities indemnified at the time of our acquisition of the petroleum products pipeline system 
net cash used by investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
during  we acquired our petroleum products management operation 
during  we acquired our petroleum products pipeline system and the aux sable natural gas liquids pipeline 
during  we acquired our two little rock inland terminals and the gibson marine facility 
we also invested capital to maintain our existing assets 
total maintenance capital spending before reimbursements was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
please see capital requirements below for further discussion of capital expenditures as well as maintenance capital amounts net of reimbursements 
net cash provided used by financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash was used during primarily to pay cash distributions to our unitholders 
cash provided during principally included the debt and equity funding that were completed in conjunction with our acquisition of the petroleum products pipeline system 
cash was used in to repay affiliate notes associated with the assets held at the time of our initial public offering assets as well as payments made by our petroleum products pipeline system to decrease its affiliate note balance  partially offset by proceeds from debt borrowings and equity issued in our initial public offering and subsequent debt borrowings for acquisitions 
during  we paid million in cash distributions to our unitholders 
the quarterly distribution amount associated with the fourth quarter of was cents per unit 
if we continue to pay cash distributions at this current level and the number of outstanding units remains the same  total cash distributions of million will be paid to our unitholders annually 
of this amount  million  or  is related to our general partner s ownership interest and incentive distribution rights 
capital requirements the transportation  storage and distribution business requires continual investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations 
the capital requirements of our businesses consist primarily of maintenance capital expenditures  such as those required to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental regulations  and payout capital expenditures to acquire additional complementary assets to grow our business and to expand or upgrade our existing facilities  such as projects that increase storage or throughput volumes or develop pipeline connections to new supply sources 
williams agreed to reimburse us for maintenance capital expenditures incurred in and in excess of million per year related to the assets held at the time of our initial public offering 
this reimbursement obligation was subject to a maximum combined reimbursement for both years of million 
during and  we recorded reimbursements from williams associated with these assets of million and million  respectively 
in connection with our acquisition of magellan pipeline  williams agreed to reimburse us for maintenance capital expenditures incurred in  and in excess of million per year related to this pipeline system  subject to a maximum combined reimbursement for all years of million 
our maintenance capital expenditures related to the petroleum products pipeline system for and were less than million per year and we expect that they will be less than million in therefore  we do not anticipate reimbursement by williams associated with this agreement 
during  our maintenance capital spending net of environmental reimbursements was million 
reimbursable environmental projects were million during further  we spent an additional million of capital associated with our separation from williams  or million net of reimbursements 
we expect to incur maintenance capital expenditures for for all of our businesses of approximately million  net of reimbursable environmental projects 
in addition to maintenance capital expenditures  we also incur payout capital expenditures at our existing facilities for expansion and upgrade opportunities 
during  we spent million of payout capital  including acquisitions 
based on projects currently in process  we plan to spend approximately million of payout capital in on organic growth projects 
this amount does not include capital expenditures made in connection with future acquisitions 
we expect to fund our payout capital expenditures  including any acquisitions  from cash provided by operations  borrowings under the revolving credit facility discussed below and other borrowings  and the issuance of additional common units 
if capital markets do not permit us to issue additional debt and equity  our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to acquire additional assets and businesses 
liquidity magellan pipeline formerly williams pipe line senior secured notes 
in connection with the long term financing of our acquisition of the petroleum products pipeline system  we and our subsidiary  magellan pipeline  entered into a note purchase agreement on october  we made two borrowings under this agreement 
the first borrowing for million in november was used to repay a short term loan and related debt placement fees 
the second borrowing for million in december was used primarily to repay the outstanding acquisition sub facility of the olp term loan and credit facility described below 
the borrowings included series a and series b notes 
the maturity date of these notes is october   with scheduled prepayments equal to of the outstanding balance due on both october  and october  the debt is secured by our membership interests in and the assets of magellan pipeline 
payment of interest and principal is guaranteed by the partnership 
the series a notes include million of borrowings that incur interest based on the six month eurodollar rate plus 
the series b notes include million of borrowings that incur interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
in the event of a change in control of our general partner  each holder of the notes has days within which it could exercise a right to put its notes to magellan pipeline unless the new owner of our general partner has i a net worth of at least million and ii long term unsecured debt rated as investment grade by both moody s investor service inc and standard poor s rating service 
for these notes  a change in control is defined as the acquisition by any person of or more of the interest in our general partner 
the holders of these notes waived their put rights with respect to the change in control of our general partner 
the note purchase agreement contains various operational and financial covenants that restrict our ability to borrow additional funds 
the most significant of these is a leverage ratio that limits our debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the note purchase agreement  to to we are in compliance with all of these covenants 
magellan midstream partners term loan and revolving credit facility 
on august   we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
this facility  which replaced the olp term loan and revolving credit facility discussed below  is initially comprised of a million term loan and an million revolving credit facility 
up to million of the revolving credit commitments are available for letters of credit 
as of december   the million term loan was outstanding with million of the million revolving credit facility utilized for a letter of credit and the balance available for future borrowings 
the term loan portion of this borrowing was assigned a credit rating by the two largest rating agencies in the united states 
standard poor s rating service rated us bbb  and moody s investor service inc rated us ba indebtedness under the term loan initially incurred interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin of  while indebtedness under the revolving credit facility incurred interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin of 
however  effective december   we amended the credit facility resulting in a lower margin spread 
the new rate is the eurodollar rate plus 
we also incur a commitment fee on the un drawn portion of the revolving credit facility 
the facility provides for the establishment of up to million in additional term loans  which would bear interest at a rate agreed to at the time of borrowing 
the term loan matures on august   with scheduled prepayments equal to of the initial term loan balance due on august of each year until maturity 
the revolving credit facility terminates on august  obligations under the facility are secured by our partnership interests in the entities which hold our petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline system 
those entities are also guarantors of our obligations under the facility 
magellan pipeline is a separate operating subsidiary of ours and is not a guarantor under this facility 
under the terms of this facility  a change in control will result in an event of default  in which case the maturity date of the obligations under the facility may be accelerated 
for this facility  a change in control is defined in a variety of ways  each of which involve the current owners of mmh no longer maintaining majority control of the management of us  mmh or our general partner 
the note purchase agreement contains various operational and financial covenants that restrict our ability to borrow additional funds 
the most significant of these is a leverage ratio that limits our debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  to to we are in compliance with all of these covenants 
olp term loan and revolving credit facility 
subsequent to the closing of our initial public offering on february   we relied on cash generated from operations as our primary source of funding  except for payout capital expenditures 
additional funding requirements were met by a million credit facility of williams olp  lp which was renamed magellan olp  lp effective september   parent to our petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline system 
this credit facility was comprised of a million term loan and an million revolving credit facility 
this facility  which was due to mature on february   had the million term loan outstanding when it was repaid in full on august  with the proceeds from borrowings under the term loan of the credit facility described above 
debt to total capitalization the ratio of debt to total capitalization is a measure frequently used by the financial community to assess the reasonableness of a company s debt levels compared to its total capitalization  which is calculated by adding total debt and total partners capital 
based on the figures shown in our balance sheet  debt to total capitalization is at december  because accounting rules required the acquisition of our petroleum products pipeline system to be recorded at historical book value due to the affiliate nature of the transaction  the million difference between the purchase price and book value at the time of the acquisition was recorded as a decrease to our general partner s capital account  thus lowering our overall partners capital by that amount 
if this pipeline system had been acquired from a third party at the identical purchase price  the asset would have been recorded at market value  resulting in a debt to total capitalization of 
this pro forma debt to total capitalization ratio is presented in order to provide our investors with an understanding of what our debt to total capitalization position would have been had we made a similar acquisition from a third party entity 
we believe this presentation is important in comparing our debt to total capitalization ratio to that of other entities 
off balance sheet arrangements none contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of december  in millions total year years years years long term and current debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments affiliate operating and g a capital projects petroleum product purchases other we have an agreement with mmh  an affiliate entity  for operating and g a costs associated with our activities 
the agreement requires us to pay for actual operating costs incurred by mmh on our behalf and for g a costs incurred on our behalf up to the expense limitations as imposed by the new omnibus agreement 
the agreement  which began on june   has a five year term but has provisions for termination upon day notice by either party 
as a result of the termination provision and the agreements requirement to pay only mmh s costs as they are incurred  we are unable to determine the actual amount of this commitment 
environmental our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations  adopted by various governmental authorities  in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
we have accrued liabilities for estimated site restoration costs to be incurred in the future at our facilities and properties 
under our accounting policies  liabilities are recorded when site restoration and environmental remediation and cleanup obligations are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
williams  certain of its affiliates and mmh will indemnify us against certain environmental liabilities 
williams has guaranteed the obligations of its affiliates 
the terms and limitations of these indemnification agreements are summarized below 
for assets transferred to us from williams at the time of our initial public offering in february  williams agreed to indemnify us for up to million for environmental liabilities that exceed the amounts covered by the indemnities we received from the sellers of those assets 
we refer to this indemnity in the table below as the ipo indemnity 
the indemnity applies to environmental liabilities arising from conduct prior to the closing of the initial public offering february  and discovered within three years of closing of the initial public offering  however  the discovery period has been extended to august  in connection with our april acquisition of magellan pipeline  which owns our petroleum products pipeline  williams has agreed to indemnify us for losses and damages related to breaches of representations and warranties  including environmental representations and warranties and the violation or liabilities arising under any environmental laws prior to the acquisition 
this indemnity covers losses in excess of million up to a maximum of million 
we refer to this indemnity in the table below as the magellan pipeline indemnity 
claims related to this environmental indemnity must be made prior to april and must be related to events that occurred prior to april  in addition to these two agreements  the purchase and sale agreement june psa entered into in connection with mmh s acquisition of us provides us with two additional indemnities related to environmental liabilities  which we cumulatively refer to as the acquisition indemnity in the table below 
first  mmh the buyer under the june psa assumed williams obligations to indemnify us for million of known environmental liabilities  of which million was associated with known liabilities at magellan pipeline facilities  million was associated with known liabilities at our petroleum products terminal facilities and million was associated with known liabilities on the ammonia pipeline system 
second  in the june psa  williams agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities arising prior to june  related to all of our facilities to the extent not already indemnified under williams two preexisting indemnification obligations described above 
this additional indemnification includes those liabilities related to our petroleum products terminals and the ammonia pipeline system arising after the initial public offering february  through june  and those liabilities related to magellan pipeline arising after our acquisition of it on april  through june  this indemnification covers environmental as well as other liabilities and is capped at million 
a summary of the indemnities we have with williams  total claims against those indemnities and the amount of those indemnities remaining is provided below

critical accounting estimates goodwill impairment in january  we began applying the rules promulgated by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  relative to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard we no longer amortize goodwill because it is an asset with an indefinite useful life but test it for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test is to determine if the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the goodwill may be impaired 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill should be calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination 
goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheet was million at december  and million at both december  and the change in goodwill during was the result of a purchase price adjustment created by a contingency payment associated with the acquisition of our little rock  arkansas terminal 
all of the goodwill and other intangibles recognized by us are associated with the petroleum products terminals segment and were acquired as part of the gibson  louisiana and little rock  arkansas terminals acquisitions 
we performed our annual testing of goodwill  as required by sfas no 
 as of october  we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate of our petroleum products terminals segment because significant judgment is exercised during the process of determining the petroleum products terminals segment fair value and because different assumptions could result in material charges to our operating results 
for the test  fair value of the petroleum products terminals was assessed using two approaches a discounted future cash flows approach  and an ebitda multiple approach 
the discounted future cash flows model assumed a discount rate based on an expected return on equity and a cost of debt and a debt to equity ratio 
under the ebitda multiple approach  we applied a multiple of times the adjusted ebitda of the petroleum products terminals segment to determine fair value 
we define ebitda as income before income taxes plus interest expense net of interest income  depreciation and amortization expense and debt placement fee amortization 
ebitda multiples are used industry wide in assessing values for business assets similar to those in our petroleum products terminals segment 
the ebitda of the petroleum products terminals segment was adjusted to exclude a portion of the general and administrative expenses to take into consideration expected synergies 
under both of the methodologies described above the fair value of the petroleum products terminals segment exceeded the carrying value of the segment 
therefore  we did not recognize an impairment in in reaching the conclusion above  more confidence was placed on the discounted cash flow model because management believes this approach provides a better assessment of the actual value that a willing buyer and willing seller could agree upon 
the critical factors in the discounted cash flow model are the required rate of return on equity and the cost of debt 
a chart showing the implied impairments under various assumed changes in the estimates is provided below in millions debt equity ratio debt cost equity cost implied impairment based on the table one can determine that  assuming all other factors remain constant  if debt costs increased from our assumed rate of to  combined with an increase in our assumed required rate of return on equity from to  the assets of the petroleum products terminals segment would be impaired 
it is likely that under this scenario the entire million of goodwill would be impaired 
because we pay no income taxes  the impairment would reduce operating profit and net income by million  which represents a decrease in operating profit and a decrease in net income for assuming our current distribution levels for an entire year  this impairment would reduce both basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
our management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
environmental liabilities we estimate the liabilities associated with environmental expenditures based on site specific project plans for remediation  taking into account prior remediation experience 
experienced remediation project managers evaluate each known case of environmental liability to determine what phases and associated costs can be reasonably estimated and to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and or state requirements 
we believe the accounting estimate relative to environmental remediation costs to be a critical accounting estimate because estimated expenditures  which will generally be made over the next to years  are subject to cost fluctuations and could change materially  unanticipated third party liabilities may arise  and changes in federal  state and local environmental regulations could also significantly increase the amount of the liability 
the estimate for environmental liabilities is a critical accounting estimate for all three of our operating segments 
a defined process for project reviews is integrated into our system integrity plan 
specifically  our remediation project managers meet once a year with accounting  operations  legal and other personnel to evaluate  in detail  the known environmental liabilities associated with each of our operating units 
the purpose of the annual project review is to assess all aspects of each project  evaluating what will be required to achieve regulatory compliance  estimating the costs associated with executing the regulatory phases that can be reasonably estimated and estimating the timing for those expenditures 
during the site specific evaluations  all known information is utilized in conjunction with professional judgment and experience to determine the appropriate approach to remediation and to assess liabilities 
the general remediation process to achieve regulatory compliance consists of site investigation delineation  site remediation  and long term monitoring 
each of these phases can  and often does  include unknown variables that complicate the task of evaluating the estimated costs to complete 
each quarter  we reevaluate our environmental estimates taking into account any new incidents that have occurred since the last annual meeting of the remediation project managers  any changes in the site situation and additional findings and or changes in federal or state regulations 
the estimated environmental liability accruals are adjusted as necessary 
at december   our environmental liabilities were million 
during  we spent million for environmental remediation but also made significant accrual adjustments to six environmental projects 
these adjustments resulted in an increase in our environmental liabilities of million 
accruals for all other projects  including five new projects identified during the year  were million  resulting in the december  environmental liability of million 
the million increase in our environmental liabilities during was the result of additional work and reassessments at the six previously mentioned terminals on our petroleum products pipeline system 
williams indemnified these liabilities  consequently  there was no impact to our operating profit or net income from these accrual increases 
during  we spent million for environmental remediation 
during  we experienced a leak on our petroleum products pipeline near kansas city  kansas  which resulted in an increase to our environmental liabilities of million 
insurance proceeds are expected to cover million of these costs and the remaining million was charged against our income in the recommendations that came from the annual and quarterly review process during resulted in our increasing the environmental liabilities associated with over separate remediation sites by approximately million 
these accrual increases did not have a significant impact our operating profit or net income because williams indemnified most of the increases 
our environmental liabilities at december  were million 
based on the assumption of an additional increase in our estimated environmental liabilities and further assuming that none of those additional liabilities would be indemnified  our expenses would increase by million 
because we pay no income taxes  operating profit and net income would decrease by the same amount  which represents a decrease of of our operating profit and of our net income for assuming our current distribution levels for the entire year  this additional expense would reduce both basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
such a change would result in less than a increase in both our total liabilities and total equity 
the impact of such an increase in environmental costs would likely not have affected our liquidity because  even with the increased costs  we would still comply with the covenants of our long term debt agreements as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
our management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
environmental receivables as described above  we have agreements which indemnify us against certain environmental liabilities  the most significant of which are with williams and mmh 
when a site specific environmental liability is recognized  a determination is made as to whether or not the liability is indemnified 
if so  a receivable for the amount of the indemnified liability is also recognized 
we do not require payment from the indemnifying party until actual remediation work is performed on the site 
at that time  the indemnifying party is billed for the remediation work and the cash received is used to reduce the environmental receivable 
changes in our environmental receivables since december  are as follows in millions indemnifying party balance balance balance accruals payments accruals transfers payments williams mmh other totals we believe that the accounting estimate related to affiliate receivables is a critical accounting estimate because its carrying amount is subject to many of the same estimates as those used to develop the underlying environmental liabilities see critical accounting estimates environmental liabilities above  and given williams unfavorable financial status in recent years  it requires our management s estimations involving williams ability to pay and our ability to collect the receivable amount 
should williams be unable to perform on its existing obligations  we may be unable to collect part or all of this environmental account receivable 
in preparing our financial statements for the year ended december   management s assumptions were that we would be able to collect the full amount of this receivable from williams 
any change in our estimate of the amount of the receivable we believe we can ultimately collect from williams would require us to take a charge against income because we have not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts associated with this receivable 
if none of the receivable were collectable  we would have a charge against income of million  which represents of our operating profit and of our net income for assuming our current distribution levels for the entire year  this additional expense would reduce both basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
the impact of such a charge would likely not have affected our liquidity because  even with the increased expense  we would still comply with the covenants of our long term debt agreements as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
our management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this revision requires that companies provide more details about their plan assets  benefit obligations  cash flows  benefit costs and other relevant information 
a description of investment policies and strategies and target allocation percentages  or target ranges  for these asset categories also are required in financial statements 
cash flows will include projections of future benefit payments and an estimate of contributions to be made in the next year to fund pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in addition to expanded annual disclosures  the fasb is requiring companies to report the various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after december   and for quarters beginning after december in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon its initial adoption 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  in addition all provisions of this statement must be applied prospectively 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the initial application of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement improves the prominence and clarity of the pro forma disclosures required by statement by prescribing a specific tabular format and by requiring disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies or its equivalent 
the standard is effective for fiscal periods ending after december  although we account for stock based compensation for williams employees assigned to the partnership under provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 the structure of the awards is such that we fully recognize compensation expense associated with unit awards 
hence  had we adopted this standard  it would not have had a material impact on our operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we adopted this standard in january and it did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in the second quarter of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no

finally  the amendments to sfas no 
accounting for leases are effective for transactions occurring after may  all other provisions of this statement will be effective for financial statements issued on or after may  we adopted this standard in january  and it did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
however  in subsequent reporting periods  any gains and losses from debt extinguishments will not be accounted for as extraordinary items 
related party transactions affiliate revenues historically represented revenues from williams and its affiliates 
subsequent to williams sale of its interests in us on june   we no longer have affiliate revenues 
affiliate revenues have declined significantly over the past three years  however  total revenues have increased 
amounts are summarized in the table below in millions affiliate revenues total revenues affiliate revenues as a percent of total revenue we had agreements with williams energy marketing trading  llc wem t which provided for i the lease of a carthage  missouri propane storage cavern and ii access and utilization of storage on the magellan pipeline system 
magellan pipeline had entered into pipeline lease agreements and tank storage agreements with mid america pipeline company mapl and williams bio energy  llc williams bio energy  respectively 
mapl was an affiliate entity until its sale by williams in july and williams bio energy was an affiliate entity until its sale by williams in may the partnership also had a lease storage contract with williams bio energy at its galena park  texas marine terminal facility 
we also had an agreement with wem t  which provided for storage and other ancillary services at our marine terminal facilities 
this agreement was cancelled during the first quarter of in exchange for a million payment to us from wem t 
both wem t and williams refining marketing had agreements for the access and utilization of the inland terminals 
in addition  we had an agreement with williams petroleum services  llc to perform services related to petroleum product asset management activities for an annual fee in of approximately million 
in july  we acquired from williams and its affiliates the rights to these activities 
we also had affiliate agreements with wem t and williams refining marketing  llc for the non exclusive and non transferable sub license to use the atlas software system 
the rights to this system were contributed to us on june  the following table reflects revenues from various williams subsidiaries through june  in thousands year ended december  williams owned affiliates williams energy marketing trading williams refining marketing williams bio energy midstream marketing risk management mid america pipeline williams petroleum services  llc other williams partially owned affiliates longhorn pipeline partners rio grande pipeline total costs and expenses related to activities between williams and its affiliates and us after june   have been accounted for as unaffiliated third party transactions 
transactions between the partnership and mmh and its affiliates were accounted for as affiliate transactions after june  the following table summarizes costs and expenses from various affiliate companies with us and are reflected in the cost and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in thousands year ended december  williams energy services direct and directly allocable expenses williams allocated general and administrative expenses williams allocated operating and maintenance expenses williams energy marketing trading product purchases mid america pipeline operating and maintenance expenses mmh allocated operating and maintenance expenses mmh allocated general and administrative expenses in  and for the period january  through june   williams allocated both direct and indirect general and administrative expenses to our general partner 
direct expenses allocated by williams were primarily salaries and benefits of employees and officers associated with the business activities of the affiliate 
indirect expenses include legal  accounting  treasury  engineering  information technology and other corporate services 
williams allocated these expenses to our general partner based on the expense limitation provided for in the omnibus agreement 
we reimbursed our general partner and its affiliates for expenses charged to us by our general partner on a monthly basis 
as a result  of the sale of williams ownership interests in us  we entered into a new services agreement with mmh pursuant to which mmh agreed to perform specified services required for our operation 
consequently  our operations and general and administrative functions are now provided by mmh 
our reimbursement of general and administrative costs is subject to the limitations as defined in the new omnibus agreement 
in addition  in  and for the period january  through june   williams allocated operating and maintenance expenses to the partnership s general partner 
expenses included all costs directly associated with the operations of the partnership s businesses 
from june  through december  operating expenses were allocated to the partnership s general partner from mmh 
beginning with the closing date of the initial public offering  our general partner  through provisions included in the omnibus agreement  agreed that for the assets associated with the petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline system operations  we would reimburse our general partner for general and administrative costs up to a specified expense limitation 
in addition  beginning with the acquisition of magellan pipeline  our general partner agreed that for these assets  we would reimburse our general partner for general and administrative costs up to a specified expense limitation 
mapl and we had an operating agreement whereby mapl operated the ammonia pipeline system for us for a fee 
on july   williams sold of mapletree llc  which owned mapl  to enterprise products partners lp enterprise 
all transactions between us  mapl and enterprise after july  have been recorded as unaffiliated third party transactions 
historically  magellan pipeline had an agreement with wem t to purchase transmix for fractionation and product to settle shortages 
for the periods that mapl was an affiliate of the partnership  mapl provided operating and maintenance support  to the ammonia pipeline and leased storage space to magellan pipeline 
williams and certain of its affiliates and mmh have indemnified us against certain environmental costs 
receivables from williams or its affiliates associated with these environmental costs were million and million at december  and december   respectively  and are included with accounts receivable amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets 
receivables from mmh were million at december  and are included with the affiliate accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
a description of williams and mmh s indemnities to us is included in the environmental section above 
historically  williams charged interest expense to its affiliates based on their inter company debt balances 
we also participated in employee benefit plans and long term incentive plans sponsored by williams 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this annual report on form k include forward looking statements statements that discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations 
we make these forward looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates  believes  expects  estimates  forecasts  projects and other similar expressions 
although we believe our forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  statements made regarding future results are subject to numerous assumptions  uncertainties and risks that may cause future results to be materially different from the results stated or implied in this document 
the following are among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted price trends and overall demand for natural gas liquids  refined petroleum products  natural gas  oil and ammonia in the united states  weather patterns materially different than historical trends  development of alternative energy sources  changes in demand for storage in our petroleum products terminals  changes in supply patterns for our marine terminals due to geopolitical events  changes in our tariff rates implemented by the ferc and the surface transportation board  shut downs or cutbacks at major refineries  petrochemical plants  ammonia production facilities or other businesses that use or supply our services  changes in throughput on petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by third parties and connected to our petroleum products terminals or petroleum products pipeline system  loss of one or more of our three customers on our ammonia pipeline system  changes in the federal government s policy regarding farm subsidies  which could negatively impact the demand for ammonia and reduce the amount of ammonia transported through our ammonia pipeline system  an increase in the competition our operations encounter  the occurrence of an operational hazard or unforeseen interruption for which we are not adequately insured  our ability to integrate any acquired operations into our existing operations  our ability to successfully identify and close strategic acquisitions and expansion projects and make cost saving changes in operations  changes in general economic conditions in the united states  changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject  including tax and state tax withholding issues  safety  environmental and employment laws and regulations  the cost and effects of legal and administrative claims and proceedings against us or our subsidiaries  the amount of our indebtedness  which could make us vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  place us at competitive disadvantages compared to our competitors that have less debt or have other adverse consequences  the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in the united states  the ability to raise capital in a cost effective way  the effect of changes in accounting policies  the ability to manage rapid growth  williams and mmh s ability to perform on their environmental and rights of way indemnifications to us  supply disruption  and global and domestic economic repercussions from terrorist activities and the government s response thereto 
risks related to our business we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to allow us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the cash we generate from our operations 
because the cash we generate from operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  we may not be able to pay the minimum quarterly distribution for each quarter 
our ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution each quarter depends primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net income 
potential future acquisitions and expansions  if any  may affect our business by substantially increasing the level of our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and increasing our risk of being unable to effectively integrate these new operations 
from time to time  we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and businesses 
acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness 
if we consummate any future acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly 
acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses  inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with them and new geographic areas and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
further  unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined  and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition 
following an acquisition  we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions 
our financial results depend on the demand for the petroleum products that we transport  store and distribute 
any sustained decrease in demand for petroleum products in the markets served by our pipeline and terminals could result in a significant reduction in the volume of products that we transport in our pipeline  store at our marine terminal facilities and distribute through our inland terminals  and thereby reduce our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions 
factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include an increase in the market price of crude oil that leads to higher refined products prices  which may reduce demand for gasoline and other petroleum products 
market prices for refined petroleum products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in global and regional supply over which we have no control  a recession or other adverse economic condition that results in lower spending by consumers and businesses on transportation fuels such as gasoline  jet fuel and diesel  higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase the cost of gasoline  an increase in fuel economy  whether as a result of a shift by consumers to more fuel efficient vehicles or technological advances by manufacturers  and the increased use of alternative fuel sources  such as fuel cells and solar  electric and battery powered engines 
several state and federal initiatives mandate this increased use 
when prices for the future delivery of petroleum products that we transport through our pipeline system or store in our marine terminals fall below current prices  customers are less likely to store these products  thereby reducing our storage revenues 
this market condition is commonly referred to as backwardation 
when the petroleum products market is in backwardation  the demand for storage capacity at our facilities may decrease 
if the market becomes strongly backwardated for an extended period of time  it may affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
we depend on petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by others to supply our terminals 
most of our inland and marine terminal facilities  which are not connected to our petroleum products pipeline system  depend on connections with petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by third parties 
reduced throughput on these pipelines because of testing  line repair  damage to pipelines  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in our being unable to deliver products to our customers from our terminals or receive products for storage and could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scale 
since the september attacks  the us government has issued warnings that energy assets  specifically our nation s pipeline infrastructure  may be future targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
any future terrorist attack on our facilities  those of our customers and  in some cases  those of other pipelines  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the transportation and distribution of refined petroleum products and ammonia  including ruptures  leaks and fires 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of our related operations 
we are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business 
in addition  as a result of market conditions  premiums for our insurance policies have increased significantly and could escalate further 
in some instances  insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist and sabotage acts 
if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured  it could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
rate regulation or a successful challenge to the rates we charge on our petroleum products pipeline system may reduce the amount of cash we generate 
the ferc regulates the tariff rates for our petroleum products system 
shippers may protest the pipeline s tariffs  and the ferc may investigate the lawfulness of new or changed tariff rates and order refunds of amounts collected under rates ultimately found to be unlawful 
the ferc may also investigate tariff rates that have become final and effective 
the ferc s ratemaking methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our true costs or may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs 
the ferc s primary ratemaking methodology is price indexing 
we use this methodology to establish our rates in approximately one third of our interstate markets 
the indexing method allows a pipeline to increase its rates by a percentage equal to the change in the producer price index  or ppi 
please read narrative description of business tariff regulation for further discussion of tariff rates and how they have been impacted by the ppi 
if the ppi falls  we could be required to reduce our rates that are based on the ferc s price indexing methodology if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate 
in addition  changes in the ppi might not be large enough to fully reflect actual increases in the costs associated with operating the pipeline 
in recent decisions involving unrelated partnerships that own pipelines  the ferc has ruled that these partnerships may not claim an income tax allowance for income attributable to non corporate limited partners 
a shipper could rely on these decisions to challenge our indexed rates and claim that  because we now own a petroleum products pipeline system  the pipeline system s income tax allowance should be reduced 
if the ferc were to disallow all or part of our income tax allowance  it may be more difficult to justify our rates 
if a challenge were brought and the ferc found that some of the indexed rates exceed levels justified by the cost of service  the ferc would order a reduction in the indexed rates and could require reparations for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 
we establish rates in approximately two thirds of our markets using the ferc s market based rate making regulations 
these regulations allow us to establish rates based on conditions in individual markets without regard to the index or our costs of service 
if successfully challenged  the ferc could take away our ability to establish market based rates 
any reduction in the indexed rates  removal or our ability to establish market based rates  or payment of reparations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
mergers among our customers and competitors could result in lower volumes being shipped on our pipelines and or products stored in or distributed through our terminals  thereby reducing the amount of cash we generate 
mergers between existing customers could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to utilize their existing systems instead of ours in those markets where the systems compete 
as a result  we could lose some or all of the volumes and associated revenues from these customers and we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes and revenues 
because most of our operating costs are fixed  a reduction in volumes would result not only in less revenues  but also a decline in net income and cash flow of a similar magnitude  which would reduce our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
the closure of mid continent refineries that supply the petroleum products pipeline system could result in disruptions or reductions in the volumes transported on our petroleum products pipeline and the amount of cash we generate 
the us environmental protection agency recently adopted requirements that require refineries to install equipment to lower the sulfur content of gasoline and some diesel fuel they produce 
the requirements relating to gasoline took effect and will be implemented in  and the requirements relating to diesel fuel will take effect in and be implemented through if refinery owners that use our petroleum pipeline system determine that compliance with these new requirements is too costly  they may close some of these refineries  which could reduce the volumes transported on our petroleum products pipeline and the amount of cash we generate 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that govern the environmental and operational safety aspects of our operations 
each of our operating segments is subject to the risk of incurring substantial costs and liabilities under environmental and safety laws 
these costs and liabilities arise under increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  including regulations and governmental enforcement policies  and as a result of claims for damages to property or persons arising from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and  to a lesser extent  issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 
if we were unable to recover these costs through increased revenues  our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions could be adversely affected 
the terminal and pipeline facilities that comprise the petroleum products pipeline system have been used for many years to transport  distribute or store petroleum products 
over time  operations by us  our predecessors or third parties may have resulted in the disposal or release of hydrocarbons or solid wastes at or from these terminal properties and along such pipeline rights of way 
in addition  some of our terminals and pipelines are located on or near current or former refining and terminal sites  and there is a risk that contamination is present on those sites 
we may be held jointly and severally liable under a number of these environmental laws and regulations for such disposal and releases of hydrocarbons or solid wastes or the existence of contamination  even in circumstances where such activities or conditions were caused by third parties not under our control or were otherwise lawful at the time that they occurred 
in addition  we own a number of properties that have been used for many years to distribute or store petroleum products by third parties not under our control 
in some cases  owners  tenants or users of these properties have disposed of or released hydrocarbons or solid wastes on or under these properties 
in addition  some of our terminals are located on or near current or former refining and terminal operations  and there is a risk that contamination is present on these sites 
the transportation of ammonia by our pipeline is hazardous and may result in environmental damage  including accidental releases that may cause death or injuries to humans and farm animals and damage to crops 
our business is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations that govern the product quality specifications of the petroleum products that we store and transport 
petroleum products that we store and transport are sold by our customers for consumption into the public market 
various federal  state  and local agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications to commodities sold into the public market 
changes in product quality specifications could reduce our throughput volume  require us to incur additional handling costs  or could require the expenditure of capital 
for instance  different product specifications for different markets impacts the fungibility of the system and could require the construction of additional storage 
if we are unable to recover these costs through increased revenues  our ability to meet our financial obligations could be adversely affected 
competition with respect to our operating segments could ultimately lead to lower levels of profits and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
we face competition from other pipelines and terminals in the same markets as our petroleum products pipeline system  as well as from other means of transporting  storing and distributing petroleum products 
in addition  our marine and inland terminals face competition from large  generally well financed companies that own many terminals  as well as from small companies 
our marine and inland terminals also encounter competition from integrated refining and marketing companies that own their own terminal facilities 
our customers demand delivery of products on tight time schedules and in a number of geographic markets 
if our quality of service declines or we cannot meet the demands of our customers  they may use our competitors 
we compete primarily with rail carriers for the transportation of ammonia 
if our customers elect to transport ammonia by rail rather than pipeline  we may realize lower revenues and cash flows and our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions may be adversely affected 
our ammonia pipeline also competes with another ammonia pipeline in iowa and nebraska 
our ammonia pipeline system is dependent on three customers 
three customers ship all of the ammonia on our pipeline and utilize the six terminals that we own and operate on the pipeline 
we have contracts with these three shippers through june that obligate them to ship or pay for specified minimum quantities of ammonia 
one of these customers has a credit rating below investment grade 
the loss of any one of these three customers or their failure or inability to pay us could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
high natural gas prices can increase ammonia production costs and reduce the amount of ammonia transported through our ammonia pipeline system 
the profitability of our customers that produce ammonia partially depends on the price of natural gas  which is the principal raw material used in the production of ammonia 
natural gas prices increased late in the fourth quarter of and have remained high throughout an extended period of high natural gas prices may cause our customers to produce and ship lower volumes of ammonia  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
williams sold its interests in our general partner in as a result of the sale  mmh  the entity that purchased williams interest  entered into a new omnibus agreement with williams and certain of its affiliates to provide general and administrative services to us  which will result in higher general and administrative expenses and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
in connection with the sale to mmh by williams of of its ownership interests in our general partner and all of its limited partner interests in us  we are a third party beneficiary of a new omnibus agreement with mmh 
there are limitations through on the amount of general and administrative expenses for which we are required to reimburse mmh and certain of its affiliates  which operate as follows for expenses below a lower cap amount  mmh and its affiliates are not required to make any reimbursements to us  for expenses above the lower cap amount and below an upper cap amount  mmh or its affiliates are required to reimburse us  and for expenses above the upper cap amount  mmh and its affiliates are not required to make any reimbursements to us  although williams will reimburse mmh for these amounts through june the initial lower cap amount for was approximately million  but escalates annually beginning in  at or  if greater  the percentage increase in the consumer price index  which is a higher escalation rate than was in effect prior to williams sale of its interests in us 
the upper cap amount was million for  and will escalate annually  beginning in at the lesser of or the percentage increase in the consumer price index 
the upper and lower caps will be further adjusted for incremental general and administrative costs associated with acquisitions we consummate 
these limitations on our obligation to reimburse mmh and certain of its affiliates for general and administrative expenses will terminate upon a change in control of mmh or our general partner 
a change in control of our general partner will be deemed to occur if  among other things  directors are elected whose nomination for election to our general partner s board of directors was not approved by our general partner or its board of directors or any nominating committee thereof at a time when the board was comprised of only such approved directors or the current directors 
in the event of a change in control  the amount of cash we generate will be reduced by any general and administrative costs we incur above the lower cap  resulting from the partnership becoming liable for the full amount of general and administrative costs 
the sale of williams interests in our general partner required us to separate from williams 
this in turn  required us to obtain services from other sources  which could result in increased costs and limit our ability to meet our obligations and pay cash distributions 
we have entered into a new services agreement with mmh and our general partner 
the services provided under the new services agreement include accounting  building administration  human resources  information technology  legal and security  among others 
as with our old services agreement  mmh will have the right at any time to terminate its obligations under this services agreement upon days notice 
to the extent that neither mmh nor any of its subsidiaries  including our general partner  provides these services to us  the limitations under the new omnibus agreement on our reimbursement of general and administrative expenses relating to these services would no longer apply and we may incur increased general and administrative expenses  which could increase our costs and limit our ability to meet our obligations and pay cash distributions 
indemnities provided by williams related to assets contributed at our initial public offering  our acquisition of magellan pipeline and williams sale of its interests in us creates credit exposure to williams 
williams and certain of its affiliates have indemnified us for certain liabilities and expenses related to the assets contributed to us at the time of our initial public offering  the contribution of magellan pipeline to us in april and the sale of of their interest in our general partner and all of its limited partner interest in us to mmh 
these indemnities primarily address environmental liabilities related to matters that arose prior to our ownership of these assets and in the case of the mmh transaction  prior to june williams has experienced financial and liquidity difficulties that resulted in the loss of its investment grade credit rating 
if williams were unable to perform on its indemnities it would increase our environmental costs and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
our secured indebtedness could limit our ability to raise cash to fund future obligations or liquidity concerns 
as of december   our total outstanding long term indebtedness was million  including million of senior secured notes and million under a credit facility 
the indebtedness represented by our senior secured notes and under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
covenants in our debt instruments restrict the aggregate amount of debt that we can borrow 
in addition  these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens  sell assets  make loans or investments  and to acquire or be acquired by other companies 
these debt instruments also provide that  if a change in control of mmh or our general partner occurs  this indebtedness may become due 
in such event  we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay this indebtedness 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would reduce the amount of cash we generate 
a partnership is not a taxable entity and incurs no federal income tax liability 
instead  each partner of a partnership is required to take into account his share of items of income  gain  loss and deduction of the partnership in computing his federal income tax liability 
the internal revenue code generally provides that a publicly traded partnership will be taxed as a corporation 
however  an exception  know as the qualifying income exception  exists with respect to publicly traded partnerships of which or more of the gross income for every taxable year consists of qualifying income 
qualifying income includes income derived from the transportation  storage and processing of crude oil  natural gas and products thereof and fertilizer 
if we fail to meet the qualifying income exception  we may be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
the after tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate rate 
some or all of the distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend incomes  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a material reduction in our anticipated cash flow due to federal and state taxes  which would reduce our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation even though they are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available to pay distributions would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or an existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be decreased to reflect that impact on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we were not engaged in interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate hedging transactions 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
debt we incur under our credit facility and our floating rate series a senior secured notes bear variable interest based on the eurodollar rate 
if the eurodollar changed by  our annual interest obligations associated with the million of outstanding borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility at december   and the million of outstanding borrowings under the floating rate series a senior secured notes would change by approximately million 
unless interest rates change significantly in the future  our exposure to interest rate market risk is minimal
