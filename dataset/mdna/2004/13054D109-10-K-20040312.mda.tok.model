item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of march   we own  license or franchise restaurants in states  the district of columbia and five foreign countries  of which are company owned and operate under the names california pizza kitchen and california pizza kitchen asap  the remaining operate under franchise or license arrangements 
during our years of operating history  we believe we have developed strong brand awareness and demonstrated the appeal of our concept in a wide variety of geographic areas 
our concept was  and remains  to take our customers favorite food cravings and put them on a pizza to figuratively put the world on a pizza 
we opened our first casual dining restaurant in in beverly hills  california and grew steadily to restaurants by early our concept  with its signature line of innovative  premium pizzas  open flame ovens in exhibition style kitchens and excellent guest service  attracted pepsico  inc hereafter referred to as pepsico  which bought a controlling interest in our company in may during the approximately five year period when pepsico was our controlling shareholder  we opened restaurants  of which were subsequently closed 
we experimented with different locations and different restaurant sizes  ranging from  square feet to more than  square feet 
our rapid expansion strained our infrastructure  resulted in a variety of management and operational changes  diverted our attention from the execution of our concept and led to disappointing operating results and financial performance  including a decline in comparable restaurant sales in at the end of  pepsico concluded that it would sell or otherwise divest all of its restaurant businesses  including california pizza kitchen 
in september  we consummated a series of transactions to effect a merger and leveraged recapitalization through which an investor group led by bruckmann  rosser  sherrill co  lp acquired pepsico s interest in our company 
since the beginning of  we have instituted an accelerated growth plan  focusing largely on further penetrating our existing markets 
between january and december  we opened new company owned  full service restaurants and three asap restaurants 
in july  richard rosenfield and larry flax  co founders and co chairmen of the board  reassumed the responsibilities of co chief executive officers 
in connection with this management change  we reviewed our restaurant portfolio  as well as our operations and growth strategy  and decided to slow down our new restaurant opening schedule to a range of to new units  emphasizing quality and profitability 
we plan to open a new restaurant prototype in  which is larger than our former prototype and has been designed to encourage a more adult experience and increase alcohol sales 
these new restaurants will require on average a higher net investment than our historical restaurants 
however  we expect corresponding sales to be higher and ultimately generate a higher restaurant cashflow 
pre opening expenses for each of these new restaurants is expected to average approximately  per restaurant 
our new restaurants experience higher cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for approximately their first to days of operations in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our mature restaurants 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new restaurant openings has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on pre opening expenses  cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs until our restaurant operating base is large enough to mitigate these opening costs and inefficiencies 
our revenues are comprised of restaurant sales  franchise royalties and other income 
our restaurant sales are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
our franchise royalties and other revenues consist primarily of monthly royalty income  initial franchise fees and license fees from our strategic alliance with kraft 

table of contents cost of sales is comprised of food  beverage and paper supply expenses

direct operating and occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant sales 
general and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and related employee benefits  travel and relocation costs  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial work force  travel  the cost of food used in training  marketing costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a new restaurant 
in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
as of december   we had full service company owned restaurants that met this criterion

potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors  changes in food costs  changes in labor costs  war and weather conditions 
in the past we have experienced significant variability in pre opening costs from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily a function of the timing of restaurant openings 
we typically incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a given restaurant in the month of opening 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and direct operating and occupancy costs associated with a newly opened restaurant during the first three to four months of operation are often materially greater than what will be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales 
accordingly  the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs 
as a result of our new site selection process and new prototype  our new restaurant openings are anticipated to open in the last two quarters of our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  we expect our highest earnings to occur in those periods 
as a result of all of these factors  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years we have funded our capital requirements primarily through cash flow from operations and proceeds from the initial public offering of our stock 
in  net cash flow provided by operating activities was million compared to million in and million in net cash flow provided by operating activities exceeded net income for primarily due to the effects of depreciation and amortization  loss on impairment of property and equipment and restaurant closures and the net changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities in was primarily due to an increase in our deferred tax asset and prepaid expenses and other assets resulting from prepaid rent  offset by an increase in accrued liabilities resulting from accrued payroll tax 
in both and net cash flow provided by operating 
table of contents activities exceeded the net income due to the effects of depreciation and amortization  loss on impairment of property and equipment and restaurant closures and changes in working capital 
we use cash to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodel our existing restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in we opened new restaurants in compared to in investment activities consisted of capital expenditures of million compared to million in  which was the result of million spent on new restaurants compared to million in and million spent on capitalized maintenance and remodels compared to million in additionally  we invested million of our cash equivalents into short term marketable securities during to maximize interest income 
we also invested million for a equity interest in a new restaurant concept called la food show  inc in march of net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and consisted of employee common stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december  we have a million revolving line of credit  of which nothing is currently outstanding 
the line of credit expires on june  and bears interest at either the bank base rate minus or libor plus 
availability under the credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit  which totaled million as of december  in addition  the credit facility includes financial and non financial covenants  with which the company was in full compliance as of december  and as of the date of this report 
our capital requirements  including costs related to opening additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
we anticipate total capital expenditures between million and million in with the majority of expenditure associated with the ten to new store openings previously stated 
other capital expenditure is expected to be consistant with prior year trends and will be primarily directed toward maintenance capital associated with existing and mature stores  remodels and planned information technology upgrades 
we expect to fund all capital requirements using operating cash flow 
additionally  we anticipate pre opening costs on average to be approximately  however  any unexpected delays in construction  labor shortages or other factors could result in higher than anticipated pre opening costs 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations and funds anticipated to be available from our credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short term and long term basis 
changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events may cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our on going business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated vie transactions 

table of contents contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of the leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum rent based on a percentage of sales and require expenses incidental to the use of the property

la food show reimburses us for all of the leased employees wages  benefits and other employee related costs  as well as all business related expenses incurred by the leased employees 
as of march  we have approximately a  receivable associated with the employee lease agreement 
one of our directors also serves as president and is sole owner of cah restaurants of california  llc 
we had entered into franchise and development agreements with cah restaurants of california  llc pursuant to which it operated two california pizza kitchen restaurants 
cah restaurants of california  llc paid franchise and royalty fees to us under these agreements 
we recorded an aggregate of  and  in such fees during the years ended and  respectively 
on december  we acquired the territory rights and assets used to operate two restaurants from cah restaurants of california for million 
these california restaurants  one asap and one full service are located in thousand oaks and ventura  respectively 
the transaction was executed with million cash with the balance of the purchase price paid in common stock 
cah restaurants of california  llc assigned its right to receive these shares to mr 
caruso 
as part of the acquisition  we assumed the leases for the two restaurants  on of which is entered into with westlake promenade  llc that is wholly owned by mr 
caruso 

table of contents for the nine weeks to february   we made aggregated lease payments to caruso affiliated holdings cah for two california store locations of  and  for thousand oaks and marina del rey  respectively

cah was the owner of record prior to the company s purchase of the thousand oaks store on december  and cah purchased marina waterside shopping center  where our marina del rey store is located  on january  on august   we loaned one of our officers  the loan was supported by a full recourse promissory note and accrued interest at per annum 
the full recourse promissory note was paid in full  including accrued interest  upon maturation in february in connection with our initial public offering  our former chief executive officer exercised options to purchase  shares of common stock 
under the agreement granting these options  we were required to pay an amount equal to of the gain recognized by our former chief executive officer for federal income tax purposes  which was  in addition  we loaned our former chief executive officer  which is equal to the difference between the cash payment and the total income tax liability he incurred as a result of this exercise 
the full recourse promissory note was paid in full  including accrued interest  upon maturation in august critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost 
property and equipment is depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the related lease  whichever is shorter 
the lives for furniture  fixtures  and equipment are ten years 
the lives for buildings and leasehold improvements are the shorter of years or the term of the related operating lease 
long lived asset impairments we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including restaurant sites and other assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable 
the asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the related asset s carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their fair values 
the net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset are determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal specialists 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales process are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of local operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
for properties to be closed that are under long term lease agreements the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using risk free rates and net of expected sublease rental that could be 
table of contents reasonably obtained for the property is recognized as a liability and expensed 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect net recoverable values 
internal specialists estimate the subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on their historical experience and knowledge of the market in which the store to be closed is located  the results of our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions 
specific real estate markets  the economic environment and inflation affect the actual cost of disposition for these leases and related assets 
during the years ended december  and december   we determined that certain identified property and equipment was impaired and as such  incurred impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
there was no remaining net book value associated with any of these properties at december  self insurance our business is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
we record our self insurance liability  determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
any actuarial projection of ultimate losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
sources of this variability are numerous and include  but are not limited to  future economic conditions  court decisions and legislative actions 
our workers compensation future funding estimates anticipate no change in the benefit structure 
statutory changes could have a significant impact on future claim costs 
our workers compensation liabilities are from claims occurring in various states 
individual state workers compensation regulations have received a tremendous amount of attention from state politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen an escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting our business 
the changes in a state s political and economic environment increase the variability in the unpaid claim liabilities 
income taxes the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely than not of realization in future periods 
restaurant and franchise revenues revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
all fees from franchised operations are included in revenue as earned 
royalty fees are based on franchised restaurants revenues and are recorded by the company in the period the related franchised restaurants revenues are earned 
pre opening costs the company follows statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which was issued by the accounting standards executive committee and provides guidance on the financial reporting of the start up costs and organization costs 
the sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages but does not require a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock 
table of contents options or similar equity instruments 
sfas no 
allows an entity to elect to continue to measure compensation costs under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  but requires pro forma disclosure of net earnings as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied 
the company elected to follow apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb no 
 because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued several statements of financial accounting standards sfas 
the statements relevant to our line of business and the impact on us are as follows in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for the quarter ending december  for variable interest entities vies created before february  fin establishes criteria to identify vies and the primary beneficiary of such entities 
entities that qualify as vies must be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
all other holders of interests in a vie must disclose the nature  purpose  size and activity of the vie as well as their maximum exposure to losses as a result of involvement with the vie 
the company adopted fin in the third quarter of we currently have no vies and therefore the adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires that certain instruments that were previously classified as equity on a company s statement of financial position now be classified as liabilities 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june  we currently have no instruments impacted by the adoption of this statement and therefore the adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  sfas no 
clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in sfas no 
 clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of underlying to conform it to the language used in fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
we currently have no derivative instruments therefore the adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which requires that cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the customer s income statement 
these rules are applied to new arrangements  including modifications of existing arrangements  entered into after december  the adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than three months as of the date of purchase 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in market prices related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of december  we held million in marketable securities 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  we have a million line of credit agreement with bank of america  na that expires on june  interest on the line of credit is calculated on either the bank base rate minus or libor plus 
currently  there is no outstanding balance under this agreement 
should we draw on this line in the future  changes in interest rates would affect the interest expense on these loans and  therefore  impact our prospective cash flows and results of operations 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of no more than one year 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
