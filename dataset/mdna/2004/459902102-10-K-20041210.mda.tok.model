table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview business segments we design  develop  manufacture  distribute and sell computerized gaming machines and system products in all jurisdictions where gaming is legal 
our two primary revenue sources are product sales and gaming operations 
we strive to maintain a diversified business strategy with our presence in most worldwide gaming markets and the breadth of our product offerings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we finalized changes to our organizational structure and management responsibilities to cover all products in distinct geographical areas 
this reorganization included an evolving realignment of our sales organization  which began with the appointment of our new ceo in october the new structure shifted our focus to managing the business by customer regions encompassing all sources and types of revenues 
operating results reviewed by our chief decision makers encompass all sources of revenues within specific regions 
we currently view our business in two operating segments  each incorporating all relevant revenues from product sales and gaming operations the north america division encompasses our operations in the us and canada  including the igt systems group the international division oversees our efforts abroad in australia  new zealand  europe  latin america  south africa  the uk and japan our business segments are designed to allocate resources within a framework of management responsibility 
operating costs from one segment may benefit the other segments 
we continually evaluate the alignment of our business development and sales organizations for reporting purposes  which may result in changes to segment allocations 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current management view and presentation 
the corporate division manages certain unallocated income and expenses related to company wide initiatives  including capital deployment  treasury and cash management  as well as administrative and oversight functions  such as human resources  information systems  and legal 
the corporate division includes all debt related costs  including interest and losses on early retirements  as well as interest income and gains or losses on investment securities  hedging instruments and other corporate assets 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for revenues and financial results of our business segments 
capital deployment our fiscal capital deployment initiatives included the early redemption of million of our outstanding fixed rate senior notes cash dividends paid of million the repurchase of million shares for an aggregate price of million initiation of construction projects for a new las vegas campus consolidating several leased facilities and expansion of the reno facility we increased our liquidity by nearly million as a result of entering into a new billion senior credit facility and the subsequent redemption of our senior notes 
recent developments acres acquisition on october   we completed the acquisition of acres  a systems software development company serving the gaming industry worldwide 
acres provides bonusing and cashless gaming products  as well as a full suite of integrated casino management systems  with patented technology designed to enable casino operators to increase patron loyalty 
this strategic business combination provides us the ability to utilize the acres technology in developing more integrated gaming systems products increase our competitive marketing capacity position igt as a leading provider of gaming systems products during fiscal  we completed the integration of the igt systems group with acres  combining all development efforts  sales  service and operational organizations related to software systems 

table of contents effects of recently issued accounting standards as the result of adopting financial accounting standards board interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  we consolidated the new jersey and iowa progressive trust vies 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for information about the adoption of fin for the last six months of fiscal  we consolidated million in revenues and million in related expenses of the vies  as well as million in total assets and liabilities  primarily consisting of jackpot liabilities and related assets 
although the vie consolidations had no material impact to gross profit or net income  our quarterly gaming operations gross margin was reduced by approximately percentage points pp 
with the adoption of emerging issues task force eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eps  in our quarter ending december   we will include our outstanding contingently convertible debenture shares in diluted eps regardless of whether the market price trigger has occurred  as well as restate comparative prior period diluted eps  to include the effect of our debenture shares since the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal these restatements will reduce diluted eps by approximately per diluted share in each quarter  resulting in a reduction of approximately for fiscal year and a reduction of approximately for fiscal fiscal diluted eps was already reduced by since our debentures met the conversion criteria for application of the if converted method under existing accounting rules 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole  and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from initial estimates 
critical accounting estimates require igt s management to make material subjective or complex judgments about matters that are highly uncertain or variable to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions to be used for recording certain financial transactions 
these areas of our accounting estimates are also the most sensitive to change from external factors 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
jackpot liabilities and expenses we estimate our jackpot liability based on the jackpot life cycle  volume of slot play and jackpots won on each system 
we also defer jackpot expense for the initial progressive meter liability on a new system 
the deferred amounts are subsequently amortized to jackpot expense as the future contribution revenues are generated from the coin in or slot play 
our jackpot liabilities totaled million at september   including million for our vies  and million at september  we maintain available cash and investments at sufficient levels to fund our jackpot liabilities 
we use current market rates weighted according to the historical pattern of winners payment elections to calculate the present value of our outstanding progressive jackpot liabilities 
we believe this calculation provides the best estimate of our cost to fund future jackpots 
our jackpot expense totaled million for fiscal  including million for our vies over the last six months  and million in fiscal the majority of material changes to jackpot expense relate to the volume of slot play and market interest rate trends see item a  market risk 
changes in our estimates and assumptions regarding the number of jackpot winners who may elect single payments in the future could also impact jackpot expense  as well as the estimated current and non current portions of our jackpot liabilities 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on our accounting policies 
intangible assets  including goodwill and prepaid royalties we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually  and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or warrant a revision to the estimated remaining useful life  in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  allocation of related goodwill  assignment of corporate shared assets and liabilities to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on review and application of market multiples related to revenues and earnings of similar public companies 
under the income approach  we perform a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using our forecasted future cash flows and application of an appropriate discount rate 
our forecasted future cash flows used to test the recoverability or determine the fair value of intangibles are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans used to manage the underlying business 
factors used in our evaluations of potential impairment and fair value require significant judgments about respective estimated useful lives  risk rates  forecasted growth rates  brand history  expected market growth  competitive environment  market share  future business prospects and success of our products 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of recoverability or fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives  recoverability and fair values 
our goodwill and intangible assets totaled billion at september  and billion at september  if the estimated fair value or useful lives of our intangible assets were to decrease  the most significant impact would be an increase to amortization expense and or impairment  thereby decreasing our results of operations 
we recorded no goodwill impairment charges in fiscal years   or 
table of contents we also regularly evaluate the estimated future benefit of prepaid royalties  as well as minimum commitments not yet paid  to determine amounts unlikely to be realized from forecasted sales or placements of our games 
if actual or revised forecasts fall below the initial estimate  then we may need to revise the remaining useful life and or record additional charges 
the carrying value of our prepaid and deferred royalties totaled million at september  and million at september  income taxes determination of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors  including estimates of the timing and probability of realization of deferred income taxes and the timing of income tax payments 
we adjust deferred taxes based on the changes in the difference between the book and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by future tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
this process involves estimating our current tax position in each federal  state  and foreign jurisdiction  as well as making judgments as to whether our taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recover any deferred tax assets 
we establish a valuation allowance to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other jurisdictions based on our estimate of the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of liabilities could result in the recognition of a future tax benefit 
if our tax liabilities are understated  a charge to our tax provision would result 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates  geographic mix or the estimated level of annual taxable income could change our valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which in turn impacts our effective tax rate and tax provision 
our net deferred tax assets totaled million at september  and million at september  our accrued income taxes totaled million at september  and million at september  bad debt expense we analyze historical collection trends  customer concentrations and creditworthiness  economic trends and anticipated changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts for specific and general risks 
changes in our assumptions and estimates could change our estimated provision for bad debt  thereby impacting our operating income 
our allowances for doubtful accounts  notes  and contracts receivable totaled million at september  and million at september  inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally  one year or less 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to adjust manufacturing output accordingly  we may need to record additional charges for inventory obsolescence  which would have a negative impact on our gross profit 
if we experience a significant unexpected decrease in demand for our products or a higher occurrence of inventory obsolescence because of changes in technology or customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory provisions 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times versus the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
our inventories totaled million at september  and million at september

north america division segment profit margin improved in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased gross profit margins and operational efficiencies 
we expect north america product sales gross profit margin to run approximately to in fiscal  on the continued strength of stronger price realization  a greater mix of non machine related revenues and continued material cost reductions and benefits from expansion within existing gaming markets 

table of contents at the end of fiscal  we estimated  machines in the market remained ready candidates for tito technology 
we expect replacement demand in north america to continue over the next few years 
however  we expect that the record pace experienced in the current fiscal year will slow down  due in large part to the fact that our largest casino customers have already converted approximately of their slot floors  on average  to cashless gaming machines 
additionally  most canadian provinces have now fulfilled their replacement programs 
we anticipate shipments to new and expanding properties will strengthen in fiscal as a result of planned new property openings and expansions

in japan  nobunaga tm was our highest selling pachisuro game ever at  units 
these increases were offset by fewer shipments in the uk and australia 
we expect game introductions on new platforms in japan during fiscal as a result of our new partnership with the sammy corporation  a manufacturer in the pachisuro market 
during fiscal we entered the expanding russian market and anticipate that our efforts will gain momentum during fiscal over the next five years we also foresee other opportunities for international gaming expansion  including the uk  the asia pacific regions including macau and eastern europe 
international gaming operations revenues are generated primarily from stand alone recurring revenue units 
fiscal international gaming operations revenues improved over fiscal primarily due to increased play levels on increased machine placements in europe and latin america and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
fiscal vs fiscal fiscal international machine shipments declined from fiscal due primarily to lower sales in australia and japan  both impacted by restrictive gaming regulations 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales in europe  with shipments to new or expanding casinos in holland  ukraine  sweden and portugal increased sales in the uk  due to the popularity of new games machines shipped into the new gaming market in south korea fiscal gross profit and margin from international product sales was up over fiscal despite fewer shipments reflecting increased sales in the higher margin european casino markets increased parts and conversion sales in australia favorable foreign currency exchange rates fiscal growth in gaming operations revenues and gross margin over fiscal were a result of the growth in our installed base and favorable exchange rates

fluctuations in payment timing for income taxes offset payment timing for accounts payable and accrued liabilities

payments to winners include both installment based and single payments 
in fiscal  we reclassified all periods to present cash flows related to funding jackpots from financing activities to operating activities 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these reclassifications and how we account for jackpot liabilities 
net cash flows related to jackpot liabilities represent timing differences between the growth in liabilities for progressive jackpots and the actual payments to the winners during the period 
fluctuations in net cash flows to fund jackpots reflect variations in the timing of the jackpot life cycles  the pattern of winners payment elections  and the volume of slot play across all of our progressive systems games 
the consolidation of the progressive systems trust vies in iowa and new jersey also contributed to the increased cash flow volumes related to jackpot investments and liabilities in fiscal

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments to minimize our market risk exposure resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the primary business objective of our hedging program  as defined in our corporate risk management policy  is to minimize the impact of transaction  remeasurement  and specified economic exposures to our net income and earnings per share 
the counter parties to these instruments are major commercial banks and we believe that losses related to credit risk are remote 
we are not party to leveraged derivatives and do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we routinely use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to the nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities of our operations 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
hedging at september   our net foreign currency exposure of million related to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currency was hedged with million in forward currency contracts 
our net foreign currency exposure of million relative to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currency was hedged with million in forward contracts at september  given our foreign exchange position  a adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures 
translation as currency rates change  translation of our foreign currency functional businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of equity 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from our international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in the currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international net assets included the australian dollar  the british pound  the japanese yen and the euro 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted reported equity by approximately million at september  versus million at september  this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one area may or may not be offset by losses from another area 
interest rate risk we estimate interest rate risk as the potential change in the fair value of our debt or earnings resulting from a hypothetical bps adverse change in interest rates 
costs to fund jackpot liabilities fluctuations in prime  treasury and agency rates due to changes in market and other economic conditions directly impact our costs to fund jackpots  and therefore our gross profit in gaming operations 
if interest rates decline  our costs increase  and correspondingly our gross profit declines 
we estimate that a hypothetical decline of bps in interest rates would have reduced our gross profit by approximately million in fiscal year and million in fiscal we do not currently manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
senior notes and related swaps we use various techniques to mitigate the risk associated with future changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of million  primarily to diversify a portion of our debt portfolio between fixed and variable rate instruments 
these swaps were cancelled on july  in conjunction with the early redemption of our remaining million principal outstanding senior notes 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to debt 
convertible debentures price risk the fair value of our debentures is sensitive to changes in both our stock price and interest rates 
assuming interest rates are held constant  we estimate a decrease in our stock price would decrease the fair value of our convertible debentures by million 
assuming our stock price is held constant  we estimate a bps increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our convertible debentures by million
