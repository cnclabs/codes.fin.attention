the following is an analysis of the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
to the extent that the following management s discussion and analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive environment of the mountain and lodging industries  general business and economic conditions  the weather and other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in the company s other filings with the sec 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement included at the end of this section 
overview segment operating results for mountain  lodging and real estate in fiscal significantly exceeded fiscal and fiscal results 
however  the company recorded a net loss in fiscal of million  which included a million pre tax charge related to the retirement of the notes and a million pre tax charge related to the mold remediation efforts at breckenridge terrace 
fiscal resort segment revenue mountain and lodging segments combined increased and resort segment operating results increased over the same period last year while operating in a more normalized macro economic environment and with the travel industry gaining momentum 
the company achieved higher effective ticket prices and increased revenues in ancillary businesses such as ski school  retail rental and food and beverage  benefiting from increased destination international and out of state visitors as well as increased group and corporate business which bolstered both mountain and lodging revenues 
season pass revenues improved as compared to fiscal despite below average snowfall in the peak revenue producing month of march  which negatively impacted third quarter skier visits  both beaver creek and heavenly had record skier visits for the season  and all of the company s ski resorts except keystone had record revenues 
in addition  the leap year provided an extra day of peak season operations 
the real estate segment s performance exceeded expectations for fiscal  due largely to the relief of a million liability related to smith creek metropolitan district scmd capital improvement fees the offset was recorded as a reduction of real estate operating expense as a result of bachelor gulch metropolitan district s bgmd bond issuance in the third quarter of fiscal  the proceeds of which were used to completely pay off all of scmd s outstanding bonds 
for more information regarding the metropolitan districts  see note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
included in each segment s operating results is the favorable impact of the company s previously announced million cost reduction plan 
the company s cost cutting measures included segment specific cost reductions as well as corporate expense reductions which were included in the segments operating results as all the overall corporate selling  general administrative expenses sg a is allocated to the segments 
among these measures  the company mitigated increasing medical costs by modifying insurance eligibility requirements and by working with health care providers to negotiate more favorable rates 
the company also implemented a mandatory time off program for full time employees 
this reduction to the company s cost structure partially offset cost increases associated with annual wage adjustments and inflation incurred in the normal course of business 
the company s cost savings also helped offset approximately million of sarbanes oxley compliance costs incurred in fiscal and increased accounting finance departmental costs due to the addition of resources 
in fiscal  the company also incurred increased incentive compensation expense for the year of million  as a result of the strong segment operating performance for fiscal  which was partially counter balanced by the non recurrence of certain non cash executive compensation expenses  totaling approximately million  which were recorded in fiscal see note  non cash deferred compensation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the items discussed above regarding segment operating results  the following items have impacted the company s fiscal financial results charges of million related to the extinguishment of the company s notes  which were replaced by the notes see note  long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  a mold remediation charge of million related to estimated costs for the correction of the water intrusion and condensation problems at the breckenridge terrace employee housing facility see note  mold remediation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  a net loss of million on disposal of fixed assets related primarily to winter employee uniforms which were replaced in the current fiscal year as the result of a new strategic alliance  the replacement of two lifts at heavenly as part of the company s previously announced capital improvement plans for the resort and vehicle disposals at heavenly  asset impairment charges of million related to the write off of costs for a previously proposed beaver creek gondola project which was replaced by a plan to install two new high speed chairlifts  and the abandonment of a project to relocate beaver creek s maintenance facilities in lieu of choosing an alternative location and the write down of a warehouse facility see note  impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and a net increase in the fair value of the put options resulting in a fiscal loss of million see note  put and call options  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information regarding the company s put options and a million charge related to the minority interests in the net income of consolidated subsidiaries due primarily to improved net income at ssv 
trends  risks and uncertainties the company s management has identified the following important factors as well as risks and uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact the company s future financial performance in connection with the issuance of the notes and the extinguishment of the notes which resulted in a charge of million in fiscal  the company has extended the maturity date on its senior subordinated debts from fiscal to fiscal additionally  the company expects that the debt transactions should result in annual interest savings in excess of million for at least each of the next five years 
as a result  the company does not anticipate it will incur potential losses from the extinguishment of debt for the next several years 
the company budgeted million for calendar capital improvements primarily related to the company s mountain and lodging properties  through which the company plans to continue to improve the quality of its resort experience so that it can continue to charge a premium price 
planned projects are discussed in more detail in liquidity and capital resources 
as of july   the company has spent approximately million of the calendar budgeted capital 
the company has not yet finalized a capital budget for calendar  however  at this time it anticipates resort spending will be consistent with the level of calendar capital spending 
the company has budgeted million for calendar investments in real estate  and is proceeding as planned subject to continuing necessary approvals with its real estate development projects  including the new dawn redevelopment at vail and residential development at jackson hole golf tennis club  although such plans are subject to potential delays or revisions 
based on current real estate development plans  the company believes it could finance such projects within its existing credit facility or through other financing sources including project specific financing which the company believes is readily available 
as of july   the company has spent approximately million of the calendar budgeted capital 
based on the status of several specific projects  the company anticipates it will continue to spend significant amounts over the next several years  however  the revenue the company anticipates to derive from these activities should also significantly exceed historical levels 
guests continue to book reservations closer in to the date of travel  which makes it more difficult to forecast occupancy trends 
the timing and amount of snowfall has a direct impact on skier visits  particularly with respect to in state skiers 
to mitigate this impact  the company focuses efforts on sales of season passes 
the company raised prices on these products for the ski season  and season pass revenues increased over sales for the ski season 
similarly  the company raised prices for the season and early signs indicate favorable trends in volume and dollars 
remediation of the mold problem at breckenridge terrace continues  and while the company s estimates are based on currently available data  actual costs could vary materially favorably or unfavorably from current estimates 
the company anticipates the facility will be available for occupancy for the beginning of the ski season 
the company may not be able to sustain the cost savings achieved in fiscal in future years  or these cost savings could be outweighed by cost increases in other areas 
due to industry consolidation  the company may continue to be subject to pricing pressure at certain of its ski resorts 
the company continues to evaluate strategic acquisitions and dispositions  although no definitive agreements currently exist 
the company is actively pursuing additional hotel management contracts under the rockresorts brand  which is key to the company s growth strategy for its lodging segment 
management has not acquired new management contracts on additional properties  although the company did obtain a new long term management contract at cheeca lodge spa at the time of an ownership change of the property in fiscal potential ownership changes of hotels currently under rockresorts management could result in the termination of existing rockresorts management contracts 
under the rockresorts hotel management contracts for the non company owned rockresorts hotels  the hotel owner may sell its interest at any time  however  the company holds a right of first offer to purchase the hotel 
if the company waives its right to purchase the hotel  and the buyer does not assume the management contract  the management contract will be terminated and the hotel owner shall pay rockresorts a termination fee equal to a the yearly management fees earned by rockresorts multiplied by b the lesser of i three and ii the number of years remaining until expiration of the management contract 
the company operates its ski areas under various forest service permits  which are subject to periodic modification  which can impact how the company operates and develops its ski areas 
there can be no assurances that future changes and modifications to the permits that the company operates under will not have a material adverse impact to the company 
the company operates the gtlc resort properties under a concession contract with the national park service nps that expired on december  and which has been extended until such time that a new contract is awarded 
the company believes it is well positioned to obtain a new concession contract on satisfactory terms  however  the company cannot predict or guarantee its success 
if the company were not successful in obtaining a new contract with the nps  it would be entitled to be compensated by the successful bidder for the value of its possessory interest in the assets 
however  the loss of this contract  if it were to happen  could impact the future results of the lodging segment 
the company generally pre sells residential units to ensure the economic viability of a development 
pre sales require the buyer to provide an earnest money deposit to the company  which is refundable to the buyer should the company fail to complete the related development 
real estate deposits recorded as liabilities on the company s books were million and million as of july  and  respectively 
the company has numerous investments in entities over which the company does not have direct management oversight 
as such  it is difficult for management to predict or influence the financial performance of these entities  and such results could materially impact the company s consolidated results of operations 
terrorist incidents and or military hostilities can have and have had an adverse impact on the travel industry and  consequently  the company 
there can be no certainty regarding future occurrence or non occurrence of terrorist incidents or military hostilities and any resulting impact to the company 
the timing of major holidays can impact vacation patterns  and as such can impact visitation at the company s ski resorts 
in fiscal  christmas falls on a saturday  which could result in softer visitation for this holiday period as compared to prior years 
however  easter falls in march in  which management anticipates will be favorable versus s mid april easter holiday 
in addition  was a leap year  which provided an extra day of peak season operations 
the company uses estimates to record certain reserves including  but not limited to  self insured medical and workers compensation reserves  legal liability reserves and income tax reserves 
if actual results vary significantly from such estimates  or if future trends are not indicative of historical experience  the company s results from operations could be materially impacted see critical accounting policies for more information regarding these reserve estimates 
the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified elsewhere in this document 
results of operations presented below is a more detailed analysis and comparative data regarding the company s results of operations for the fiscal years ended july   and the following analysis includes discussion of financial performance within each of the company s segments 
the company has chosen to specifically address a non gaap measure  reported ebitda defined as segment net revenues less segment specific operating expenses plus gain on transfer of property  as applicable  plus segment equity income  in the following discussion because management considers this measurement to be a significant indication of the company s financial performance 
the company evaluates performance and allocates resources to its segments based on reported ebitda 
refer to the end of the results of operations section or note  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of reported ebitda to income loss before benefit provision for income taxes 
reported ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
items excluded from reported ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
reported ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or substitute for  net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because reported ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  reported ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies mountain segment mountain segment operating results for the fiscal years ended july   and are presented by category as follows in thousands  except etp amounts fiscal year ended july  percentage change increase decrease unaudited lift tickets ski school dining retail rental other total mountain net operating revenue total mountain operating expense mountain equity income  net total mountain reported ebitda total skier visits etp mountain segment operating revenues and reported ebitda have increased significantly since fiscal in fiscal  mountain reported ebitda increased over fiscal  as increased lift revenues  driven by a improvement in etp  and commensurate increases in all ancillary revenue categories were combined with only a increase in operating expenses  driven by the cost cutting initiatives and the low variable cost nature of the mountain business 
from fiscal to fiscal  mountain reported ebitda increased by driven primarily by the acquisition of heavenly in june in fiscal  etp  which is calculated by dividing lift ticket revenue by total skier visits  grew over fiscal due to a combination of increased skier visitation in the destination guest demographic  price increases and a decline in average days skied by season pass holders 
during fiscal  the us travel industry began to recover from the effects of the terrorist attacks of september  and the iraqi war in fiscal as a result  the skier visit mix changed in fiscal compared to the two prior fiscal years as more out of state and international guests  who typically pay higher prices for lift ticket products  visited the company s ski resorts 
in addition to the skier visit mix change  the company is able to charge premium prices for its premier products  and as such  has been able to implement price increases across the board in its lift ticket products 
lastly  while fiscal season pass revenues increased over fiscal  season pass holder visitation decreased 
the combination of increased season pass revenues and decreased visitation drove season pass etp up 
the decline in year over year season pass visitation  attributed to the unusually warm temperatures in the month of march  is the primary reason for the decrease in overall skier visits from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  etp was flat compared to fiscal due to the significant downturn in the destination travel industry as a result of the september  terrorist attacks and the iraqi war which began in march  typically the company s peak operating month 
the increase in destination guest visitation at the company s ski resorts favorably impacted the entire mountain segment in fiscal as  in addition to buying higher priced lift ticket products  destination guests generally spend more on ancillary services such as ski school  dining and retail rental 
ssv s operations saw significant improvements in fiscal  due to the improved destination mix discussed above as well as maturation of the market at the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch and improved performance at heavenly 
fiscal revenues and skier visits were heavily influenced by the acquisition of heavenly in june the company has been able to successfully integrate and improve upon the ski resort s operations since the acquisition 
in fiscal  the heavenly acquisition resulted in losses for the mountain segment due to the timing of the acquisition during the resort s off season 
fiscal benefited from a full year of operations  and fiscal saw further growth from heavenly due to capital improvements completed by the company and implementation of the company s management strategy at the resort 
a significant portion of the mountain segment s operating expenses are fixed costs  with little variability as sales volumes increase or decrease 
in fiscal  the company changed its cost structure to decrease the amount of fixed costs in the mountain segment through staffing changes  reduced marketing costs  changes in summer trail maintenance and more closely monitoring the hours of certain dining establishments 
the mountain segment also benefited from cost reductions realized in corporate sg a expenses 
these changes to the cost structure helped offset normal cost increases associated with inflation  payroll increases and energy prices as well as increased incentive compensation 
in fiscal  mountain operating expenses rose primarily as a result of the heavenly acquisition and an increase in corporate sg a expenses due to increasing medical and workers compensation costs 
in fiscal  the company began consolidating several entities under fin r four entities  breckenridge terrace  the tarnes at bc  llc tarnes  bc housing  llc bc housing and tenderfoot seasonal housing  llc tenderfoot  collectively known as the employee housing entities  and avon partners ii  llc apii  which had previously been accounted for under the equity method 
as a result  the consolidation of the allocated portion of the employee housing entities as of november  and apii as of february  caused a million and a million increase in other mountain operating revenue and mountain operating expense  respectively  in fiscal lodging segment lodging segment operating results for the fiscal years ended july   and are presented by category as follows dollars in thousands except adr fiscal year ended july  percentage change increase decrease unaudited total lodging net operating revenue total lodging operating expense lodging equity loss  net total lodging reported ebitda average daily rate adr lodging segment operating revenues and reported ebitda have increased significantly compared to fiscal before equity investment losses related almost entirely to bachelor gulch resort  llc bg resort  which opened in november  fiscal lodging reported ebitda improved and as compared to fiscal and  respectively 
the lodging segment rebounded in fiscal as compared to fiscal due in part to the recovery in the overall travel industry  as well as internal improvements related to the company s lodging assets 
for instance  vail marriott s revenues increased approximately million primarily as a result of the recent renovation 
red sky ranch results improved with the opening of the norman course in june and further maturation of operations 
additionally  revenue growth was also driven by the increase in adr  which is a function of both increased pricing and slightly increased occupancy 
fiscal suffered largely due to the industry slow down and geopolitical unrest 
fiscal revenue growth came primarily from additional revenues at vail marriott as newly renovated rooms came back on line since renovations began in december and full year revenues derived from the acquisitions of the lodge at rancho mirage and rockresorts million 
the company has taken a new approach to managing costs in the lodging segment that contributed to the overall increase in lodging reported ebitda in fiscal typically  many of the lodging segment costs will increase in proportion to revenues  however  the company has employed several new measures such as closing seasonal properties during their respective off seasons and furloughing employees during slower times to reduce the permanent lodging segment cost structure 
the lodging segment also benefited from cost reductions realized in corporate sg a expenses 
these changes to the cost structure helped offset normal cost increases associated with increased revenues and inflation as well as increased incentive compensation 
fiscal operating expenses were up sharply from fiscal due to an increase in corporate sg a expenses resulting from increased medical and workers compensation costs  increased management staffing and administrative costs associated with the formation of the rockresorts brand and inclusion of rockresorts  vail marriott and the lodge at rancho mirage for the full fiscal year 
lodging equity loss  net  primarily includes the company s share of results from bg resort  which owns and operates the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch that opened in november bg resort equity losses have significantly impacted lodging segment operating results 
fiscal equity losses for bg resort included million of expense associated with pre opening costs 
the equity losses associated with bg resort include a proportionate share of depreciation and interest expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as the company accounts for bg resort under the equity method 
the consolidation of the employee housing entities as of november  caused a  and a  increase in lodging operating revenue and lodging operating expense  respectively  in fiscal real estate segment real estate segment operating results for the fiscal years ended july   and are presented by major project categories as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year ended july  percentage change increase decrease unaudited single family land sales multi family land sales residential condominiums other total real estate net operating revenue gain on transfer of property total real estate operating expense real estate equity income  net total real estate reported ebitda the company s real estate operating revenues are primarily determined by the mix of real estate development sold in any given year 
different types of projects have greatly different revenue and expense volumes  therefore  as the sales inventory mix changes it can greatly impact real estate segment operating revenues and operating expenses  and to a lesser degree  real estate reported ebitda 
fiscal real estate operating revenues were down compared to fiscal due to fewer residential condominium sales due to a reduced number of units in inventory 
the real estate segment reported ebitda improved in fiscal due primarily to the million scmd capital improvement fee liability which was relieved in fiscal and was recorded as a reduction in real estate operating expense see note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the capital improvement fee liability 
although the company had fewer land unit sales in fiscal  the company realized a higher profit margin on a land unit basis as compared to fiscal real estate equity income  net decreased in fiscal primarily due to the decrease in activities at kred following the distribution of most of its assets to the partners in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for more information regarding the distribution 
fiscal real estate operating expense benefited from the reduced corporate sg a expense 
in addition  the company recorded a million gain on the transfer of property related to executive non cash deferred compensation see note  non cash deferred compensation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
in fiscal  real estate reported ebitda increased due to the large volume of condominiums sold  primarily consisting of sales at the mountain thunder lodge development and luxury condominiums at the vail marriott 
fiscal real estate reported ebitda also included the sale of of the luxury condominiums developed at the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch 
real estate operating expenses have generally varied in proportion with the inventory types primarily sold in each year 
other items in addition to segment operating results  the following material items contribute to the company s overall financial position 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense has increased over the last two fiscal years 
in general  the company s depreciation and amortization expense increase is attributable to an increased fixed asset base due to normal capital expenditures 
additionally  a portion of the increase in fiscal was due to the consolidation of the employee housing entities under fin r million and a large portion of the fiscal increase was due to the acquisitions of heavenly  rancho mirage  rockresorts and the vail marriott million 
the average depreciation rate was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
asset impairment charge 
the company recorded a million impairment charge in fiscal after abandoning development of certain projects related to a proposed gondola and a maintenance facility and the write down of a warehouse facility 
the company also recorded a million impairment charge in fiscal related to an option held on certain development land near vail mountain due to an unexpected adverse decision by the eagle county district court of colorado  rendered on september  in connection with litigation involving the option see note  impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
mold remediation charge 
in fiscal  the company expensed million related to the estimated cost of remediation of water intrusion and condensation problems at its breckenridge terrace employee housing facility based on management s best estimate using a preliminary estimate from the mold remediation facilitators 
see note  mold remediation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information regarding this charge 
loss on disposal of fixed assets 
in fiscal  the company recorded net loss on disposal of fixed assets primarily related to the disposal of a lift which was replaced at heavenly  the disposal of mountain uniforms which were replaced before their originally estimated retirement date and normal disposal activities 
fiscal net loss on disposal consists of normal disposal activities 
interest expense 
the company s primary sources of interest expense are the credit facility  the industrial development bonds and the senior subordinated notes 
overall  interest expense decreased from fiscal to due to the replacement of the notes with the notes  reduced pricing of the term loan portion of the credit facility and lower average borrowings on the credit facility  partially offset by increased borrowing under the notes and the consolidation of the employee housing entities under fin r 
interest expense increased from fiscal to due to a full year of interest expense related to the november issuance of an incremental million principal amount of notes and an increase in credit facility borrowings due to the fiscal acquisitions 
average borrowings under the credit facility were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal loss on extinguishment of debt 
the company recorded a million debt extinguishment charge in fiscal in connection with the tender for the notes 
the charge included a tender premium of per  principal amount of notes  which accounts for million of the total charge 
other costs in the charge include transaction fees  the write off of unamortized issuance costs and unamortized original issue discount on the notes  and other costs such as legal and printing fees 
in connection with the tender for the notes  in january the company issued the notes 
the proceeds from the notes were used to repurchase the notes  along with associated premiums  fees and expenses 
see note  long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain loss on put option 
the value of put options fluctuates based on forecasted financial performance of certain rockresorts managed properties  ssv and rtp as of the put exercise period 
the put options net loss in fiscal is primarily due to an increase in the estimated value of the put option that the minority shareholder in ssv has to the company 
the put options net gain recorded in fiscal is due primarily to a decrease in the estimated value of the put option that olympus has to the company with respect to rockresorts 
see note  put and call options  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information regarding the company s put options 
minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries is a function of the performance of the company s consolidated subsidiaries 
improvement in ssv s net income is primarily responsible for the increase in minority interest in fiscal income taxes 
the changes in the company s effective tax rate are driven primarily by the amount of pre tax income loss  non deductible executive compensation and taxable income generated by state jurisdictions that varies from the consolidated pre tax income loss 
the effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the company entered into a closing agreement with the internal revenue service  which successfully closed the tax years

in february  the sec informed the company that it had issued a formal order of investigation with respect to the company 
in october  the sec issued a subpoena to the company to produce documents related to several matters  including the sale of memberships in private clubs 
in november  the sec issued an additional subpoena to the company to produce documents related primarily to the restated items included in the company s form k for the year ended july  in april and june  the sec issued additional subpoenas to the company and made  and continues to make  voluntary requests to the company to provide documents and information primarily related to further information on prior requests  as well as other items 
certain current and former officers and employees of the company have appeared or are expected to appear for testimony before the sec pursuant to subpoena 
the company is fully cooperating with the sec in its investigation 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the investigation or any action that the sec might take  including the imposition of fines and penalties  or other available remedies 
any adverse development in connection with the investigation  including any expansion of the scope of the investigation  could have a material adverse effect on us  including diverting the efforts and attention of our management team from our business operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s overall liquidity improved in factors that contributed to the liquidity improvement include a significant increase in operating cash flows  primarily driven by increased segment operating results  the company paid off its revolver balance under the credit facility as of july  as a result of the increase in operating cash flows  the company s funded debt ebitda ratio  as defined in the credit facility which excludes the employee housing bonds  in addition to other adjustments improved by over one full turn as of july  versus july the company paid off current maturities  including million for the olympus note  certain capital leases and contractual term loan payments under the credit facility during fiscal  and replacement of the notes with the notes which lowered the interest rate and extended their maturity 
cash flows the company has historically provided for operating expenditures  debt service  capital expenditures and acquisitions through a combination of cash flow from operations including sales of real estate and short term and long term borrowings 
operating cash flows in fiscal increased million over fiscal due primarily to the significant improvements in resort segment operating results of million  million of deposits received for real estate sales  collection of million of income tax refunds in fiscal versus estimated tax payments of million in fiscal  improved accounts receivable collections resulting in a million increase in operating cash and million of increased advance sales of season passes  partially offset by a million decrease in real estate segment operating results net of non cash costs of sales  an million decrease in sales of new private club memberships due to red sky ranch in fiscal and a million increase in restricted cash due to increases in statutorily required workers compensation balances and increased reserves for capital improvements required under the vail marriott franchise agreement 
fiscal operating cash flows improved million as compared to fiscal due largely to a million increase in real estate segment operating results net of non cash costs of sales  a million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments  million in increased season pass sales and million in increased deferred compensation and a million decrease in notes receivable resulting primarily from payments received  partially offset by timing of estimated tax payments and the decreased collection of million of red sky ranch initiation fees 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal decreased by million primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures 
fiscal capital expenditures are more normalized as capital expenditures approximate the company s calendar budgeted capital and what it anticipates to spend on an annual basis going forward 
in addition to normal capital expenditures made to sustain the company s existing asset base  the company s capital expenditures also included i a new high speed chairlift at beaver creek  ii keystone and heavenly snowmaking upgrades  iii installation of two new high speed chairlifts at heavenly  iv an electrical distribution network at keystone and v renovations at the lodge at rancho mirage 
fiscal capital expenditures include the renovation of the vail marriott  the acquisition of the spa at the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch and completion of the norman course at red sky ranch and member clubhouse 
fiscal cash flows used in investing activities decreased million from fiscal due almost entirely to the fiscal acquisitions of heavenly  the lodge at rancho mirage  the vail marriott and rockresorts 
the company has not yet finalized a capital budget for calendar  however  at this time it anticipates capital expenditures will be consistent with the approximately million calendar capital budget 
the company typically spends million annually to sustain its existing resort assets 
based on the status of several specific real estate projects  the company will continue to invest significant amounts in real estate over the next several years 
the company plans to fund these capital expenditures through operating cash flows as well as availability under its credit facility or project specific financing 
completion of planned projects may be dependent upon necessary regulatory approval 
during fiscal  financing activities consisted of the issuance of the notes  the proceeds of which were used to tender and call the notes and pay the related tender and call premiums and expenses 
in addition  the company used excess cash from operating activities net of investing activities to pay off the revolver under the credit facility  pay off the million olympus note  pay down million of liabilities assumed in the kred distribution and had excess cash invested at the end of the fiscal year 
ssv was able to significantly reduce the balance of the ssv facility due to cash generated from its improved operating results 
during fiscal  financing activities used million in cash  primarily consisting of million in net long term debt repayments  million in payments of financing costs and million in distributions to minority shareholders in joint ventures 
during fiscal  financing activities provided million in cash  primarily consisting of million in net long term debt borrowings and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  net of million in payments of financing costs 
capital structure the company s capital structure was primary impacted in fiscal by the following items events the replacement of the notes with the notes which lowered interest expense by over million per year for at least the next five years and extended the term of the notes from fiscal to fiscal  the amendment of the credit facility which extended the term loan two years and lowered the term loan interest rate libor margin by  the olympus note was repaid in august  the revolver under the credit facility was fully paid off as of july   the ssv facility was reduced by approximately million and the consolidation of the employee housing bonds under fin r which increased the company s debt balance by million 
the consolidation of the employee housing bonds should not noticeably impact the company s debt service cash flow requirements since the employee housing entities have been structured to essentially be cash self sufficient after the servicing of the related debt 
as a result of the company s operating performance in fiscal  it has also improved its interest rate margins which are adjusted based on performance under the funded debt leverage covenant  as defined in the credit facility that may help buffer future libor increases 
in fiscal  the company amended and restated its existing credit facility to provide debt financing up to an aggregate principal amount of million through a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan and ssv amended and restated the ssv facility as a three year revolving credit facility which provides for debt financing up to an aggregate principal amount of million 
for additional information regarding the company s debt arrangements  see note  long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company replaced the notes with the notes in fiscal in january  million  or approximately  of the notes were tendered for total consideration of  per  principal amount of notes 
in may  the company called the remaining outstanding notes for a price of of the principal balance 
the replacement notes were issued for million in january the proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to tender and call the notes  with the excess used to pay the tender fees and other issuance expenses 
in february  the company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec in connection with the potential offer and sale  from time to time  of up to million of its common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
the company filed the registration statement so that it has the flexibility to raise capital if and when favorable economic or business conditions dictate 
the company currently does not anticipate it will have any activity under this shelf registration 
in february  apollo ski partners  lp apollo sold approximately million shares of the company s class a common stock 
apollo owns substantially all of the class a common stock  shares as of july  of the company and  consequently  has the ability to elect all of the company s class board of directors 
at the time of sale  the shares sold were converted to shares of common stock 
for additional information about apollo s ownership in the company  see note  subsequent events  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
improvement of the company s capital structure is dependent on continued improvement in its operating results 
that improvement could be negatively impacted by financing options for specific projects or by the inability to favorably refinance as maturities come due 
liquidity needs management believes the company is in a position to satisfy its current working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months with current cash flows from operations and availability under the credit facility  however  the company may look at alternative financing arrangements for specific projects 
the company s debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as the company  as of july   had million of variable interest rate debt 
a basis point change in libor would cause the company s annual interest expense to change by approximately million 
the fluctuation in the company s debt service requirements  in addition to interest rate changes  may be impacted by future borrowings under its credit facility or other alternative financing arrangements it may enter into 
the company s long term liquidity needs are dependent upon operating results which impact its availability under its credit facility  which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital expenditures  flexibility of investment activities and the ability to obtain favorable future financing 
the company manages changes in the business and economic environment by managing its capital expenditures and real estate development activities 
covenants and limitations the company must abide by certain restrictive financial covenants in relation to its bank credit facilities and senior subordinated notes 
the most restrictive of those covenants include the funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  senior debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum net worth and the interest coverage ratio as defined in the underlying credit facilities 
in addition  the company s financing arrangements limit its ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  make certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit its ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility is primarily determined by the funded debt to ebitda ratio  which is based on the company s segment operating performance 
the company was in compliance with all relevant covenants in its debt instruments as of july  the company expects it will meet all applicable quarterly financial tests in its debt instruments  including the funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  in fiscal however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  the company would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit facility 
while the company anticipates that it would obtain such waiver or amendment  if any were necessary  there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on the liquidity of the company 
in fiscal  the company obtained a waiver 
the credit facility was amended on october   with a july  effective date  to increase the funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  to be measured for the covenant compliance periods ending july  and october  contractual obligations as part of its ongoing operations  the company enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements and debt agreements 
debt obligations  which total million  are currently recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
operating lease obligations  which total million  are not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet  which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations at the end of fiscal is as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total fiscal year years years more than years long term debt operating leases and service contracts purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations purchase obligations include amounts which are classified as trade payables  accrued payroll and benefits  accrued fees and assessments  accrued interest  and liabilities including advances to complete real estate projects on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of july  and other obligations for goods and services not yet recorded 
other long term obligations include amounts which become due based on deficits in underlying cash flows of a metropolitan district as described in note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amount has been recorded as a liability of the company  however  the specific time period of performance is currently unknown 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have material off balance transactions that are expected to have an effect on the company s financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
the company has ownership interests in employee housing entities which were formed to construct  own and operate employee housing facilities in exchange for rent payments from tenants in and around beaver creek  keystone and breckenridge 
the employee housing entities were formerly off balance sheet arrangements  accounted for under the equity method 
in connection with the company s implementation of fin r  the company determined it is the primary beneficiary of the employee housing entities and consolidated them in its consolidated financial statements as of november  critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires the company to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions or assessments 
the company also has other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
real estate held for sale 
the company utilizes the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales for individual parcels of real estate or condominium units sold within a project 
cost of sales under the relative sales value method utilizes significant estimates for both the ultimate total revenues to be generated and total costs to be incurred on a real estate development project 
real estate development projects generally span several years 
changes to cost of sales percentages for a project based upon changes in the estimates are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis for past sales recorded in the current fiscal year  other changes are accounted for on a prospective basis 
as a result  changes in the estimates underlying the cost of sales calculation can cause significant variances in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue applied year to year throughout the life of a project  however  changes in the estimates do not impact the aggregate amount of revenue or cost of sales ultimately recognized 
the percentage of completion method is used for revenue recognition on real estate sales for which the company has not completed its obligations to the buyer at the time of closing 
this requires estimation of the total cost to complete the obligations to determine the amount of revenue to recognize on a periodic basis 
while changes in the estimates used to calculate the percent complete affect the timing of revenue recognition  the changes do not affect the aggregate amount of revenue or costs ultimately recognized 
deferred club initiation fees 
revenues from club initiation fees are initially deferred and recognized over the expected life of the club facilities 
the life of the club facilities is an estimate determined by management based on consideration of standard building life estimates 
changes in the estimates of the club facilities lives do not impact the aggregate amount of club related revenues recognized  however  the changes would impact the timing of the revenue recognition 
if an estimate is changed  the remaining club revenues would be recognized in a straight line pattern over the new remaining life of the club facilities 
medical reserves 
the company is self insured for employee medical plans 
the company accrues for claims which have been incurred but not reported based upon an actuarial analysis of the historical lag between the time a claim occurs and when it is paid 
variances in actual claims experience versus the actuarial reserve can affect the timing of medical claims expense between fiscal years 
although the company is self insured for medical coverage  it does have stop loss coverage 
workers compensation reserves 
the company is self insured for workers compensation for its operations in the state of colorado 
workers compensation claims are reserved for based on actuarial estimates for the ultimate development of existing claims  claims incurred but not yet reported and the re opening of a claim that has been closed 
variances in actual claims experience versus the actuarial reserve can affect the timing of workers compensation expense between fiscal years 
legal claims reserve 
the company accrues estimates for legal claims against the company when management determines that the likelihood of incurring a loss for a claim is both probable and estimable 
estimating possible losses requires forecasts that depend on judgments about potential outcomes that are dependent upon actions by third parties such as regulators 
variances between probable and estimable legal claims reserve and actual losses can affect results of operations 
allowance for accounts receivable 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable based on a specific reserve analysis and on a percentage of related revenues  taking into consideration such factors as historical write offs  the economic climate  third party credit ratings and other factors that could affect collectibility 
write offs are evaluated on a case by case basis 
variances in actual bad debt write offs versus management s estimates results in changes in both the timing and amount of bad debt expense recorded 
mold remediation liability 
the company estimates its liability for mold remediation based on a number of factors including construction and remediation estimates from contractors as discussed further in note  mold remediation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual costs to remediate could vary significantly from the estimate and could be offset by recoveries from other responsible parties 
intangible assets 
the company frequently obtains intangible assets  primarily through business combinations 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the use of a specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus are subject to significant interpretation 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition  ii amortized over their estimated useful life  or iii not amortized  the assigned values could have a material effect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangibles are subject to certain judgments when evaluating impairment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  discussed further in note  supplementary balance sheet information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company tests annually for impairment under sfas no 
as of may such impairment testing is based on forecasted future cash flows of identified reporting units  and involves significant use of estimates 
differences between actual results and the estimates used by the company could result in impairment charges in a period other than the actual period of impairment  or could result in impairment charges that were ultimately unwarranted 
future operating results could dictate significant future non cash impairment charges 
income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires the company to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
this assessment is complicated by the fact that the company files its tax return on a calendar year basis which is different from its fiscal year end 
as of july   the company had total deferred tax assets of million and total deferred tax liabilities of million 
the net deferred tax asset contains a valuation allowance representing the portion that management does not believe will be recovered from future taxable income 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future  primarily through the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities  to realize the benefit of the company s remaining net deferred tax assets 
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenues and profits for the company s mountain and most of its lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  gtlc s and certain managed properties peak operating seasons occur during the summer months while the winter season generally results in operating losses 
however  revenues and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations and management fees from those managed properties are not sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its mountain and other lodging operations 
during the fiscal year  of total combined mountain and lodging revenues were earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of snowfall and other unforeseen external factors 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
see note  selected quarterly financial data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
economic downturn skiing  travel and tourism are discretionary recreational activities that can be impacted by a significant economic slowdown  which  in turn  could impact the company s operating results 
the extended economic downturn in recent years negatively impacted the company s operating results although the company had historically been relatively unaffected by economic downturns 
there can be no assurance that a continued or future decrease in the amount of discretionary spending by the public would not have an adverse effect on the company 
unfavorable weather conditions the ability to attract visitors to ski resorts is influenced by weather conditions and by the amount and timing of snowfall during the ski season 
unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect skier visits  and adversely affect the company s revenues and profits 
in the past years  the company s colorado ski resorts have averaged between and feet of annual snowfall and heavenly receives average yearly snowfall of between and feet  significantly in excess of the average for us ski resorts 
however  there is no assurance that the company s resorts will receive seasonal snowfalls near the historical average in the future 
also  the early season snow conditions and skier perceptions of early season snow conditions influence the momentum and success of the overall season 
in addition  a severe and prolonged drought could affect our otherwise adequate snowmaking water supplies 
unfavorable weather conditions such as drought  hurricanes  tropical storms and tornadoes can adversely affect the company s other resorts and lodging properties as vacationers tend to delay or postpone vacations if weather conditions differ from those that typically prevail at such resorts for a given season 
there is no way for the company to predict future weather patterns or the impact that weather patterns may have on results of operations or visitation 
labor market the company s mountain and lodging operations are largely dependent on a seasonal workforce 
the company recruits worldwide to fill staffing needs each season and utilize visas to enable the use of foreign workers 
in addition  the company manages seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place 
while the company does not currently foresee the need to increase seasonal wages to attract employees  the company cannot guarantee that such an increase will not be necessary in the future 
in addition  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain the visas necessary to hire foreign workers who are an important source for the seasonal workforce 
increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  however  the company is unable to predict with any certainty whether such situations will arise or the potential impact on results of operations 
terrorist acts upon the united states and acts of war the terrorist acts carried out against the united states on september  have had an adverse effect on the global travel and leisure industry 
the war with iraq and its aftermath also had an adverse effect on the company 
the company cannot guarantee if or when normal travel and vacation patterns will resume 
additional terrorist acts against the united states and the threat of or actual war by or upon the united states could result in further degradation of discretionary travel  upon which the company s operations are highly dependent 
such degradation could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   the company had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing of the company s total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during fiscal of 
the company s average interest rate is based on its various credit facilities and any associated letter of credit fees  unused fees and deferred financing charges see note  long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on average floating rate borrowings outstanding during the years ended july   and  a basis point change in libor would have caused the company s annual interest expense to change by million  million and  respectively 
the company s market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
