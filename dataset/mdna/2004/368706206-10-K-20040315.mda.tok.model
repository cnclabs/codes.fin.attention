table of contents item of this annual report on form k in order to fully understand factors that may affect the comparability of the information presented below 
the following table summarizes quarterly financial data unaudited

for  genelabs board of directors determined that certain critical objectives were substantially achieved and designated that objectives had been achieved at of the target level 
however  because of financial constraints  the board also determined that bonuses would only be paid contingent upon genelabs ability in the future to secure a specified level of additional financing 
this additional financing had not been secured at the time the company filed its annual report on form k 
significant uncertainties existed as to whether this financing would be obtained and it was not probable that the bonus would be paid 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of genelabs reversed its provision for accrued bonuses 
in the fourth quarter of  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses decreased from the prior two quarters of because of this unusual circumstance 
the reversal of accrued bonuses lowered research and development expenses by  and general and administrative expenses by  in the fourth quarter of  for a reduction of operating expenses aggregating  in the fourth quarter of  genelabs secured sufficient additional financing to satisfy conditions the board of directors had established for payment of the contingent bonuses  and bonus payments were made aggregating  these payments increased research and development expenses by  and general and administrative expenses by  the board also determined that an important objective for payment of employee bonuses for was the securing of additional financing and additional charges were also accrued in the fourth quarter of the accruals for bonuses aggregated  in the fourth quarter of  of which  was included in research and development and  was included in general and administrative expenses 
as a result of the contingency and the objective both being met during the fourth quarter of  the total charges incurred for the incentive bonus plan during the quarter were  of which  was included in research and development and  was included in general and administrative expenses 
the bonuses were paid out in the first quarter of as a result of these circumstances  the costs recorded in the fourth quarter of aggregate more that what would

all statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical are forward looking statements 
actual results may differ from the forward looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties that are discussed under risk factors in item and elsewhere on this annual report on form k 
shareholders and prospective investors in the company should carefully consider these risk factors 
we disclaim any obligation to update these statements for subsequent events 
genelabs technologies  inc  referred to as genelabs or the company  is a biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products to improve human health 
genelabs is pursuing regulatory approval of prestara  its investigational drug for women with systemic lupus erythematosus  a disease for which no new drug has been approved in the past years and for which current therapies are not adequate 
we are also pursuing the discovery of novel antiviral compounds for treatment of hepatitis c infections  and are initiating preclinical development work in this area 
we believe that these high risk  potentially high reward programs focus our research and development expertise in areas where we have the opportunity to be scientific pioneers and  if successful  we believe that these programs will yield products that will address diseases for which current therapies are inadequate 
at the same time  our established capabilities can be utilized as we diversify our research and development programs 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting estimates which are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations as presented in the financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we continue involvement through a collaboration or other obligation is recognized ratably over the development period 
unearned contract revenue at december  and at december   is from a single source  an up front payment received in from watson pharmaceuticals  inc  referred to as watson  for our license to them of the north american marketing rights to prestara 
genelabs management considers the amortization period for the up front payment from watson a critical accounting estimate 
the amortization period we use is based on our current estimate of the period we have significant obligations to watson 
in august  the fda issued an approvable letter to genelabs for prestara  citing issues to be addressed prior to approval  including  among other things  the successful completion of an additional clinical trial to confirm the positive effect of prestara on bone mineral density previously observed in women with mild to moderate lupus while on low dose glucocorticoids 
genelabs management believes that its significant obligations under the agreement with watson extend to the submission of a complete response to the approvable letter to the fda and the fda reaching a final decision regarding approval of the nda 
the date upon which we may receive a final fda decision on approval will vary based on  among other things  the time period necessary for analysis of the results of the clinical trial  what the results of the trial are  our preparation of a re submission to the fda  and the length of time the fda will take to review the data submitted after the conclusion of the trial 
genelabs currently estimates that it will take until june for an fda decision on the nda 
the estimated period for amortization has a noteworthy impact on the revenue recognized  and  in turn  the net loss reported in genelabs financial statements 
for example  if a longer term were estimated genelabs revenue would be lower and the net loss would be higher 
conversely  if a shorter amortization term were estimated  genelabs revenue would be greater and the net loss lower 
we periodically assess the remaining term over which the up front payment from watson is being recognized into the statement of operations and will make changes based on updated information 
one of these changes occurred in  when we lengthened the amortization period based on fda s clarification of requirements for approval in the approvable letter  and subsequently  we made additional changes during based on new information about the time required to enroll patients in the clinical trial 
we have assessed the remaining term over which the up front payment from watson is being recognized into the statement of operations  and believe it is the most appropriate term based on the facts known to us as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
however  actions taken by the fda  or other changes in circumstances  after the filing of this annual report on form k may either reduce or lengthen the remaining period over which genelabs records the up front revenue from watson 
discontinued operations 
we account for our diagnostics subsidiary  genelabs diagnostics pte 
ltd  referred to as gld  as a discontinued operation because we are selling this business 
accounting treatment for discontinued operations involves segregation of the net assets and operating results of the discontinued operation for separate disclosure in the financial statements  rather than including the results within the other line items of the financial statements 
we have accounted for gld as a discontinued operation since  the year we adopted a plan to divest gld 
we have determined that gld meets held for sale criteria of current accounting requirements as of december   and that discontinued operation accounting continues to apply 
judgments and estimates were used in reaching this conclusion 
a different interpretation of current accounting literature that concluded discontinued operation accounting did not apply would have a significant impact on the financial statements  increasing revenues  operating expenses  assets and liabilities  although shareholders equity and the net loss would remain the same 
in march we entered into an agreement to sell gld and its immediate parent corporation  genelabs asia pte 
ltd  subject to certain closing conditions 
results of operations years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  an increase of million from the million net loss in this increase in net loss is primarily the result of higher research and development costs during  related to the confirmatory clinical trial we are conducting in women with lupus and also due to incentive bonus costs that were incurred as a result of the liquidity provided by financings 
table of contents closed by genelabs during the year 
partially offsetting these increases were lower salary and benefit costs resulting from a reduction in workforce implemented in early a more detailed discussion of the changes in genelabs statement of operations follows 
contract revenue 
contract revenues were million in  a decrease of million from million in contract revenues in the following table breaks down contract revenue by major source watson royalties and license fees data analysis services total contract revenue in  approximately of revenue was the recognition into income of a previously received up front license payment from watson 
in  this source of revenue decreased due to a revision we made to the estimate of time it would take us to obtain an answer from the fda on approval of prestara after we submit a complete response to the approvable letter 
the period of time to receive an answer from the fda is the period over which we have significant obligation to watson and are amortizing the deferred revenue 
genelabs currently estimates that it will take until june for an fda decision on the nda 
accordingly  during the third and fourth quarters of  genelabs extended the amortization period of the up front payment received from watson from a period ending december  to a period ending june  if this change were applied over a full year  this change would reduce annual revenue by approximately million from the rate used at the end of this amount is less than the decrease in the contract revenue recognized from watson for compared to because during a separate adjustment was made to the amortization period upon the fda s issuance of the approvable letter  which clarified the obligations of genelabs under its agreement with watson 
aside from the revenue recognized from watson  other sources of revenue include data analysis services performed for larger pharmaceutical companies  royalties and license fees 
collectively  these other sources aggregated approximately million in both and operating expenses 
the following table breaks down operating expenses into the two major categories of costs on our financial statements 
change research and development general and administrative total operating expenses all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
the two key increases in operating expenses for compared to were costs related to conducting our confirmatory clinical trial of prestara for lupus and costs incurred for our employees incentive bonuses 
these are each explained in more detail below 
research and development expenses background because we are in the business of drug discovery and development and have not developed any products that have been approved for sale  the majority of our costs are classified as research and development and are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include related salaries and benefits  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract and outside service fees  supplies and chemicals used in laboratories and allocated facilities and overhead costs 
over the last ten years  the majority of genelabs research and development has been directed toward two major projects developing prestara tm as an investigational new drug for lupus and discovery of entirely new drugs  both of which are on going 

table of contents research and development expenses by project in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  an increase of million for as compared to the following table breaks down the research and development expenses by major project in thousands change drug development prestara tm drug discovery hcv and dna binding support costs and other r d total research and development drug development prestara tm costs for prestara increased to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of our confirmatory phase iii clinical trial  which enrolled patients throughout in addition  genelabs also incurred additional incremental costs in for qualification of a manufacturing site for prestara 
genelabs began developing prestara tm for systemic lupus erythematosus in when genelabs licensed exclusive rights to patents related to prestara from stanford university 
to develop this drug candidate  we have built internal clinical development capabilities including clinical trial design  monitoring  analysis and reporting  regulatory affairs and quality control and assurance 
direct costs incurred to build these capabilities and advance prestara through clinical trials to its current approvable status with the fda have been approximately million through december  if the clinical trial results  currently expected in the fourth quarter of  are positive and the fda approves prestara for lupus  genelabs expects to continue work on this project  seeking approval in other countries and investigating other indications and potential uses of the investigational drug 
if the clinical trial results are not positive and the fda does not approve prestara for lupus  genelabs plans to evaluate the results and the requirements for approval prior to making a decision on further development 
as these results are not expected to be available until the fourth quarter of  we do not expect the clinical trial results will significantly impact our costs for  which are expected to increase approximately to in we expect to incur additional costs after  but these will be dependent on the clinical trial results and future decisions from the fda and regulatory authorities in europe and other countries 
major collaborations for prestara are with watson pharmaceuticals  inc in north america and with tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
in japan 
drug discovery costs for our drug discovery program decreased to million in from million in drug discovery costs were lower in compared to because of a reduction in the drug discovery workforce that was implemented in early genelabs current drug discovery efforts have evolved from a program that initially focused on dna as a target for drug intervention 
since initiating this drug discovery program  genelabs has built medicinal chemistry  combinatorial chemistry  computational modeling  molecular biology  assay development and high throughput screening  drug metabolism  pharmacokinetics and toxicology capabilities 
genelabs has incurred direct drug discovery costs for these efforts from the inception of our dna binding program in through december  of approximately million 
our drug discovery efforts have generated lead compounds for fungal  bacterial and viral infections 
in addition  these efforts have generated a preclinical candidate for aspergillus  an often fatal systemic fungal infection  and we have initiated preclinical studies in our hepatitis c virus research program 
our drug discovery efforts are presently concentrated on identifying a new drug to combat infection with hcv  which includes the further testing of our preclinical 
table of contents drug candidates and other lead compounds  as well as identification of additional potential lead compounds 
the following table breaks down the percentage of direct drug discovery costs by major project hepatitis c virus dna binding total direct drug discovery costs due to the nature of drug discovery research  we cannot reliably estimate the outcome of scientific experiments  many of which will impact the design and conduct of subsequent scientific experiments  and all of which provide additional information on both the direction of the research program and likelihood of its success 
as such  the potential timing for key future events that may occur in our drug discovery programs cannot reliably be estimated and we cannot estimate whether a compound will advance to a later stage of development or when we may determine that a program is no longer viable for potentially producing a drug candidate 
we also cannot reasonably predict the costs to reach these stages  and cannot predict whether any of our compounds will result in commercial products or lead to revenue for the company 
however  we presently estimate that drug discovery costs for will be approximately greater than  although the outcome of our corporate partnering discussions and current scientific experiments may result in significant changes to this estimate 
management continually evaluates the status of our drug discovery research programs and expects to continue to devote resources toward our hepatitis c drug discovery program  while at the same time managing the level of expenditures to balance advancement of potential product candidates against genelabs limited cash resources and the cash requirements for development of prestara 
support costs and other r d support costs and other r d is primarily comprised of costs necessary to maintain a research and development facility  such as rent  support staff  maintenance and utilities  and the company bonus  all allocated based on the headcount ratio between research and development and general and administrative 
support costs and other r d were million in and million in  an increase of million 
the following table breaks down by percentage the major components of support costs and other r d employee bonus facility rent insurance and depreciation support staff utilities  maintenance and security other r d and related intellectual property costs total support and other r d costs the million increase in costs during was primarily due to approximately million related to bonuses for all employees incurred in as compared to no bonus charge in no bonus charge was incurred in due to liquidity issues 
in addition  we entered into a new facility lease at the end of  increasing the support and other r d costs by an additional million  although this did not significantly increase the percentage of support and other r d costs in compared to because the total was higher 
other costs included in support costs and other r d decreased in as compared to  both in total dollars and as a percentage of the total support and other r d costs  as a result of facility improvements becoming fully depreciated at the end of and our reduction in workforce 
in  we expect support costs and other r d to decrease approximately  primarily because we expect the bonus charges to be lower 

table of contents general and administrative in  million in operating expenses were general and administrative expenses  compared to million in  an increase of million 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for executive management  finance  marketing  business development  human resources and legal departments  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and audit  and allocated facilities costs such as rent and insurance 
during  higher general and administrative costs were incurred due to accrual of bonuses in upon meeting board determined goals for our level of funding compared to no expense in meeting these goals increased general and administrative costs by million in compared to offsetting this increase were lower salary costs as a result of the reduction in workforce implemented in early future general and administrative expenses will vary depending upon our execution of our business plans  although management currently expects general and administrative expenses to be within approximately of the general and administrative expenses 
nonoperating expenses 
interest income was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in interest income was due to lower average cash and short term investment balances during than during in  we recorded million in income from the discontinued operations of genelabs diagnostics pte 
ltd  an increase of million from million in income for the increase in income from discontinued operations was primarily due to higher sales of diagnostics products 
years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  an increase of million from the million net loss in this increase is primarily the result of lower contract revenue and interest income in a more detailed discussion of the changes in genelabs statement of operations follows 
contract revenue 
contract revenues were million in  a decrease of million from million in contract revenues in in  approximately of revenue  or million  was the recognition of a previously received up front license payment from watson 
in  this source of revenue decreased by million from the million recorded as revenue from watson in due to the fda s clarification in the august approvable letter of the period over which we have significant obligation to watson 
based on this clarification  beginning in the third quarter of  genelabs extended the amortization period of the up front payment received from watson to a period ending december  this change reduced revenue by million  as it was implemented beginning in the third quarter 
if this change were applied over a full year  it would have reduced annual revenue by approximately million 
aside from the revenue recognized from watson  none of our other sources of revenue for exceeded million 
other sources of revenue include data analysis services performed for larger pharmaceutical companies  royalties and grants 
collectively  these other sources declined by million in compared to one component of this decrease was the scheduled expiration of genelabs defense advanced research projects agency darpa grant at the end of january  resulting in a decrease in contract revenue of million in compared to in addition  revenues from data analysis services performed for pharmaceutical companies also decreased by million 
partially offsetting these decreases  in genelabs recognized million in revenue from the license of dna amplification technologies to a leading genetic analysis tool company 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million in  an increase of million from the million in operating expenses in all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  an increase of million for as compared to costs related to prestara were approximately million higher in due to our frequent meetings with the fda and initiation of a confirmatory phase iii clinical trial for prestara for lupus 
costs for genelabs drug discovery efforts increased by million in compared to  as we built 
table of contents additional discovery research capabilities in chemistry and pharmacokinetics while initiating a new project directed towards discovery of a new treatment for infection with the hepatitis c virus 
in  million in operating expenses were general and administrative expenses  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
lower general and administrative costs were incurred in compared to as a result of the resolution of a legal matter in  the costs of which included legal fees and payments to the other party of approximately million 
the balance of the savings  million  was due to overall cost savings measures implemented in the majority of administrative areas 
nonoperating expenses 
interest income was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and lower average cash and short term investment balances during than during in  we recorded million in income from the discontinued operations of genelabs diagnostics pte 
ltd  a decrease from million in income for primarily due to lower sales of diagnostics products 
liquidity and capital resources genelabs had cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances totaling million at december  during  our cash and short term investments balance increased by million  largely due to million  net  raised from the sale of common stock  partially offset by million cash used in operations 
the cash used in operations funded our development of prestara for lupus and the continued research on the discovery of a new treatment for hepatitis c virus infection 
on march   after giving effect to million received upon execution of the collaboration and license agreement with tanabe seiyaku  genelabs had cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances totaling approximately million 
genelabs estimates that our current cash resources are adequate to provide liquidity into however  we will require additional capital to carry out our business plans in and expect to continue to rely on outside sources of financing to meet our capital needs 
the company is pursuing the sale of its diagnostics operation and also negotiating licenses for the european rights to prestara  which  if completed  we expect would provide additional cash resources to genelabs 
genelabs is also evaluating the sale of non core assets and exploring other potential partnerships as sources of funding 
the company may be unable to complete any of these transactions as currently contemplated or at all 
in addition  the results of our clinical trial measuring the effect of prestara on bone mineral density of women with lupus will have a material impact on our ability to secure funding and the amount and terms of funding that may be available 
longer term  genelabs liquidity and capital resources will be materially impacted by fda actions with respect to our nda for prestara 
if prestara is approved for marketing in the us  genelabs may receive a one time milestone payment of up to million from watson 
receipt of a milestone payment from watson would materially improve genelabs liquidity and capital resources 
however  genelabs believes that the most important impact of the watson collaboration for genelabs long term liquidity and capital resources is the significant royalties genelabs is entitled to receive on net sales of prestara 
during the first three quarters after product launch  a separate royalty schedule applies to support the product launch 
since genelabs inception  the company has operated at a loss and has funded operations primarily through public and private offerings of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  contract revenues 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including research costs for drug discovery and development costs for prestara 
the amount of additional costs in our business plans will depend on numerous factors including any fda actions  progress of our research and development programs and the status of corporate partnership agreements 
additional funds for our research and development activities may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the unavailability of additional funds could delay or prevent the development  approval or marketing of some or all of our products and technologies  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents other contractual arrangements 
genelabs principal research  clinical development and office facilities are leased from third parties under operating leases 
as such  genelabs expenses its facility rental costs as those costs are incurred over the term of the lease 
other than the facility operating leases  genelabs does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
there are no contractual financial obligations that extend beyond the next five years  although we have an option to extend our current operating lease for a four year period beyond its current expiration in november our contractual obligations for the next five years are as follows less than one to three to one year three years five years total in thousands operating leases equipment loans total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk genelabs exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term investments 
we consider the risk minimal as each security in our portfolio of short term investments matures in less than two years  to date we have not used derivative instruments  and we have placed our investments with high quality debt issuers 
as of december   the overall average maturity of genelabs short term investment portfolio was less than six months  as all of genelabs short term investments were in a money market fund  leaving little exposure to changes in interest rates 
genelabs exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company s investment in a taiwan based biopharmaceutical company  genovate biotechnology co  ltd  which is accounted for at cost  based on the lower of cost or market value method 
this investment is the only item included in the balance sheet caption long term investments 
genelabs may attempt to divest a portion of this investment  in which case changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the proceeds received upon sale of these shares 
because the book value of genelabs ownership percentage of genovate is greater than our carrying cost  we currently do not believe that any foreign currency exchange rate changes would impact the value of this investment as reported in the financial statements unless the value of a taiwan dollar depreciates by greater than compared to the us dollar  which  depending on other circumstances  might require genelabs to record a non cash charge to write down the long term investment
