overview 
we offer managed care and other health insurance products to employer groups and medicare beneficiaries in eight western states and guam 
our commercial and senior plans are designed to deliver quality health care and customer service to members cost effectively 
these programs include health maintenance organizations  or hmos  preferred provider organizations  or ppos  and medicare supplement products 
we also offer a variety of specialty managed care products and services that employees can purchase as a supplement to our basic commercial and senior medical plans or as stand alone products 
these products include pharmacy benefit management  or pbm  services  behavioral health services  group life and health insurance  dental and vision benefit plans 
premium revenues are earned from products where we bear insured risk 
non premium revenues are earned from all other sources  including revenues from our pbm mail order business  administrative fees and other income 
commencing with the first quarter of  we reformatted our statement of operations to show total revenues premium revenues and non premium revenues and health care services and other expenses by the following categories commercial  senior and specialty and other 
these changes are summarized below for our behavioral health and dental and vision subsidiaries  we previously included premium revenues in the commercial revenue line and non premium revenues in the other income line 
in  all revenues premium and non premium derived from our specialty companies behavioral health  dental and vision and pbm are now reported in the specialty and other revenues line 
all health care services and other expenses for our specialty companies were previously included within commercial health care costs 
in  all health care services and other expenses for our specialty companies are now reported in the specialty and other health care services and other expenses line 
non premium revenues earned by  and non premium related fees charged by  our health plans or subsidiaries were previously included in the other income line 
in  these amounts are now included in the commercial  senior or specialty revenue and health care services and other expenses lines  as appropriate 
all intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents revenue commercial and senior 
our commercial and senior revenues include all premium revenue we receive from our health plans  indemnity insurance subsidiary and medicare supplement and senior supplement products  as well as fee revenue we receive from administrative services we offer through our commercial and senior health plans and related subsidiaries 
we receive a monthly payment on behalf of each subscriber enrolled in our commercial hmos and our indemnity insurance service plans 
generally  our medicare choice contracts entitle us to per member per month payments from the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  on behalf of each enrolled medicare beneficiary 
we report prepaid health care premiums received from our commercial plans enrolled groups  cms  and our medicare plans members as revenue in the month that members are entitled to receive health care 
we record premiums received in advance as unearned premium revenue 
premiums for our commercial products and medicare choice products are generally fixed in advance of the periods covered 
of our commercial business  more than of our membership renews on january of each year  with premiums that are generally fixed for a period of one year 
in addition  each of our subsidiaries that offers medicare choice products must submit adjusted community rate proposals  generally by county or service area  to cms  in early september for each medicare choice product that will be offered in the subsequent year 
as a result  increases in the costs of health care services in excess of the estimated future health care services expense reflected in the premiums or the adjusted community rate proposals generally cannot be recovered in the applicable contract year through higher premiums or changes in benefit designs 
specialty and other 
our specialty and other revenues include all premium revenues we receive from our behavioral health and dental and vision service plans and fee revenue we receive from administrative services we offer though our specialty companies  primarily from our pbm subsidiary 
our pbm subsidiary generates mail order revenue where we  rather than network retail pharmacies  collect the member copayments for both affiliated and unaffiliated members 
additionally  we record revenues for prescription drug costs and administrative fees charged on prescriptions dispensed by our mail order pharmacy when the prescription is filled 
for prescription drugs dispensed through retail pharmacies  we record administrative services fees when a prescription claim is reviewed and approved  and the prescription is filled 
for prescription drugs dispensed through retail pharmacies  we do not record revenues for drugs dispensed or the network pharmacies dispensing fees  nor do we record revenues for copayments our members make to the retail pharmacies 
net investment income 
net investment income consists of interest income  gross realized gains and losses experienced on cash invested over each period 
expenses commercial and senior health care services and other 
health care services and other expenses for our commercial plans and our senior plans primarily comprise payments to physicians  hospitals and other health care providers under capitated or risk based contracts for services provided to our commercial and senior health plan members and indemnity insurance plan members 
our risk based health care services expenses consist mostly of four cost of care components outpatient care  inpatient care  professional services primarily physician care and pharmacy benefit costs 
all four components are affected by both unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs  for example  are the cost of outpatient medical procedures  inpatient hospital stays  physician fees for office visits and prescription drug prices 
utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and vary with the age and health of our members and broader social and lifestyle patterns of the population as a whole 

table of contents the cost of health care provided is accrued in the month services are provided to members  based in part on estimates of claims for hospital services and other health care costs that have been incurred but not yet reported including those claims received but not yet paid  or ibnr  under our risk based provider contracts as well as some services under our capitation contracts for which we retain financial liability  or carve outs  primarily using standard actuarial methodologies based on historical data 
these standard actuarial methodologies include  among other factors  contractual requirements  historical utilization trends  the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  benefit changes  expected health care cost inflation  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
these estimates are adjusted in future periods as we receive actual paid claims data  and can either increase or reduce our accrued health care costs 
included in health care services and other expenses for the year ended december  were net favorable adjustments of and prior period medical cost estimates of approximately million of which the commercial and senior net favorable adjustments were million and million  respectively 
for both commercial and senior  the net favorable adjustments were mainly from our texas and california markets and were the result of lower than anticipated health care costs that materialized primarily in senior markets that we exited and recoveries of claims overpayments at rates higher than historic recovery patterns 
the cost of prescription drugs covered under our commercial and senior plans is expensed when the prescription drugs are dispensed 
our commercial and senior plans also provide incentives  through a variety of programs  for health care providers that participate in those plans to control health care costs while providing quality health care 
expenses related to these programs  which are based in part on estimates  are recorded in the period in which the related services are provided 
historically  we have primarily arranged health care services for our members by contracting with health care providers on a capitated basis  regardless of the services provided to each member 
under our risk based contracts  we generally bear or partially share the risk of excess health care expenses with health care providers  meaning that if member utilization of health care services exceeds agreed upon amounts  we bear or partially share the excess expenses with the applicable health care provider 
specialty and other health care services and other 
health care services and other expenses for our specialty companies primarily comprise payments to physicians  hospitals and other health care providers under capitated or risk based contracts for services provided to our behavioral health and dental and vision members and the cost of acquiring drugs for our mail order pharmacy benefit management subsidiary 
health care services and other expenses also include expenses for administrative services performed by our specialty companies

the increase was primarily due to increased mail order revenues and unaffiliated membership from our pharmacy benefit management subsidiary 
net investment income 
net investment income increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following write off of a decline in the value of our investment in medunite  inc of million during  with no comparable activity in  write down of certain telecommunication investments to market value resulting in a charge of approximately million during  with no comparable activity in  partially offset by lower pre tax rates of return due to federal reserve rate reductions in commercial margin

specialty and other margin 
our specialty and other margin decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily driven by the loss of higher margin business  partially offset by an increase in unaffiliated membership in our behavioral health and pbm businesses 
medical loss ratio 
our medical loss ratios  or mlrs  are calculated using premium revenue and related health care services and other expenses and cannot be directly calculated from the line items in the consolidated statement of operations 
our mlrs are calculated using the following categories of revenue and expenses private commercial includes premium revenue and related health care services and other expenses for our commercial hmo products including federal employees health benefit program  or fehbp  and state and local government contracts  ppo products  and other indemnity  behavioral  dental and vision plans  private senior includes premium revenue and related health care services and other expenses for our medicare supplement and senior supplement products where premiums are paid in full by the employer or the consumer  government senior includes premium revenue and related health care services and other expenses for our medicare choice  hmo and ppo products and other senior products where premiums are paid principally through government programs 
all non premium revenues and related health care services and other expenses are excluded from the calculation of our mlr 
in  we calculated our mlr for our commercial and senior products based on total premiums and total health care services expenses as reported on our statement of operations 
this resulted in the inclusion of certain health care costs related to the cost of acquiring drugs for our mail order business of our pbm subsidiary within our commercial mlr calculation for which there was no corresponding revenues the related revenues were included in the other income line 
since this inadvertently had the effect of slightly increasing the mlr of our commercial product  we changed this presentation in order to provide more transparency on the trends affecting the profitability of our insured products 
under our new format  only premium revenues and the related health care and other services expenses are included in the mlr calculations 
the mlr calculations have been recalculated to conform to the presentation

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to billion for the year ended december   from billion in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased spending for new product development and marketing costs  our expensing of stock based compensation and increased write off of certain property and equipment

the effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   compared with in the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to higher earnings resulting in a higher state tax expense while reducing the benefit that tax exempt income had on our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate is based on statutory tax rates  reported income  certain permanent tax differences  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we may establish reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not fully prevail in overcoming these challenges 
we may adjust these reserves as relevant circumstances evolve  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the usual or one time item

prior to september   some of our domestic  unregulated subsidiaries were restricted from guaranteeing the senior notes by the terms of the fhp senior notes 
as the fhp senior notes were repaid in full on september   these subsidiaries now fully and unconditionally guarantee the senior notes 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap on million of our senior notes for the purpose of hedging the fair value of our indebtedness 
this fair value hedge is accounted for using the short cut method under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  whereby the hedge is reported in our balance sheets at fair value  and the carrying value of the long term debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
under the terms of the agreement  we make interest payments based on the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points and receive interest payments based on the fixed rate 
our rate under the swap agreement was  at december  which is based on a day libor of plus basis points 
the three month libor rate we use to determine our interest payments under the swap agreement was first established on june  and resets every three months thereafter  until expiration in june in june  we replaced our senior credit facility with a new syndicated facility with jpmorgan chase bank serving as the administrative agent 
the new facility consists of a million term loan  which matures on june   and a million revolving line of credit  which matures on june  we used the proceeds from the term loan to repay the million outstanding under the prior facility 
the remaining million was used to pay fees and expenses relating to the new facility and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had million outstanding on the term loan and no balance outstanding on the revolving line of credit 
we borrowed and repaid million under the revolving line of credit during the year ended december  on december   our senior credit facility was amended to provide for reduced interest rates per annum applicable to term loan borrowings  with the amount of margin spread for the borrowing being determined by our current debt ratings 
the amended applicable rates are  at our option  either jpmorgan chase bank s prime rate or  if greater  the federal funds rate plus which we refer to as the alternative base rate  plus a margin spread of to per annum  or the libor for the applicable interest period  plus a margin spread of to per annum 
all of our borrowings under the term loan are currently libor borrowings  and the current margin spread on our term loan borrowings is 
as of december   our term loan rate was per annum  which is based on a day libor of plus the applicable margin spread of 
the interest rates per annum under the senior credit facility applicable to revolving credit borrowings are  at our option  either the alternate base rate plus a margin spread of between to per annum  or the libor for the applicable interest period plus a margin spread of between to per annum  with the amount of the margin for any borrowing being determined based on current credit ratings for the debt under the senior credit facility 
our current margins for revolving credit borrowings are per annum for alternate base rate borrowings and per annum for libor borrowings 
the terms of the senior credit facility contain various covenants customary for financings of this type which place restrictions on our and or our subsidiaries ability to incur debt  pay dividends  create liens  make investments  optionally repay  redeem or repurchase our securities  and enter into 
table of contents mergers  dispositions and transactions with affiliates 
the senior credit facility also requires us to meet various financial ratios  including a minimum net worth requirement  a minimum fixed charge coverage requirement and a maximum leverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of our domestic  unregulated subsidiaries provide guarantees and have granted security interests to the lenders in substantially all of their personal property in order to secure our obligations under the senior credit facility 
we have also pledged the equity of certain of our subsidiaries to the lenders 
prior to september   some of our domestic  unregulated subsidiaries were restricted from guaranteeing the senior credit facility by the terms of the fhp senior notes 
as the fhp senior notes were repaid in full on september   these subsidiaries now fully and unconditionally guarantee the senior credit facility

purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
this includes contracts which are cancelable with notice and the payment of an early termination penalty 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also exclude liabilities to the extent presented on the balance sheet as of december  we are subject to various contracts with certain health care providers and facilities for the provision of health care services to its members 
such contracts involve payments from us  generally on a monthly basis  in the ordinary course of business and are not included in the above table because we are not required to make minimum payments under these contracts 
interest on long term debt is calculated using the stated rates per the financing agreements 
for debt with variable rates  such as the swap on million of our senior notes and the senior term loan  the rate in place as of december  was used to estimate all remaining payments 

table of contents as of december  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are required to be disclosed under item a ii of sec regulation s k 
in february  our debt was rated below investment grade by the major credit rating agencies as follows senior convertible credit senior subordinated agency outlook facility notes debentures moody s positive ba b b standard poor s stable bb bb b fitch ibca positive bb bb b consequently  if we seek to raise funds in capital markets transactions  our ability to do so will be limited to issuing additional non investment grade debt or issuing equity and or equity linked instruments 
we expect to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures during the next twelve months from our cash flow from operations or from capital market transactions 
we have taken a number of steps to increase our internally generated cash flow  including increasing premiums  increasing our marketing of specialty product lines  introducing new products to generate new revenue sources and reducing our health care expenses by  among other things  exiting from unprofitable markets and cost savings initiatives 
if our cash flow is less than we expect due to one or more of the risk factors described in cautionary statements  or our cash flow requirements increase for reasons we do not currently foresee or we make any acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  then we may need to draw down available funds on our revolving line of credit which matures in june or issue additional debt or equity securities 
a failure to comply with any covenant in the senior credit facility could make funds under our revolving line of credit unavailable 
we also may be required to take additional actions to reduce our cash flow requirements  including the deferral of planned investments aimed at reducing our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the deferral or cancellation of any investments could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet our short term business objectives 
we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and commitments  and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes either through additional debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise as appropriate 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission under which we may sell common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  debt securities  warrants  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units in one or more offerings from time to time up to a total dollar amount of million 
as of december   we have approximately million available under the shelf registration after our common stock offering in november the actual amount of any securities issued  the terms of those securities and the intended use of the proceeds from any sale  will be determined at the time of sale  if any such sale occurs 
other balance sheet change explanations receivables  net 
receivables  net as of december   decreased million from december  due to the decrease in provider receivables from collections and settlements primarily in california and washington 
medical claims and benefits payable 
the majority of our medical claims and benefits payable represents liabilities related to our risk based contracts 
under risk based contracts  claims are payable once incurred and cash disbursements are made to health care providers for services provided to members after the related claim has been submitted and adjudicated 
under capitated contracts  health care providers are prepaid on a fixed fee per member per month basis  regardless of the 
table of contents services provided to members 
the liabilities that arise for capitated contracts relate to timing issues primarily due to membership changes that may occur 
as of december   approximately of medical claims and benefits payable was attributable to risk based contracts 
the following table presents the breakdown of our medical claims and benefits payable december  december  amounts in millions incurred but not reported ibnr capitation and all other medical claims and benefits payable medical claims and benefits payable medical claims and benefits payable as of december  decreased million from the balance as of december   primarily due to a million reduction in capitation and all other medical claims and benefits payable due primarily to annual settlements of provider risk sharing programs through payouts or by offsetting of risk program receivables against risk program liabilities 
ibnr increased million as a result of an increase in commercial risk membership and commercial health care costs per member  partially offset by a decrease in the elapsed time between the date health care services were provided and payment of the related claims liabilities as compared to december  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities  including accrued compensation and employee benefits  increased million from december   primarily due to an increase of million related to increases in liabilities for reinsurance and legal expenses and the timing of payments of trade accounts payable and other accruals  an increase of million in accrued compensation and an increase of million in accrued taxes  partially offset by a decrease of million in opm reserves 
stockholders equity 
the decrease in treasury stock and additional paid in capital from december  were primarily due to the retirement of all million shares of outstanding treasury stock  partially offset by the issuance of million shares in connection with the public common stock offering and million shares of restricted common stock that we granted as part of an employee recognition and retention program during the year ended december  all share data have been adjusted for the effect of the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was effective january  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
adoption of new accounting policy stock based compensation for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million  net of tax  of compensation expense related to stock based compensation for employees and directors related to stock options and shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
prior to  we accounted for our stock based employee and director compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
stock based employee and director compensation cost was not reflected in the net loss for the year ended december   because all options granted under our plans had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  on a prospective basis for all employee and director awards granted  modified  or settled after january  awards to employees typically vest over four years 
therefore  the cost related to stock based employee and director compensation included in the determination of net income for is less than that which would have been recognized if the 
table of contents fair value based method had been applied to all awards granted  modified or settled since october  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
the accounting estimates that we believe involve the most complex judgments  and are the most critical to the accurate reporting of our financial condition and results of operations include the following incurred but not reported or paid claims reserves 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims incurred but not reported including those received but not yet paid  or ibnr  under our risk based provider contracts and our fee for service carve outs from our capitated provider contracts  primarily using standard actuarial methodologies based on historical data 
these standard actuarial methodologies include  among other factors  contractual requirements  historical utilization trends  the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  benefit changes  expected health care cost inflation  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
in developing the ibnr estimate  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for example  we actuarially calculate completion factors using our analysis of claims payment patterns over the most recent month period 
the completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that has been adjudicated by us as of the date of estimation 
we then apply these completion factors to the actual claims paid to date for each incurral month  except for the most recent months  to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for each of these months 
we do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent two to four months  because claims likely have not had enough time to achieve a trendable level of completion 
therefore  for the more recent months  we estimate our claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the per member per month pmpm costs for prior months  which costs have been estimated using completion factors  in order to estimate the pmpms for the most recent months 
we validate our estimates of the most recent pmpms by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in older months 
this approach is consistently applied from period to period 
the completion factors and claims pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our ibnr 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on the company s operating results caused by these factors completion factor a increase decrease in increase decrease in factor medical claims payable amounts in millions 
table of contents claims trend factor b increase decrease in increase decrease in factor medical claims payable amounts in millions a reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims payable caused by changes in completion factors in each of the most recent four months 
b reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month claims for the most recent four months 
in addition  assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimated claims liability and the actual claims incurred run out  net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  while diluted net income per share would increase or decrease by per share  net of tax  after adjusting for the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was effective january  the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr claims liabilities are made on an accrual basis and adjusted  based on actual claims data  in future periods as required 
adjustments to prior period estimates  if any  are included in the current period 
we also consider exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in establishing our best estimate  such as system conversions  processing interruptions  or environmental changes 
none of these factors had a material impact on the development of our claims payable estimates during any of the periods reflected in this filing 
for new products  such as our ppo products  estimates are initially based on health care cost data provided by third parties 
this data includes assumptions for member age  gender and geography 
the models that we use to prepare estimates for each product are adjusted to be in line with the approach discussed above as we accumulate actual claims data 
such estimates could materially understate or overstate our actual liability for medical claims and benefits payable 
provider insolvency reserves 
we maintain insolvency reserves for our capitated contracts with providers that include estimates for potentially insolvent providers  where conditions indicate claims are not being paid or have slowed considerably  and we have determined that it is probable that we will be required to make the providers claim payments 
these insolvency reserves include the estimated cost of unpaid health care claims that were previously the responsibility of the capitated provider 
depending on states laws  we may be held liable for unpaid health care claims that were previously the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid capitation 
these estimates could materially understate or overstate our actual liability for medical claims and benefits payable 
ordinary course legal proceedings 
from time to time  we are involved in legal proceedings that involve claims for coverage and tort liability encountered in the ordinary course of business 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it results in a significant punitive damage award  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our exposure to potential liability under punitive damage theories may significantly decrease our ability to settle these claims on reasonable terms 

table of contents cautionary statements in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company in this report or otherwise  within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements relate to future events or our future financial and or operating performance and can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as may  will  intends  plans  believes  anticipates  expects  estimates  predicts  potential  continue  or opportunity  the negative of these words or words of similar import 
similarly  statements that describe our reserves and our future plans  strategies  intentions  expectations  objectives  goals or prospects are also forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our expectations and projections about future events and future trends affecting our business  and so are subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties set forth below  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this report 
in addition  past financial and or operating performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance and you should not use our historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider the risks described below and in other parts of this report 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report 
risks relating to us and our industry our profitability will depend in part on accurately pricing our products and predicting health care costs and on our ability to control future health care costs 
our profitability depends in part on our ability to price our products accurately  predict our health care costs and control future health care costs through underwriting criteria  medical and disease management programs  product design and negotiation of favorable provider and hospital contracts 
we use our underwriting systems to establish and assess premium rates based on accumulated actuarial data  with adjustments for factors such as claims experience and hospital and physician contract changes 
we may be less able to accurately price our new products than our other products because of our relative lack of experience and accumulated data for our new products 
premiums on our commercial products are generally fixed for one year periods 
each of our subsidiaries that offers medicare choice products must submit adjusted community rate proposals  generally by county or service area  to cms in early september for each medicare choice product that will be offered in a subsequent year 
as a result  increases in the costs of health care services in excess of the estimated future health care costs reflected in the premiums or the adjusted community rate proposals generally cannot be recovered in the applicable contract year through higher premiums or benefit designs 
our actual health care costs may exceed our estimates reflected in premiums and adjusted community rates due to various factors  including increased utilization of medical facilities and services  including prescription drugs  changes in demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  changes in health care practices  medical cost inflation  new treatment and technologies  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  termination of capitation arrangements resulting in transfer of membership to risk based arrangements and contractual disputes with providers 
our failure to adequately price our products or predict and control health care costs may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents if we fail to implement successfully our strategic initiatives  our revenues could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our performance depends in part upon our ability to implement our business strategy of expanding our product portfolio and increasing our commercial and specialty memberships  managing our participation in the medicare choice program in light of the new medicare legislation and growth opportunity  and ultimately evolving into a consumer health organization 
in and  we experienced a decline in revenue from our reduced participation in medicare choice and a loss of unprofitable commercial membership 
we are seeking to replace revenue and increase our commercial business through a number of new product initiatives 
our revenues could decline if we lose membership  fail to increase membership in targeted markets or fail to gain market acceptance for new products for any reason  including the effect of premium increases  benefit changes and member paid supplemental premiums and copayments on the retention of existing members and the enrollment of new members  the member s assessment of our benefits  quality of service  our ease of use and our network stability for members in comparison to competing health plans  reductions in work force by existing customers and or reductions in benefits purchased by existing customers  and negative publicity and news coverage about us or litigation or threats of litigation against us 
our operating results could be adversely affected if our actual health care claims exceed our reserves or our liability for unpaid claims of insolvent providers under capitation agreements exceeds our insolvency reserves 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for submitted claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr claims primarily using standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical data 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr claims liabilities are made on an accrual basis  are continually reviewed and are adjusted in current operations as required 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the reserves could materially understate or overstate our actual liability for claims and benefits payable 
any increases to these prior estimates could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 
our capitated providers could become insolvent and expose us to unanticipated expenses 
we maintain insolvency reserves that include estimates for potentially insolvent providers  where conditions indicate claims are not being paid or have slowed considerably 
depending on states laws  we may be held liable for unpaid health care claims that were previously the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid capitation 
we may also incur additional health care costs in the event of provider instability that causes us to replace a provider at less cost effective rates to continue providing health care services to our members 
to reduce insolvency risk  we have developed contingency plans that include shifting members to other providers and reviewing operational and financial plans to monitor and maximize financial and network stability 
as capitation contracts are renewed for providers we have also taken steps  where feasible  to have security reserves established for insolvency issues 
security reserves are most frequently in the forms of letters of credit or segregated funds that are held in the provider s name in a third party financial institution 
the reserves may be used to pay claims that are the financial responsibility of the provider 
these security reserves may not be adequate to cover claims that are the financial responsibility of the provider 

table of contents a disruption in our health care provider network could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products and our profitability 
our profitability is dependent in part upon our ability to contract with health care providers on favorable terms 
in any particular market  health care providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs or our difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  health care providers may have significant market positions or may be the only available health care provider 
if health care providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts  or place us at a competitive disadvantage  then our ability to market products or to be profitable in those markets could be adversely affected 
our provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of large provider groups 
any disruption in our provider network could result in a loss of membership or higher health care costs 
we may be exposed to liability or fail to estimate ibnr accurately if we cannot process our increased volume of claims accurately and timely 
we have regulatory risk for the timely processing and payment of claims 
if we  or any entities with whom we subcontract to process or pay claims  are unable to handle continued increased claims volume  or if we are unable to pay claims timely we may be subject to regulatory censure and penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 
in addition  if our claims processing system is unable to process claims accurately  the data we use for our ibnr estimates could be incomplete and our ability to estimate claims liabilities and establish adequate reserves could be adversely affected 
our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately control our prescription drug costs 
overall  prescription drug costs have been rising for the past few years 
the increases are due to the introduction of new drugs that treat new conditions or have fewer side effects  new medications costing significantly more than existing drugs  direct consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry creating consumer demand for particular brand drugs  patients seeking medications to address lifestyle changes  higher prescribed doses of medications and enhanced pharmacy benefits for members such as reduced copayments and higher benefit maximums 
we may be unable to predict these costs when establishing our premiums or completely manage these costs  which could adversely impact our profitability 
increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses could harm our profitability 
our selling  general and administrative expenses have been rising due in part to our continued investment in strategic initiatives and could increase more than we anticipate as a result of a number of factors  which could adversely impact our profitability 
these factors include our need for additional investments in pbm expansion  branding and advertising campaigns  medical management  underwriting and actuarial resources and technology  our need for additional investments in information technology projects  including consolidation of our existing systems that manage membership  eligibility  capitation  claims processing and payment information and other important information  our need for increased claims administration  personnel and systems  our greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products  which may result in an increase in the broker commissions we pay  
table of contents the necessity to comply with regulatory requirements  the success or lack of success of our marketing and sales plans to attract new customers  and create customer acceptance for new products  our ability to estimate costs for our self insured retention for medical malpractice claims  and our ability to estimate legal expenses and settlements associated with litigation that has been or could be brought against us 
in addition  our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our revenue could increase due to changes in our product mix among commercial  senior and specialty products and unexpected declines in our membership and related revenue 
if we do not generate expected cash flow from operations  we could be forced to postpone or cancel some of these planned investments  which would adversely affect our ability to meet our short term strategic plan 
the inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs could result in operational disruptions and other adverse consequences 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in among other things  marketing and sales tracking  underwriting  billing  claims processing  capitation processing  medical management  medical cost and utilization trending  financial and management accounting  reporting  planning and analysis and e commerce 
these systems also support our on line customer service functions  provider and member administrative functions and support our tracking and extensive analyses of health care costs and outcome data 
any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences 
we are subject to class action lawsuits that could result in material liabilities to us or cause us to incur material costs  to change our operating procedures or comply with increased regulatory requirements 
health care providers and members are currently attacking practices of the hmo industry through a number of lawsuits brought against us and other hmos  including in re managed care 
the class action lawsuits brought by health care providers allege that hmos claims processing systems automatically and impermissibly alter codes included on providers reimbursement claims forms to reduce the amount of reimbursement  and that hmos impose unfair contracting terms on health care providers  impermissibly delay making capitated payments under their capitated contracts  and negotiate capitation payments that are inadequate to cover the costs of health care services provided 
these lawsuits  including those filed to date against us  may take years to resolve and cause us to incur substantial litigation expenses 
depending upon the outcomes of these cases  these lawsuits may cause or force changes in practices of the hmo industry 
these cases also may cause additional regulation of the industry through new federal or state laws 
these actions and actions brought by state attorney generals ultimately could adversely affect the hmo industry and  whether due to damage awards  required changes to our operating procedures  increased regulatory requirements or otherwise  have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows and prospects 

table of contents we are subject to other litigation in the ordinary course of business that may result in material liabilities to us  including liabilities for which we may not be insured 
we are  in the ordinary course of business  subject to the claims of our members arising out of decisions to deny or restrict reimbursement for services  including medical malpractice claims related to our taking a more active role in managing the cost of medical care 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it results in a significant punitive damage award  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our exposure to potential liability under punitive damage theories may significantly decrease our ability to settle these claims on reasonable terms 
we maintain general liability  property  excess managed care errors and omissions and medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we are at risk for our self insured retention on these claims  and are substantially self insured for errors and omissions and medical malpractice claims through a combination of retention and through premiums we pay to a captive insurance carrier 
coverages typically include varying and increasing levels of self insured retention or deductibles that increase our risk of loss 
as a government contractor  we are exposed to risks that could materially affect our revenue or profitability from our medicare choice products or our willingness to participate in the medicare program 
the medicare program has accounted for of our total revenue in and more than of our total revenue in each of the prior five years 
cms regulates the benefits provided  premiums paid  quality assurance procedures  marketing and advertising for our medicare choice products 
cms may terminate our medicare choice contracts or elect not to renew those contracts when those contracts come up for renewal every months 
although we expect to receive increased government funding under the newly enacted dima legislation  we may still face the risk of reduced or insufficient government reimbursement and the need to continue to exit unprofitable markets 
the loss of medicare contracts or changes in the regulatory requirements governing the medicare choice program or the program itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we compete in highly competitive markets and our inability to compete effectively for any reason in any of those markets could adversely affect our profitability 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
consolidation of acute care hospitals and continuing consolidation of insurance carriers  other hmos  employer self funded programs and ppos  some of which have substantially larger enrollments or greater financial resources than ours  has created competition for hospitals  physicians and members  impacting profitability and the ability to influence medical management 
the cost of providing benefits is in many instances the controlling factor in obtaining and retaining employer groups as clients and some of our competitors have set premium rates at levels below our rates for comparable products 
we anticipate that premium pricing will continue to be highly competitive 
in addition  pbm companies have continued to consolidate  competing with our pbm  prescription solutions 
some pbms possess greater financial  marketing and other resources than we possess 
if we are unable to compete effectively in any of our markets  our business may be adversely affected 
our business activities are highly regulated and new and proposed government regulation or legislative reforms could increase our cost of doing business  reduce our membership or subject us to additional litigation 
our health plans are subject to substantial federal and state government regulations  including those relating to maintenance of minimum net worth or risk based capital  
table of contents licensing requirements  approval of policy language and benefits  mandated benefits and administrative processes  employment retirement income security act of  or erisa  claims and appeals review procedures for employer sponsored and self insured plans  provider compensation arrangements  member disclosure  periodic audits and investigations by state and federal agencies  restrictions on some investment activities  and restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments  loans  loan repayments or other payments to us 
the laws and regulations governing our business and interpretations of these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change 
in recent years  significant federal and state laws have been enacted that have increased our cost of doing business  exposed us to increased liability and had other adverse effects on our business 
state and federal governments are continually considering changes to the laws and regulations regulating our industry  and are currently considering laws and regulations relating to increasing minimum capital or risk based capital requirements  mandating benefits and products  restricting a health plan s ability to limit coverage to medically necessary care  reducing the reimbursement or payment levels for government funded programs  imposing guidelines for pharmaceutical manufacturers that would cause pharmaceutical companies to restructure the financial terms of their business arrangements with pbms  hmos or other health plans  patients bill of rights legislation at the state and federal level that would hold hmos liable for medical malpractice  limiting a health plan s ability to capitate physicians and hospitals or delegate financial risk  utilization review  quality assurance or other medical decisions to our contracting physicians and hospitals  restricting a health plan s ability to select and terminate providers in our networks  allowing independent physicians to collectively bargain with health plans on a number of issues  including financial compensation  adding further restrictions and administrative requirements on the use  retention  transmission  processing  protection and disclosure of personally identifiable health information  and tightening time periods for the timely payment and administration of health care claims and imposing financial and other penalties for non compliance 
all of these proposals could apply to us and could increase our health care costs  decrease our membership or otherwise adversely affect our revenue and our profitability 

table of contents our investment portfolio is subject to economic and market conditions as well as regulation that may adversely affect the performance of the portfolio 
the market value of our investments fluctuates depending upon economic and market conditions 
the investment income we earn has been negatively impacted by the lower interest rates prevailing in united states financial markets 
in periods of declining interest rates  bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments generally increase  resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at the then lower market rates 
our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolio and limit the amount of investments we can make in riskier investments that could generate higher returns 
in some cases  these laws could require the sale of investments in our portfolio 
we cannot be certain that our investment portfolio will produce total positive returns in future periods or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future  which could adversely affect our operations 
we have substantial indebtedness outstanding and have available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility of up to million 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our significant indebtedness poses risks to our business  including the risks that we could use a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing the funds available to fund our strategic initiatives and working capital requirements  insufficient cash flow from operations may force us to sell assets  or seek additional capital  which we may be unable to do at all or on terms favorable to us  our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns  and our debt service obligations increase our vulnerabilities to competitive pressures  because many of our competitors are less leveraged than we are 
our ability to repay debt depends in part on dividends and cash transfers from our subsidiaries 
nearly all of our subsidiaries are subject to hmo regulations or insurance regulations and may be subject to substantial supervision by one or more hmo or insurance regulators 
subsidiaries subject to regulation must meet or exceed various capital standards imposed by hmo or insurance regulations  which may from time to time impact the amount of funds the subsidiaries can pay to us 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us 
additionally  from time to time  we advance funds in the form of a loan or capital contribution to our subsidiaries to assist them in satisfying state financial requirements 
we may provide additional funding to a subsidiary if a state regulator imposes additional financial requirements due to concerns about the financial position of the subsidiary or if there is an adverse effect resulting from changes to the risk based capital requirements 
this may in turn affect the subsidiary s ability to pay state regulated dividends or make other cash transfers 
our senior credit facility and our senior notes contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategy 
our senior credit facility and our senior notes limit  and in some circumstances prohibit  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  effect a consolidation or merger and engage in other activities 

table of contents we are required under the senior credit facility to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
we may not be able to maintain these ratios 
covenants in the senior credit facility and our senior notes may impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these covenants and other provisions of the senior credit facility and our senior notes may be affected by our operating and financial performance  changes in business conditions or results of operations  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
in addition  if we do not comply with these covenants  the lenders under the senior credit facility and our senior notes may accelerate our debt repayment under the senior credit facility and our senior notes 
if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility or our senior notes is accelerated  we could not assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay all outstanding indebtedness in full 
the concentration of our commercial and government senior business in eight western states and guam subjects us to risks from economic downturns in this region 
we offer managed care and other health insurance products to employer groups and medicare beneficiaries primarily in eight western states and guam 
due to this concentration of business in a small number of states  we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of an economic downturn in these states and region of the country 
if economic conditions deteriorate in any of these states  particularly in california where we have our largest membership  our membership and our margins may decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
we could incur unexpected health care and other costs as a result of terrorism or natural disasters 
we cannot predict or prevent the occurrence of bioterrorism or other acts of terrorism or natural disasters  such as earthquakes  which could cause increased and unexpected utilization of health care services 
these events could also have adverse effects on general economic conditions in the states where we offer products  the price and availability of products and services we purchase  the availability and morale of our employees  our operations and facilities or the demand for our products 
we maintain disaster recovery plans intended to enable us to continue to operate without major disruptions in service following disasters 
however  a disaster could severely impair or delay service to our members  cause us to incur significant cost of recovery and cause a loss of members 
our pbm subsidiary  prescription solutions  faces regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry that differ from the risks of providing managed care and health insurance products 
our pbm is also subject to federal and state anti remuneration laws that govern its relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
federal and state legislatures are considering new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices  including the receipt of rebates from pharmaceutical companies 
in addition  if a court were to determine that our pbm acts as a fiduciary under erisa  we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies  preferred drug listings and therapeutic intervention programs and other transactions 
we also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy  which subjects us to extensive federal  state and local regulation  as well as risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
the failure to adhere to these regulations could expose our pbm subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 
we also face potential claims in connection with claimed errors by our mail order pharmacy 

table of contents our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based upon various assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties that may result in our failure to achieve our forecasted results 
from time to time in press releases  conference calls and otherwise  we may publish or make forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated earnings per share and other operating and financial metrics 
our forecasts are based upon various assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties and any number of them may prove incorrect 
our estimated earnings per share are based in part upon a forecast of our weighted average shares outstanding at the time of our estimate 
our convertible subordinated debentures include a contingent conversion feature that may materially affect our weighted average shares outstanding in any quarter 
if the conditions to conversion are satisfied during a quarter  then the debentures are convertible during the next quarter and the underlying shares of common stock into which they are convertible are included in the calculation of our weighted average shares outstanding 
if the conditions to conversion are not met  then the underlying shares are excluded from the calculation 
our achievement of any forecasts depends upon numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
consequently  we cannot assure you that our performance will be consistent with management forecasts 
variations from forecasts and other forward looking statements may be material and adverse 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of our asset liability management activities is to maximize net investment income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and facilitating our funding needs 
our net investment income and interest expense are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we manage the structure of the maturity of debt and investments and may use derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap on million of our senior notes for the purpose of hedging the fair value of our indebtedness 
this fair value hedge is accounted for using the short cut method under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  whereby the hedge is reported in our balance sheets at fair value  and the carrying value of the long term debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
under the terms of the agreement  we make interest payments based on the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points and receive interest payments based on the fixed rate 
the three month libor rate we use to determine our interest payments under the swap agreement was first established on june  and resets every three months thereafter  until expiration in june the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and for investment securities and debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for debt with variable rates  the rates in place as of december  are used to determine average interest rates 
additionally  we have assumed our marketable securities and restricted marketable securities  comprised primarily of us government  state  municipal  and corporate debt securities  are similar enough to aggregate into fixed rate and variable rate securities for presentation purposes 
for terms relating to our long term debt  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements
