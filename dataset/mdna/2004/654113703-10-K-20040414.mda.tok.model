critical accounting policies  methods and estimates note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to utilize accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results 
accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation and impairment of long lived assets  and estimate of restructuring reserves for vacated leased facilities 

table of contents the following is a brief discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods that we use 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue principally from licenses of our products  maintenance and support  and delivery of implementation services 
we offer our products primarily through our direct sales force 
we also offer our products indirectly through certain channel partners 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred and no significant obligations of ours with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier or electronically delivered to the customer 
if undelivered features or services exist in an arrangement that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenue is recognized when these features or services are delivered 
the fees for our products are generally due within six months or less 
the company considers fees relating to the arrangements with payment terms extending beyond six months not to be fixed or determinable and revenue for these arrangements is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with our credit review process  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
if there are sales to channel partners  they are recognized upon sell through to the end user customer 
for multiple element software arrangements  we defer the fair value of revenue associated with each undelivered element until such time as delivery occurs 
deferred revenue is allocated to each element using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
the vsoe for each element is established when the same element is sold separately to third parties 
vsoe for maintenance and support is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for this element 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the amount of the aged accounts receivable  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay  and our collection history with each customer 
we review any invoice greater than days past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage to aging categories based on historical loss experience 
assumptions and judgments regarding collectibility of accounts could differ from actual events 
as of january   the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
our allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total net revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
our allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net accounts receivable were  and in  and  respectively 
based on our results for  a one percentage point deviation in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total net accounts receivable would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of million 
impairment assessment we account for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets utilizing statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a 
table of contents comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
we do not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable 
restructuring reserves for vacated leased facilities we have recorded restructuring charges in connection with vacating certain leased facilities pursuant to a restructuring program 
the fair value of costs associated with vacated leased facilities include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
estimated sublease income is determined by taking into consideration the type and condition of the subject property  information regarding the local commercial real estate market and expectations about time to obtain a sublessee provided by local commercial real estate brokerages 
we review these estimates in the second and fourth quarter of each year or anytime we have persuasive evidence that a change in the estimate has occurred 
for example  in fiscal we recorded million in net lease commitment costs primarily due to reductions in estimated future sublease income for certain facilities related to restructuring activities initiated in fiscal and fiscal if estimates regarding future sublease income change further  we could be required to record additional net lease commitment costs 
future lease payments  net of estimated sublease income  relating to the remaining facilities vacated pursuant to our restructuring program  amounted to million  million  million  million  for the twelve months ended january     and respectively  and million thereafter 
private placement of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in february  we entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with various investors led by waldenvc  providing for the issuance of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a connection with a private placement 
the warrants have an exercise price of 
in february  we issued  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in connection with initial closing of this private placement 
in april  upon the approval from our stockholders  we issued the remaining  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in connection with the subsequent closing of this private placement 
total net proceeds from the private placement approximated million 
on april   we filed a registration statement on form s  registering for resale the  shares of common stock issued in the private placement or issuable upon the exercise of warrants issued in the private placement 
the securities and exchange commission declared the registration statement  as amended  effective in august reverse stock split on november   we effected a one for ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
all information regarding common stock  stock options  warrants and income loss per share amounts in this annual report on form k has been restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
repricing and exchange of stock options we continue to incur stock based compensation for outstanding stock options that were repriced in november and not tendered pursuant to the stock option exchange program in may to the extent of the price of our common stock on the last day of a quarter 
based on the stock price of at the end of january   we recorded approximately  of stock based compensation charges in fiscal year relating to approximately  repriced but not tendered options 
we also recorded  in amortization of other stock based compensation charges not associated with the repriced option exchange program in fiscal see note 
table of contents pro forma financial results we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
we also disclose and discuss pro forma financial information in the quarterly and annual financial results press release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of stock based compensation and restructuring  other charges and legal settlement proceeds 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information may help investors evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the us gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k 
the investors should also read the portions of our quarterly and annual financial results press releases which compare us gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results  and include a reconciliation of the us gaap and pro forma financial information

the decrease in license revenue in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to a slowdown in corporate information technology spending and the restructuring program we implemented in fiscal and fiscal  which reduced the number of revenue producing account executives 
the slowdown in corporate information technology spending was primarily due to deteriorating results of our customers and their decision to integrate previously purchased software rather than acquiring new software packages

as a result of a stock option exchange program we initiated in may  we no longer incur stock based compensation for approximately  previously repriced options 
repriced options that were not tendered pursuant to the stock option exchange program are still subject to stock based compensation charges to the extent of our common stock price on the last day of a quarter 
we had approximately  repriced but not tendered options outstanding as of january  the stock based compensation recorded during fiscal was primarily related to these options based on the stock price of at the end of january  the recovery of stock based compensation in fiscal was attributable to these repriced options  which resulted in a million recovery of stock based compensation in fiscal this was offset by million in other stock based compensation

table of contents in fiscal  we terminated a lease for a significant facility in redwood city  california 
we entered into the lease for this facility in march the lease term commenced upon possession of the facility in august and had a term of years 
prior to its termination  the agreement required us to hold a letter of credit drawable by the lessor totaling approximately million and million in security deposits 
we vacated this facility in july and terminated the lease on october  the total termination costs amounted to million  offset by million for the reversal of previously recorded deferred rent 
our future commitments under the redwood city lease prior to the termination were approximately million 
as of february  we had paid all termination costs related to this lease 
in september  we entered into a term loan for million from a financial institution 
the term loan was secured by our tangible and intangible assets  accrued interest at per annum and matures on february  on july   we repaid the entire balance of the bank term loan outstanding as of such date plus accrued interest 
on july   we entered into a million line of credit with the same financial institution

the agreement enables us to lease equipment from the vendor under a capital lease 
at january   equipment held under the lease was  we regularly review the estimates for sublease income and to the extent that these estimates change due to changes in market condition  the ultimate restructuring payments could vary by material amounts 
we have working capital of million as of january  we believe that cash from operations and existing cash will be sufficient to meet our current expectations for working capital and expense requirements for at least the next twelve months based on  among other things  our current revenue and expense projections 
however  we may require additional financing in the future 
if we were unable to raise capital in the event of ongoing losses and depletion of our available cash resources  the absence of funding would have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we issue additional equity securities  stockholders will experience additional dilution and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the then existing holders of our common stock

table of contents factors that may affect future results the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in the case of such an adverse effect  the trading price of our common stock  which has been extremely volatile  could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment 
the risk and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
until fiscal  we experienced losses each year since inception  and we could experience losses in the future 
we were incorporated in january and began licensing our software in december until fiscal  our first profitable year  we experienced losses each year since inception 
as a result of these losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of january  although our financial results improved substantially in fiscal  these improvements may not continue  and we may incur losses in the future 
additional losses would materially and adversely affect our ability to make the investments necessary to execute on our business plan 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
our quarterly operating results are likely to be particularly affected by the number of customers licensing our products during any quarter and the size of such licensing transactions 
for example  in the quarter ended october   we completed a significant licensing transaction which favorably impacted our operating results 
we have limited visibility into our future revenue  especially license revenue  which often has been heavily concentrated in the third month of each quarter due to traditional buying patterns in the software industry in which customers often defer purchases until the third month of a vendor s fiscal quarter 
since we forecast our expenses based in part on future revenue projections  our operating results would be adversely affected if we cannot meet those revenue projections 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include changes in the pricing of our products and services or those of our competitors or the announcement or introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  the renewal or non renewal of annual maintenance contracts by our customers  especially the renewal or non renewal of annual maintenance contracts on legacy products which continue to represent a material portion of our maintenance revenue  the demand for professional services to implement our products and our efficiency in rendering such services  variability in the mix of our product and services revenue in any quarter  the amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to the business  changes in restructuring accruals based on changes in sublease estimates for lease facilities we vacated  the application of variable accounting to stock options that were previously repriced but not exchanged by our employees pursuant to our stock option exchange program  and changes in foreign exchange rates 

table of contents due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
if we are unable to meet the expectations of investors with regard to future operating results  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
we experience seasonality in our sales  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we experience seasonality in the licensing of our products and sales of our services 
for example  revenue historically has been lower in our first fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers 
we also expect that revenues in european markets may decline during july  the last month of our second fiscal quarter  and august  the first month of our third fiscal quarter 
these seasonal variations in our revenue are likely to lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
intense competition in our market is highly competitive which could make it difficult for us to attract customers  cause us to reduce prices  and result in poor operating results the market for our products and services is competitive  dynamic and subject to frequent technological changes 
we expect the intensity of competition and the pace of change to increase in the future 
our products compete with products of varying functionality offered by competing software vendors and products that have been developed by potential customers in house developments and it organizations 
the primary competitive factors include product functionality  ease of implementation  ability to support large distributed user groups and meet other enterprise requirements  price and worldwide sales  support and professional services capabilities 
some of our competitors include privately held providers of project management  portfolio management and professional services automation software  and publicly held software companies such as lawson  mercury interactive  microsoft  oracle  peoplesoft  and sap 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current or potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources 
competitors with greater resources may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees  distributors  resellers or other strategic partners 
we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the market for our software continues to develop 
our products have a long sales cycle  which increases the cost of completing sales and renders completion of sales less predictable 
the sales cycle for our products is long  typically from six to nine months  making it difficult to predict the quarter in which we may recognize revenue from a sale  if at all 
our lengthy sales cycle increases our costs and may cause license revenue and other operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
our products often are part of significant strategic decisions by our customers regarding their information systems 
accordingly  the decision to license our products typically requires significant pre purchase evaluation 
we spend substantial time providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
during this evaluation period  we may expend significant funds in sales and marketing efforts 
if anticipated sales from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  our operating results may be adversely affected 

table of contents implementation of our products may be costly and time consuming  and customers may become dissatisfied with the implementation time  expense or requirements  which could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
implementation of our products may be costly and time consuming 
customers could become dissatisfied with our products if implementation requires more time  expense or resources than they expected 
additionally  our financial results would be adversely impacted if  for customer satisfaction and reputation reasons  we do not bill our customers for time and expenses we incur in connection with these implementation issues 
as part of the implementation  our products must integrate with many of our customers existing computer systems and software programs 
integrating with a number of computer systems and software programs can be time consuming and expensive and could lead to customer dissatisfaction and increased expenses 
in the event that customers become dissatisfied with this process  our reputation may be harmed and the acceptance of our products by the market may decrease 
our products may contain undetected defects and errors which could result in loss of or delay in revenue  failure to achieve market acceptance  or increased costs and other liabilities 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected defects or errors 
despite internal testing and testing by our customers or potential customers  defects or errors may occur in our existing or future products 
such errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
in the future  if we are not able to detect and correct errors prior to release  we may experience a loss of or delay in revenue  failure to achieve market acceptance and increased costs to correct errors  any of which could adversely affect our operating results 
defects or errors could also result in tort or warranty claims 
warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our customer agreements may not be enforceable 
furthermore  our errors and omissions insurance may not adequately cover us for claims 
if a court were to refuse to enforce the liability limiting provisions of our contracts for any reason  or if liabilities arose that were not contractually limited or adequately covered by insurance  our operating results could be adversely affected 
because a significant portion of our revenues comes from our international operations  we are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries that could adversely affect our results of operations 
international revenue represented of our total revenue for fiscal  making international activities a significant part of our business 
accordingly  we are exposed to risks that we would not face if we conducted our operations only in the united states 
these include currency exchange rate fluctuations  particularly in countries where  we sell our products in denominations other than us dollars  such as in the united kingdom and the euro zone or have exposures in intercompany accounts denominated in foreign currencies  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns in other countries  particularly declining sales during july and august in european markets  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries  particularly european countries in which collections take considerably more time than the united states and collections are more difficult to effect  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  
table of contents the need to develop internationalized versions of our products and marketing and sales materials  and tariffs  export controls and other trade barriers 
market acceptance of our products and services may suffer if we are unable to enhance our products to meet the rapid technological changes in our industry 
rapidly changing technology and standards may impede market acceptance of our products and services 
our business relies primarily on our licensing the rights to our products  particularly clarity  and their components 
clarity has been designed based upon currently prevailing technologies such as hypertext markup language html  extensible markup language xml  extensible stylesheet language xsl  java two platform enterprise edition jee  secure sockets layer ssl  and simple object access protocol soap 
if new technologies emerge that are incompatible with of our products  our products could become obsolete and our existing and potential customers might seek alternatives 
we may not be able to adapt quickly to new technologies 
additionally  we design our products to work with databases such as oracle database server and sql server and operating systems such as sun solaris  microsoft windows  aix  hp ux and application servers such as orion  weblogic  and websphere 
any changes to those products or increasing popularity of other products might require us to modify one or both of our products or services and could cause us to delay releasing future products and enhancements 
as a result  the timing and nature of new product introductions or product modifications  and increases and decreases in the market acceptance of these products  could delay our product development  increase our research and development expenses and cause customers to delay evaluation  purchase and deployment of our products  all of which could adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitors might be able to use our technologies to develop their own products  which would harm our ability to compete 
we regard substantial elements of our products as proprietary and any steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate  time consuming  and expensive 
we may make efforts to protect them  however we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property  which could significantly harm our business and our ability to compete 
for example  notwithstanding the security systems in place in  business engine corporation  a competitor  entered our network and misappropriated sales and development documents 
as a result of this intrusion  we pursued litigation against business engine 
while this litigation resulted in the payment to us by business engine of million and an agreement by business engine to have its products monitored by a third party for a year  it also required us to devote management time and expense to prosecute the litigation against business engine 
we rely to a large degree on copyright laws with respect to our software  but we have not made any copyright registration with any government entity with respect to our products 
although registration is not required to obtain protection under copyright laws  our failure to register may limit our ability to seek certain remedies available under such laws 
currently  we have one issued patent and other patent applications pending 
our current patent and patents that may be issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages over  or may be challenged by third parties 
we received us registration of the trademarks niku  the niku logo  and do what matters 
these registrations may not provide us with significant protection for our trademarks 
there are numerous patents involving software and technology related to our products and services held by various third parties 
from time to time  in the past we have and in the future we expect to receive notices of potential infringement from third parties demanding that we cease any infringement and inviting us to take a license in order to continue marketing our products 
if we were to infringe the patents of others  we may be require to obtain a license  which could be costly 

table of contents the copyright and trade secret laws  which are the principal source of protection for our intellectual property  offer only limited protection 
in addition  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in software are uncertain and still evolving  and the future viability or value of any of our intellectual property rights is uncertain 
effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are distributed or made available 
although we have taken precautionary measures to maintain our proprietary information  others may acquire equivalent information or otherwise gain access to or disclose our proprietary information 
in the event that we are unable to meaningfully protect our rights to our proprietary information  our ability to compete will likely be harmed 
we indemnify our customers against infringement claims involving our products  which could require us to incur substantial costs defending our rights and the interests of our customers 
our standard product licenses provide that we agree to indemnify our customers against claims that our products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
there has been an increasing number of software patents issued  and this increased issuance rate heightens the likelihood of infringement claims 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert management s attention from operating our business 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against infringement claims 
if we become liable to third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop non infringing technology  obtain one or more licenses for us and our customers from third parties  or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or obtain a license at a reasonable cost  or at all 
if we are unable to license our technology  we would be unable to support our operations which would significantly harm our business 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  certain voting agreements and the concentration of stock ownership could delay or prevent a change of control  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control  even if a change in control would presumably be beneficial to our stockholders 
relevant provisions include those authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval  requiring two thirds of the outstanding shares to approve amendments to some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  requiring a majority of the stockholders to call stockholders meetings  and prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent 
in addition  farzad and rhonda dibachi  our former chief executive officer and executive vice president of strategy and planning  and limar realty corp 
 the landlord for a significant facility whose lease we terminated in fiscal  have entered into voting agreements in which they have agreed  in the case of the dibachis  to vote as recommended unanimously by the board and  in the case of limar  to vote as recommended by the board or in the same proportion as other votes cast on a given matter excluding votes by the dibachis 
these provisions could delay or prevent an attempt to replace or remove our management and may make it more difficult for another party to take over our company without the approval of our board 

table of contents further  walden vc and its related funds beneficially own of our outstanding common stock 
this concentration of ownership gives walden significant power to effect the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors or to delay or prevent a change in control of the business that may be in the best interests of other stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america  europe and asia 
approximately of our total revenue was in currencies other than us dollars in fiscal accordingly  our financial results have been and will be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our exposures to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arise from intercompany accounts with our foreign subsidiaries which are typically denominated in the currency of the foreign subsidiary 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we started hedging our intercompany accounts denominated in foreign currency 
we will continue to assess the need to further utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits  certificates of deposit and money market accounts that mature in three months or less 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  we believe that there is no material market or interest rate risk exposure on our cash and cash equivalents 
we do not believe that we have interest rate exposure on our line of credit because of the short term nature of the borrowings 
we do not believe an immediate increase or decrease in interest rate would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
