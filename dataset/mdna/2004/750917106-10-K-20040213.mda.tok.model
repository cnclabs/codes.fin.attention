item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  our expectations regarding revenues  expenses and results of operations 
our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the risk factors section  and below 
we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or such risk factors 
overview rambus inc creates a broad range of chip to chip interface technologies that enhance the performance and cost effectiveness of our customers semiconductor and system products 
these solutions are used in a broad range of computing  consumer electronics and communications applications 
our interface solutions can be grouped into two major categories memory interfaces and logic interfaces 
our memory interface solutions provide an interface between memory chips and logic chips 
our logic interface solutions provide an interface between two logic chips 
these solutions are currently covered by more than us and international patents  and we currently have over patent applications currently pending 
our advanced chip to chip interface solutions increase the data transfer rate between semiconductor chips  improving performance and reducing systems costs 
these solutions are used in a broad range of computing  consumer electronics and communications applications 
we license our patented inventions to semiconductor and system companies who incorporate them into interfaces of their own design and pay us royalties 
also  we license our intellectual property to semiconductor and system companies who incorporate our interface technologies into their semiconductors and systems  for which we receive royalty payments or other revenues 
in addition  we offer engineering services to companies to help them successfully integrate our interface technologies into their chip and system products 
royalties represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
the remaining part of our revenue is contract revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognized revenue are recorded as deferred revenues 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can have a significant impact on deferred revenues in any given period 
we have a high degree of customer concentration  with our top five customers representing and of our revenue for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
our top three customers were intel  samsung and toshiba for both years  who each accounted for more than of our revenues in each 
table of contents year 
our revenue from companies based outside of the united states accounted for and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to have significant revenues from companies based outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
for the last three years  we have been involved in significant litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high and difficult to predict during this time and we anticipate future litigation expenses to continue to be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our revenue could be substantially higher in the future  if we are unsuccessful  our revenue would likely decline 
subsequent event on february   the technical appeals board of the european patent office issued an oral ruling revoking our european patent no 
without explanation 
a written opinion of the appeals board would typically issue in four to ten weeks from the date of the oral ruling 
for more information regarding this subsequent event  see note under litigation and asserted claims of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page revenues our revenues consist of royalty revenues and contract revenues generated from the following five types of agreements with semiconductor and systems companies rdram licenses  which are licenses for chips fully compatible with the rdram memory interface  xdr and redwood licenses  which are licenses for chips fully compatible with the xdr and redwood interfaces  raser licenses  which are licenses for our raser interface that licensees integrate into their logic semiconductors  a patent cross license with intel corporation  or intel  and sdram and ddr compatible licenses  which are licenses that cover the use of our patents and other intellectual property in synchronous dram  or sdram  and double data rate  or ddr  memory devices and controllers which control such memory 
we do not recognize contract revenues in excess of cash received if collectibility is not probable 
we recognize royalty revenues upon notification of sale by our licensees if collectibility is probable 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally require licensees to give us notification and to pay us royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales take place 
as of december   our deferred revenue from rdram  xdr  raser  sdram and ddr compatible and redwood licenses was million  substantially all of which is scheduled to be recognized in varying amounts over the next six years 
royalty revenues royalty revenues represented approximately of our total revenues in the twelve months ended december  and in the twelve months ended december  royalty revenues can be a fixed quarterly amount  a percentage of the revenues received by licensees on their sales of licensed semiconductors or a fixed amount per serial link in the case of our raser interface family 
we recognize royalties from a licensee in the quarter in which we receive the report detailing shipments of the semiconductors containing our technology by such licensee in the prior quarter 
we engage accounting firms independent of our external auditors to perform  on our behalf  periodic audits of some of our licensee s reports of royalties to us and any adjustment resulting from such royalty audits is recorded in the period such adjustment is determined 
for the twelve months ended december  and  approximately half of our royalties were based on contracts that required fixed quarterly payments for various periods of time 
rdram  xdr  redwood and raser 
royalties for rdram  xdr  redwood and raser are normally payable quarterly by a licensee on its sales that occur during the life of the rambus patents being licensed 
in the case of rdram  xdr and redwood licenses  the exact rate and structure of a royalty arrangement with a 
table of contents particular licensee depend on a number of factors  including past practices in the market segment  the amount of intellectual property used  license fee to be paid by the licensee and  in the case of certain licenses  the marketing and engineering commitment made by the licensee 
in the case of raser interface licenses  the exact royalty rate and structure vary based on a number of factors  including volume and required customization 
sdram and ddr compatible 
sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses generally provide for the payment of fees  which include compensation for use of our patents from the time we notify the licensee of potential infringement 
accordingly  we classify these fees as royalty revenues  which are recognized ratably over the contract period 
our current contracts will begin to expire in june the excess of payments received over royalty revenue recognized is shown on our balance sheet as deferred revenue 
except with regard to one licensee with an amended agreement  royalties for sdram and ddr compatible licenses are calculated based on a percentage of the revenue generated by licensed products shipped by the licensee 
the licensee with an amended agreement is currently paying a fixed amount per quarter until there is a favorable resolution to pending litigation 
intel cross license 
in september  we entered into a cross license agreement with intel that grants intel a license to our patent portfolio 
we recognize revenue from this arrangement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payable 
the agreement terminates in september and after that date intel will have a fully paid license to all of our patents claiming priority prior to september contract revenues contract revenues are comprised of license fees and engineering services fees  which fees are derived from licenses for our rdram  xdr  redwood and raser interfaces only  in addition to the royalty revenues each technology provides 
contract revenues represented approximately of our total revenues in the twelve months ended december  and in the twelve months ended december  rdram licenses 
rdram licenses generally allow a semiconductor manufacturer to use our rdram memory interface and to receive engineering implementation services  and customer support 
we deliver to a new rdram licensee an implementation package  which contains the information needed to develop a chip incorporating rdram memory interface in the licensee s process 
an implementation package includes a specification  generalized circuit layout database software for the particular version of the chip which the licensee intends to develop  test programs and  for memory chips  a core interface specification 
some licensees contract with us to provide specific engineering implementation services required to optimize the generalized circuit layout for their manufacturing processes 
the rdram licenses also provide for the right to receive ongoing customer support  which includes technical advice on chip specifications  enhancements  debugging and testing 
rdram licenses provide for the payment of license fees  engineering fees and royalties 
revenues from license fees and engineering fees are currently recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided  independent of the payment schedules under the contract 
the excess of contract fees billed over revenue recognized is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
xdr and redwood licenses 
xdr and redwood interface licenses currently provide for the payment of license fees and engineering fees  as well as royalties 
we currently recognize revenue on xdr and redwood licenses using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
since labor is the principal input into these arrangements  we determine progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred 
our contracts generally reflect fixed prices for specific deliverables 
a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we review assumptions regarding the work necessary to complete projects on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise our estimates of the work required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total amount of work necessary to complete a project were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the new estimated total amount 
table of contents of work necessary to complete a project was greater than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized over a longer period 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees are due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
the excess of contract fees billed over revenue recognized is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
raser licenses 
raser interface licenses provide for the payment of license fees  engineering fees and royalties 
revenues from license fees and engineering fees are currently recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided  independent of the payment schedules under the contract 
the excess of contract fees billed over revenue recognized is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
revenue concentration in the twelve months ended december  and  revenues from our top five licensees accounted for approximately and of our revenues  respectively 
in addition  for the twelve months ended december  and  revenues from our top three licensees  intel  toshiba and samsung  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
we expect that we may continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future 
many of our licensees  including intel  have the right to cancel their licenses  and the loss of any of our top five licensees would have a material adverse effect on our business 
because the revenues derived from various licensees vary from period to period depending on the addition of new contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies  the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  although we anticipate that revenue will continue to be concentrated in a limited number of licensees 
the royalties we receive are partly a function of the adoption of our interfaces at the system company level 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our interfaces from our licensees and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our licensees generally do not provide detail as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenues will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences  and there can be no assurance as to the unit volumes of licensed semiconductors that will be purchased by these companies in the future or as to the level of royalty bearing revenues that our licensees will receive from sales to these companies 
there can be no assurance that a significant number of other system companies will adopt our interfaces or that our dependence upon particular system companies will decrease in the future 
international revenues in the twelve months ended december  and  international revenues constituted approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
we expect that revenues derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
to date  all of the revenues from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to systems companies are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations 
table of contents in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
for additional information concerning international revenues  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page expenses we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenues in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenues will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenues change 
engineering 
engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses 
cost of contract revenues is determined based on the portion of engineering costs which have been incurred during the period of the adaptation of our chip to chip interface interfaces for specific licensee processes 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for general development of our interfaces  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of development and implementation cycles 
as a generation of technology matures from the development stage through implementation  the majority of engineering costs shift from research and development expenses to cost of contract revenues 
engineering costs are recognized as incurred and do not correspond to the recognition of revenues under the related contracts 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  legal  finance  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
litigation expenses are a very significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses 
costs of technical support for systems companies  including applications engineering  are also charged to marketing  general and administrative expense 
consistent with our business model  sales and marketing activities are focused on developing relationships with potential licensees and on participating with existing licensees in marketing  sales and technical efforts directed to systems companies 
in many cases  we must dedicate substantial resources to the marketing and support of systems companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of administrative expenses  marketing  and general and administrative expenses in a given period generally are unrelated to the level of revenues in that period or in recent or future periods 
taxes 
we report certain items of income and expense for financial reporting purposes in different years than they are reported for tax purposes 
specifically  we report contract fees and royalties when received for tax purposes  as required by tax law 
for financial reporting purposes  however  we recognize revenues from rdram  xdr  redwood and raser contract fees either ratably over the period post contract customer support is expected to be provided or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we recognize revenues from sdram compatible and ddr compatible license fees over the contract period and recognize royalty revenues upon notification from licensees 
thus  we recognize revenue earlier for tax than for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  our net operating profit or loss for tax purposes may be more or less than the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes 
results of operations on april   rambus changed its fiscal year from september to december  effective january  the following discussion of historical operating results compares the twelve months ended december  to the twelve months ended december  additionally  the three months ended december  are compared to the three months ended december  and the twelve months ended september  are compared to the twelve months ended september  
table of contents to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended december   the three months ended december  and the twelve months ended september  and the unaudited periods of the twelve months ended december  and three months ended december  have been derived from our financial statements for the twelve months ended september  and three months ended december  twelve months ended december  three months ended december  twelve months ended september  audited unaudited audited unaudited audited audited revenues contract revenues royalties total revenues costs and expenses cost of contract revenues research and development marketing  general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended december  change audited unaudited total revenues in millions contract revenues royalties total revenues revenues were million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
contract revenues were million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in contract revenue is due primarily to recognition of revenue associated with our xdr and redwood interface technologies contracts 
we commenced recognizing contract revenue for xdr interface technology in the quarter ended december  the first contract revenue for the redwood interface technology was recognized in the three months ended march  we currently expect to recognize revenue on these contracts through royalty revenues were million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
in the twelve months ended december   our largest category of royalties relates to the license of our patents for sdram and ddr compatible products 
royalties increased for sdram and ddr compatible products in the twelve months ended december   as compared with the same time period in primarily due to increased royalties on increased shipments of sdram controllers and ddr 
table of contents memory and controllers  as of december   these royalties were recognized based on a percentage of the licensee s revenue with the exception of one contract that had been previously amended to allow for fixed quarterly payments until there is a favorable resolution to the pending litigation  as described in note under litigation and asserted claims of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the period of april  through march  there was a second licensee that had been paying a fixed quarterly sum 
as a result of the january  court of appeals decision  the second licensee  who was previously paying a fixed quarterly sum for sdram and ddr compatible royalties  reverted back to paying variable royalties in the quarter ended june  the intel cross license agreement represented the second largest category of royalties in the twelve months ended december  royalties under this agreement were unchanged in the twelve months ended december  when compared to the twelve months ended december  payments from licensees shipments of rdram memory chips and controllers that connect to rdram memory chips comprised the smallest category of our royalties in the twelve months ended december  rdram royalties decreased in the twelve months ended december   when compared to the comparable period in this royalty drop was due to a combination of falling customers average selling prices  or asps and declines in unit shipments by licensees during the period 
we believe that the unit decline is mostly driven by the decline in shipments of rdram memory chips for intel s e chipset 
certain semiconductor companies are now marketing semiconductors which combine logic and dram on the same chip 
such technology  called embedded dram  eliminates the need for an external chip to chip interface to memory 
the impact of embedded dram on our business is difficult to predict 
if embedded dram were to gain widespread acceptance in the electronics industry  and if new royalty generating licenses were not entered into between us and the manufacturers and or users of the embedded dram products  embedded dram would have a negative impact on the royalties that we receive for the use of our patents 
however  we believe embedded dram does not appear to be gaining significant acceptance in the industry 
we do not currently receive royalties for embedded dram 
there can be no assurance that competition from embedded dram will not increase in the future 
twelve months ended december  change audited unaudited engineering expenses in millions cost of contract revenues research and development total engineering costs engineering costs  consisting of cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses  were million and in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in engineering costs was primarily a result of additional engineering personnel required to meet the milestones stated in the contracts for xdr and redwood interfaces 
cost of contract revenues were million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to the additional engineering headcount necessary to fulfill xdr and redwood interface contractual obligations 
our current expectation is that we will fulfill our xdr and redwood contract obligations by the end of we believe the cost of contract revenues will continue to fluctuate over time both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue based on our ongoing contractual requirements 
research and development expenses were million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that in the future  research and development will continue 
table of contents to vary in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue from period to period based on the nature  timing  and the number of research and development projects underway 
the change in engineering headcount in any given period will also cause research and development spending to vary both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
twelve months ended december  change audited unaudited marketing  general and administrative expenses in millions marketing  general and administrative expenses were million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses primarily represents increased litigation costs associated with the defense of our intellectual property 
litigation costs were million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in litigation expenses was driven primarily by costs associated with the ongoing administrative hearing with the ftc  as described in note under litigation and asserted claims of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation expenses are expected to vary from period to period  given the volatility of litigation activities 
we expect such costs will increase in the twelve months ending december  relative to the comparable period in as we continue to defend ourselves in the ftc action and engage in simultaneous private litigation in multiple jurisdictions 
additional reasons for the rise in marketing  general and administrative costs in the twelve months ended december  included increased costs associated with additional corporate governance and disclosure requirements  patent and licensing expenses partially offset by individually insignificant decreases in several areas 
in the future  marketing  general and administrative expenses will vary from period to period based on the trade shows  advertising  legal and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period 
twelve months ended december  change audited unaudited interest and other income  net in millions interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income from our cash investments 
interest and other income were and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to the inclusion in other income of a pre tax gain of million  comprised of other income of million less research and development expense of million  resulting from the divestiture of rambus s investment in nurlogic design  inc which was acquired by artisan components 
the divestiture resulted in the receipt of cash  stock and an intellectual property license 
twelve months ended december  change audited unaudited provision for income taxes in millions the provision for income taxes was million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
in the twelve months ended december   our effective tax rate was as compared with a rate of for the comparable period in the effective tax rate decreased primarily due to state taxes and research and development tax credits 
in  we expect an effective tax rate of  assuming the expiration of us r d tax credits available to corporations in june at december   our balance sheet included gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  primarily relating to the difference between tax and book treatment of depreciation and amortization  employee 
table of contents stock related compensation expenses and deferred revenue  and research and development and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
our gross deferred tax assets of million have been reduced by a valuation allowance of million as of december   which relates primarily to the tax benefit of the employee stock related compensation expense 
our net deferred tax assets of million represent management s estimate of the amount of the tax assets which it believes will more likely than not be realized 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is subject to periodic adjustment as facts and circumstances warrant 
the ability to realize the deferred tax asset is dependant on sufficient levels of future taxable income and other factors 
three months ended december  and three months ended december  change audited unaudited total revenue in millions contract revenues royalties total revenues revenues were million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
contract revenues were million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in contract revenues was due largely to the expiration of revenue recognition periods for several contracts 
this decrease was partially offset by increased contract revenues for raser interface technologies and the first revenues for xdr interface technologies 
royalty revenues were and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
our largest category of royalties was the intel cross license agreement 
the royalties for this agreement were unchanged in the three months ended december  when compared to the three months ended december  the next largest category of royalties is from licensees for the use of rambus patents and intellectual property in sdram and ddr compatible products 
royalties increased for sdram and ddr compatible products primarily due to increased royalties on shipments of sdram controllers 
as of december   the sdram and ddr compatible royalties were based on variable royalties with the exception of two contracts that were amended to allow for fixed quarterly payments until there is a favorable resolution to the pending litigation 
as of december   the sdram and ddr compatible royalties were based on variable royalties with the exception of one contract that was amended to allow for fixed quarterly payments until there is a favorable resolution to the pending litigation 
the final category of royalties is from licensees shipments of rdram memory chips and controllers that connect to rdram memory chips 
the increase in revenues in the three months ended december  when compared to the three months ended december  is caused by growth in unit volumes shipped 
this volume growth was partially offset by declines in asps for rdram memory chips

table of contents engineering costs  consisting of cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses  were million and million  in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in engineering costs in the three months ended december  was a result of increased compensation costs related to salary increases and the hiring of additional engineering personnel 
cost of contract revenues were million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of contract revenues in the three months ended december   was primarily due to the fulfillment of contract commitments 
this resulted in the reassignment of engineering resources to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million and million  in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in three months ended december  as compared to three months ended december  research and development expenses increased as investment increased in the raser  xdr and redwood interfaces  including the reassignment of engineering resources to research and development activities as well as increased compensation costs related to salary increases and the hiring of additional engineering personnel 
three months ended december  change audited unaudited marketing  general and administrative expenses in millions marketing  general and administrative expenses were million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the three months ended december  in marketing  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased compensation costs resulting from the hiring of additional personnel and an increase in director and officer liability insurance premiums 
litigation expenses in the three months ended december  were consistent with the three months ended december  three months ended december  change audited unaudited interest and other income  net in millions interest and other income  net was million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars in the three months ended december  was due to lower interest rates and reduced rental income from the sublease of our former office facilities in mountain view  california

table of contents twelve months ended september  and twelve months ended september  change audited audited total revenue in millions contract revenues royalties total revenues revenues were million and million in the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
contract revenues decreased to million in the twelve months ended september  the decrease in contract revenues in the twelve months ended september  is due largely to the completion of contract commitments for several rdram contracts 
in the twelve months ended september   royalties decreased to million  including a decline in royalties for sdram and ddr compatible products 
the decline in royalties for sdram and ddr compatible products was partially offset by increased licensees shipments of rdram memory chips and memory controllers that connect to rdram memory chips  primarily due to the success of the sony playstation in addition  royalties in the twelve months ended september  reflect the first full year of royalties received under the intel cross license agreement which was signed in september in the three months ended march   due to the adverse litigation results in  we agreed to an amended fixed royalty agreement with a small licensee for sdram and ddr compatible products 
this was the second such agreement which called for fixed quarterly royalty payments for these products

cost of contract revenues were million and million in the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of contract revenues in the twelve months ended september  was primarily due to the successful launch and ramp of rdram semiconductors into the pc main memory market resulting in a reduction in engineering support efforts 
this resulted in the reassignment of engineering resources to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million and million  in the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in the twelve months ended september  as compared to the same time period in due to increased investments in our xdr  redwood and raser interface technologies  including the reassignment of engineering resources to research and development activities 

table of contents twelve months ended september  change audited audited marketing  general and administrative expenses in millions marketing  general and administrative expenses were million and million in the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in the twelve months ended september  in marketing  general and administrative expenses primarily represents decreased litigation costs associated with the defense of our intellectual property 
litigation costs were million in the twelve months ended september  versus million in the twelve months ended september  trial delays in several of the pending cases as well as the number of simultaneous litigation activities contributed to the significant litigation expenses in the twelve months ended september  in addition  at the beginning of january  we began to incur higher rent and other ongoing operating costs associated with relocating our corporate headquarters to a larger facility to accommodate anticipated long term growth

contingent warrants  common stock equivalents  and options warrants in october  rambus s board of directors authorized an incentive program in the form of warrants for a total of up to  shares of rambus common stock the dram incentive warrants to be issued to various rdram licensees  which vest upon the achievement of certain product qualification and volume production targets 
the warrants  to be issued at the time the targets are met  have an exercise price of per share and a life of five years 
these warrants vest and become exercisable only upon the achievement of certain milestones by intel relating to shipment volumes of rdram chipsets  which could result in a non cash charge to the statement of operations based on the fair value of the warrants if and when the achievement of the intel milestones becomes probable 
since intel has announced the phase out of the e chipset  the likelihood that the unvested warrants will vest is considered remote 
as of december   warrants exercisable for a total of  shares had been issued 
these warrants will begin to expire in february and will have expired by january 
table of contents contingent common stock equivalents and options as of december   there were  contingent unvested common stock equivalents  or cses  and  contingent unvested options  which vest upon the achievement of certain milestones by intel relating to shipment volumes of rdram chipsets 
if and when the achievement of the intel milestones become probable  there would be an almost entirely non cash charge to the statement of operations based on the fair value of the cses and options 
since intel has announced the phase out of the e chipset  the likelihood that the unvested cses and options will vest is considered remote 
these cses were granted to rambus s ceo and president in and the options were granted to rambus s employees in and these cses were granted with a term of years and these options were granted with an exercise price of and a term of years 
the magnitude of these charges is a function of the then current price of our common stock at the time the charges are taken 
for example  if these warrants  cses  and options were valued based upon a stock price of  the charge could be million or more 
the charge  when and if taken  will be non cash except for payroll tax liabilities  which would likely be more than offset by cash received by rambus upon exercise of the warrants and options 
share repurchase program in october  rambus s board of directors approved a share repurchase program of rambus common stock principally to reduce the dilutive effect of employee stock options 
at that time  rambus was authorized to purchase in open market transactions up to five million shares of outstanding rambus common stock over an undefined period of time 
as of december   rambus had repurchased million of the five million shares approved for repurchase 
rambus repurchased an additional million shares at a cost of million in the twelve months ended december  in october  rambus s board approved the purchase in open market transactions of up to an additional five million shares of outstanding rambus common stock 
rambus repurchased million shares at a cost of million during the twelve months ended december  on december   there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase another million shares of outstanding rambus common stock 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  including restricted investments of million and a long term component of million 
as of december   we had total working capital of million  including a short term component of deferred revenue of million 
deferred revenue represents the excess of billings to licensees over revenue recognized on license contracts  and the short term component represents the amount of this deferred revenue expected to be recognized over the next twelve months 
our operating activities provided net cash of million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
cash generated in the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of net income adjusted for depreciation and the tax benefit resulting from stock options exercised 
this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased billings for the xdr and redwood interface contracts and increases in prepaids  deferred taxes and other assets  primarily due to increased foreign withholding taxes paid on payments received from international licensees and the renewal of software maintenance contracts 
in the comparable period of  net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for depreciation  an increase in the valuation allowance related to investments  a net increase to deferred revenue which represents contract billings in excess of revenues recognized and a decrease in prepaids  deferred taxes and other assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively

table of contents consisted primarily cash paid for the acquisition and related acquisition costs of certain signaling assets of velio totaling million and for purchases of property and equipment including a new high speed semiconductor tester  which were offset by a decrease in restricted investments based on a favorable litigation ruling 
on april   the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia removed restrictions on million in investments 
accordingly  this amount has been reflected as a decrease in restricted investments and an increase in cash 
investing activities also included cash proceeds received on the sale of our investment in nurlogic 
in the comparable period of  investing activities primarily consisted of net purchases of maturities of marketable securities  purchases of property and equipment and proceeds from the sale of an investment 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
financing activities have consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase and option plans and the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock 
in the twelve months ended december   we generated net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and used cash of million to repurchase common stock 
in the comparable period of  we generated net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and used cash of million to repurchase common stock 
we currently anticipate that existing cash balances will be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next months 
contractual obligations we relocated our headquarters at the beginning of calendar year  and entered into an agreement to sublease our previous mountain view facilities through the end of the existing lease term in february on january   we were notified that our subtenant filed for bankruptcy protection 
we have a letter of credit as collateral for the remaining payments of approximately million  which has been included as a reduction to the operating leases in the table below 
we lease our present office facilities in los altos  california  under an operating lease agreement 
as part of this lease transaction  we provided the lessor with a letter of credit restricting million of our cash as collateral for certain of our obligations under the lease 
the cash is restricted as to withdrawal and is managed by a third party subject to certain limitations under our investment policy 
the letter of credit was reduced to million on the first anniversary of rent commencement and was further reduced to  on the second anniversary of rent commencement 
on december   we completed the acquisition of certain velio high speed signaling assets 
this purchase included subleasing from velio an engineering facility in chapel hill  north carolina 
the chapel hill sublease ends in march we expect to continue leasing a facility in north carolina after the sublease ends 
as of december   our contractual obligations are in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases total critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 
table of contents judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues consist of royalty revenues and contract revenues generated from the following five types of agreements with semiconductor and systems companies rdram licenses  which are licenses for chips fully compatible with the rdram memory interface  xdr and redwood licenses  which are licenses for chips fully compatible with the xdr and redwood interfaces  raser licenses  which are licenses for our raser interface that licensees integrate into their logic semiconductors  a patent cross license with intel and sdram and ddr compatible licenses  which are licenses that cover the use of our patents and other intellectual property in sdram and ddr memory devices and controllers which control such memory 
we do not recognize contract revenues in excess of cash received if collectibility is not probable 
we recognize royalty revenues upon notification of sale by our licensees if collectibility is probable 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally require licensees to give us notification and to pay us royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales take place 
we engage accounting firms independent of our external auditors to perform  on our behalf  periodic audits of some of our licensee s reports of royalties to us and any adjustment resulting from such royalty audits is recorded in the period such adjustment is determined 
rdram licenses 
rdram licenses generally allow a semiconductor manufacturer to use our rdram memory interface and to receive engineering implementation services and customer support 
we deliver to a new rdram licensee an implementation package  which contains the information needed to develop a chip incorporating rdram memory interface in the licensee s process 
an implementation package includes a specification  generalized circuit layout database software for the particular version of the chip which the licensee intends to develop  test parameter software and  for memory chips  a core interface specification 
test parameters are the programs that test the rdram interface embedded in the customer s product 
some licensees have contracted to have us provide the specific engineering implementation services required to optimize the generalized circuit layout for the licensee s manufacturing process 
the rdram licenses also provide for the right to receive ongoing customer support  which includes technical advice on chip specifications  enhancements  debugging and testing 
we recognize revenue on rdram licenses consistent with american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position no 
 or sop  and sop  software revenue recognition 
these sops apply to all entities that earn revenue on products containing software  where software is not incidental to the product as a whole 
contract fees for the services provided under these agreements include license fees  engineering service fees and post contract customer support 
contract fees are bundled together as the total price of the agreement does not vary as a result of inclusion or exclusion of such services and ongoing customer support 
we have not established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for such contract elements including post contract customer support 
accordingly  the revenues from such contract fees are recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided independent of the payment schedules under the contract  including milestones 
we review assumptions regarding the post contract customer support periods on a regular basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise our estimates of the support periods  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the post contract customer support periods were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over an 
table of contents accelerated period 
conversely  if the new estimated periods were longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a longer period 
at the time we begin to recognize revenue under rdram licenses  the remaining obligations are no longer significant 
these remaining obligations are primarily to keep the product updated and include activities such as responding to inquiries and periodic customer meetings 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees are due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
the excess of contract fees billed over revenue recognized is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
xdr and redwood licenses 
xdr and redwood interface licenses currently provide for the payment of license fees and engineering fees  as well as royalties 
we currently recognize revenue on xdr and redwood licenses using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we determine progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we review assumptions regarding the work necessary to complete projects on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise our estimates of the work required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total amount of work necessary to complete a project were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the new estimated total amount of work necessary to complete a project was longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized over a longer period 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees are due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
the excess of contract fees billed over revenue recognized is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
raser licenses 
raser interface licenses provide for the payment of license fees  engineering fees and royalties 
revenues from license fees and engineering fees are currently recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided  independent of the payment schedules under the contract 
the excess of contract fees billed over revenue recognized is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
intel cross license 
in september  we entered into a cross license agreement with intel that grants intel a license to our patent portfolio 
we recognize revenue from this arrangement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payable 
the agreement terminates in september and after that date intel will have a fully paid license to all of our patents claiming priority prior to september sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses 
sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses generally provide for the payment of fees  which include compensation for use of our patents from the time we notify the licensee of potential infringement 
accordingly  we classify these fees as royalty revenues  which are recognized ratably over the five year contract period 
the current contracts will begin to expire in june litigation as of december   we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements on page based upon consultation with the outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we have not accrued any amounts for potential losses related to these proceedings 
because of uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related 
table of contents to our pending litigation 
we will record accruals for losses if and when we determine the negative outcome of such matters to be probable and reasonably estimable 
our estimates regarding such losses could differ from actual results 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce aggregate investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
this process requires us to calculate various items including permanent and temporary differences between the financial accounting and tax treatment of certain income and expense items  differences between federal and state tax treatment of these items  the amount of taxable income reported to various states  foreign taxes and tax credits 
the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes results in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered in the future through reductions of taxes that would otherwise be payable 
this assessment is based in part on estimates of future taxable income and tax credits 
the actual taxable income realized in the future and the other factors that determine how much benefit we ultimately realize from the deferred tax assets could vary materially from our estimates 
to the extent we believe that recovery of a tax asset included on the balance sheet is not likely or uncertain  we must establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
the valuation allowance as of december  of million represents a decrease of million over the prior period 
the valuation allowance for these periods relates primarily to the tax benefit of the employee stock related compensation expense 
for all other periods presented in these financial statements  the valuation allowance was unchanged 
when this deferred tax asset related to the stock compensation was first recorded on the balance sheet  the price of our stock was significantly higher than it was on december  we believe that the tax benefit that we ultimately realize when the options to which this asset relates are exercised will be less than the amount of the asset 
therefore  the valuation allowance was recorded 
certain tax credit carryforwards reported on the income tax returns we file are not recorded as assets on the consolidated balance sheet until management believes they will reduce future income tax 
significant judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million due to uncertainties related to our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from the estimates or we adjust in future periods the estimates upon which the valuation allowance has been determined  we may need to record additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor
