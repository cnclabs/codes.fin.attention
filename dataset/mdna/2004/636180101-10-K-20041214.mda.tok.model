the information in md a should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements in item of this report 
throughout md a  a few events will stand out that impact the results of operations and capital resources and liquidity of the company for and first  the company  in its exploration and production segment  sold its southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties in after a thorough review of the economics of its non regulated business 
these properties were sold given their overall marginal contribution to earnings 
second  the company s exploration and production segment benefited from higher commodity prices in third  the company  in its pipeline and storage segment  purchased empire state pipeline empire from duke energy corporation on february  empire was acquired because the company believes that the pipeline better positions the company to bring canadian gas supplies into the east coast markets of the united states as demand for natural gas along the east coast increases 
in furtherance of that objective  in february  the company announced that it is pursuing an extension of the empire state pipeline as an upstream supply link for phase i of the millennium pipeline 
fourth  the company  in its timber segment  sold approximately  acres of timber properties in august as a means of financing its acquisition of empire 
the company recognized the concerns about its debt to capital ratio after the empire acquisition and therefore sold these timber properties to reduce the short term debt used to initially finance the acquisition 
another event  which occurred in and is discussed more fully in item at note j acquisitions  is the acquisition of all of the partnership interests in toro partners  lp toro 
the company has been successful in operating landfill gas projects  where the gas is used to generate electricity  and this acquisition allows the company to operate short distance landfill gas pipelines that purchase  transport and resell landfill gas to customers 
overall  the company emphasized debt reduction in and  to that end  has reduced its debt to capitalization ratio from 
at september  to 
at september  critical accounting policies the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of those policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 

table of contents the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a units of production basis 
unevaluated properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until they are evaluated 
once they are evaluated  costs associated with these properties are transferred to the pool of costs being depleted 
in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis and determines a limit  or ceiling  to the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net revenues using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying current market prices of oil and gas as adjusted for hedging to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet  less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income taxes 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the amount of the ceiling can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of additions or subtractions to proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling at the end of any fiscal quarter  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
the company recorded non cash impairments relating to its canadian properties in which amounted to million after tax and resulted from downward revisions to crude oil reserves related to the canadian properties sold as well as a decline in crude oil prices subsequent to the march  ceiling test calculation 
at september   the capitalized costs of canadian oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes were nearly equal to the ceiling for canadian oil and gas properties 
during  the canadian oil and gas properties passed the quarterly ceiling tests but capitalized costs less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes were still nearly equal to the ceiling at september  a downward revision to reserves or prices could result in an impairment of the canadian oil and gas properties in the future 
it is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future impairments under the sec s full cost ceiling test 
as discussed above  fluctuations or subtractions to proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time 
regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effect of certain types of regulation and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets 
table of contents and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
for further discussion of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  refer to item at note b regulatory matters 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  pipeline and storage segment and all other category  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments are categorized as price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts 
the company  in its pipeline and storage segment  uses an interest rate collar to limit interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company accounts for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
as such  gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective  gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be marked to market on the income statement without regard to an underlying physical transaction 
the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the fair value of the non exchange traded derivative financial instruments are based on valuations determined by the counterparties 
refer to the market risk sensitive instruments section in item  md a  for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
results of operations earnings compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in the decrease in earnings is primarily the result of lower earnings in the timber and utility segments partially offset by higher earnings in the exploration and production  international  and pipeline and storage 
table of contents segments  as shown in the table below 
earnings were impacted by several events in and  including events a million reduction to deferred income tax expense in the international segment resulting from a change in the statutory income tax rate in the czech republic  settlement of a pension obligation which resulted in the recording of additional expense amounting to million after tax  allocated among the segments as follows million to the utility segment million in the new york jurisdiction and million in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  million to the pipeline and storage segment million to supply corporation and million to empire state pipeline  million to the exploration and production segment  million to the international segment  million to the energy marketing segment and million to the corporate and all other categories  an adjustment to the sale of the company s southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties in the exploration and production segment which increased earnings by million  and an adjustment to the company s sale of its timber properties in the timber segment  which reduced earnings by million after tax 
events the company s timber segment completed the sale of approximately  acres of its timber property  recording an after tax gain of million  the company s exploration and production segment completed the sale of its southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties in canada  recording an after tax loss of million  the company s exploration and production segment recorded after tax impairment charges of million related to its canadian oil and gas assets  an impairment in the amount of million  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill in the company s international segment  and a reduction in the amount of million  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for plugging and abandonment costs in the company s exploration and production segment 
for a more complete discussion of the cumulative effect of changes in accounting  refer to note a summary of significant accounting policies in item of this report 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in the increase in earnings of million was primarily the result of higher earnings in the timber  utility  and pipeline and storage segments partially offset by lower earnings in the energy marketing segment and losses in the exploration and production and international segments  as shown in the table below 
this earnings fluctuation was impacted by the events listed above 
also  in  earnings included a non cash impairment of the company s investment in the independence pipeline project in the pipeline and storage segment in the amount of million after tax 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows

table of contents degree days percent warmer colder than year ended september normal actual normal prior year buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this resulted largely from a decrease in transportation revenues of million and a decrease in other revenues of million 
transportation revenues decreased because of lower volumes being transported as a result of fuel switching  a general economic downturn in the utility segment s service territory and warmer weather  as shown in the degree day table above 
retail revenues did not change significantly from the prior year as the impact to revenues of lower retail sales volumes was largely offset by the recovery of higher gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues and a base rate increase in the utility segment s pennsylvania jurisdiction 
the recovery of higher gas costs resulted from a much higher cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
warmer weather and lower customer usage per account were the major factors in the decrease in retail sales volumes 
the decrease in retail industrial sales volumes can be attributed to fuel switching and a general economic downturn in the utility segment s service territory 
the decrease in other operating revenues is largely related to the three year rate settlement approved by the nypsc which ended on september  as part of the three year rate settlement  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve by recording million of other operating revenues 
while the three year rate settlement was extended for an additional year  the provisions of the settlement which gave rise to the other operating revenues in did not continue in  causing other operating revenues to decrease by million in the impact of utilizing a portion of the cost mitigation reserve in revenues in was offset by an equal amount of operation and maintenance expense and interest expense thus there is no earnings impact 
partially offsetting this decrease in revenues  in accordance with the three year rate settlement which ended on september   distribution corporation recorded a refund provision of million as a reduction of other operating revenues 
while the provisions of the settlement were extended for a one year period  as previously discussed  this refund provision did not recur in because the new york rate jurisdiction s earnings did not exceed the sharing threshold 
the refund provision relates to a sharing with customers of earnings over a predetermined amount 
effective september   distribution corporation stopped making off system sales as a result of the ferc s order  standards of conduct for transmission providers  as discussed more fully in the rate matters section below 
as a result of this decision  distribution corporation most likely will not have any off system sales in however  due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales have been minimal and there should be no material impact to margins in compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this resulted from an increase in retail and off system gas sales revenues of million and million  respectively 
transportation and other revenues also increased by million and million  respectively 

table of contents the increase in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of higher gas costs  coupled with an increase in retail sales volumes  as shown above 
the increase in retail sales volumes was primarily the result of colder weather  as shown in the degree day table above 
off system sales revenues increased because of higher gas prices  which more than offset lower volumes 
however  due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales were minimal 
colder weather also caused transportation revenues and volumes to increase 
the increase in other operating revenues is largely related to the three year rate settlement which ended on september   as discussed above 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve by recording million of other operating revenues  compared to million in in both years  the impact of reversing a portion of the cost mitigation reserve was offset by an equal amount of operation and maintenance expense and interest expense thus there is no earnings impact 
the increase in other operating revenues also reflects a million decrease in refund provisions 
in accordance with the three year rate settlement discussed above  distribution corporation recorded refund provisions related to a sharing with customers of earnings over a predetermined amount 
the refund provisions associated with this earnings sharing mechanism were million and million in and  respectively 
earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the major factors driving this decrease were an increase in pension and other post retirement expenses of million after tax  higher bad debt expenses of million after tax  warmer weather in the pennsylvania jurisdiction million after tax  and lower usage per customer account in the new york jurisdiction million after tax 
these negative factors were partially offset by the absence of a refund provision in the new york jurisdiction in related to an earnings sharing mechanism in the new york jurisdiction million after tax  as discussed above 
other offsetting factors included a base rate increase in the pennsylvania jurisdiction of million after tax and lower interest expense of million after tax 
the increase in pension and other post retirement expenses referred to above can be attributed largely to three factors 
first  in accordance with the one year settlement extension commencing on october  in the new york rate jurisdiction referred to above  the company was required to record an additional million before tax million after tax of pension and other post retirement expense for the year ended september  without a corresponding increase in revenues 
second  the utility segment recorded million of expense after tax associated with the settlement of a pension obligation 
third  pension and other post retirement expenses in the pennsylvania rate jurisdiction increased by million after tax as the rate settlement in that jurisdiction reflected higher pension funding amounts and the amortization of previous other post retirement deferrals 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
in  the wnc preserved million of earnings since the weather was warmer than normal in the new york service territory 
for  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million because it was colder than normal in the new york service territory 
compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the major factor driving this increase was the impact of colder weather in the utility segment s pennsylvania jurisdiction  which contributed approximately million to 
table of contents the increase in earnings 
the remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to lower interest expense  primarily on deferred gas costs which declined approximately million after tax 
in  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million because it was colder than normal in the new york service territory 
for  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million because it was warmer than normal in the new york service territory 
purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs are attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers  and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation satisfies a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  an increase of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was higher than the average cost of per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation interruptible transportation firm storage service interruptible storage service other pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation interruptible transportation 
table of contents compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in as compared with the acquisition of empire from duke energy corporation on february  was a significant factor contributing to the revenue increase 
for  empire recorded operating revenues of million million in firm transportation revenues  million in interruptible transportation revenues and million in other revenues 
for the period of february  to september   empire recorded operating revenues of million million in firm transportation revenues  million in interruptible transportation revenues and million in other revenues 
another factor contributing to the increase in operating revenues in the pipeline and storage segment was a million increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales included in other revenues in the table above due to higher natural gas commodity prices and higher volumes 
these increases to operating revenues were partially offset by lower intercompany rental income of approximately million and lower cashout revenues of million  both of which are included in other revenues in the table above 
cashout revenues represent a cash resolution of a gas imbalance whereby a customer pays supply corporation for gas the customer receives in excess of amounts delivered into supply corporation s system by the customer s shipper 
cashout revenues are completely offset by purchased gas expense 
while transportation volumes increased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in as compared with for  the acquisition of empire was a significant factor contributing to the revenue increase 
for the period of february  to september   empire recorded operating revenues of million 
another factor contributing to the increase in operating revenues in the pipeline and storage segment was a million increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales included in other revenues in the table above due primarily to higher natural gas commodity prices and volumes 
while transportation volumes increased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the increase can be attributed primarily to the earnings impact of the increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales of million after tax  discussed above  as well as the increased earnings contribution from empire of million 
also  supply corporation interest expense decreased by million after tax 
offsetting these increases  supply corporation recorded million of expense after tax associated with the settlement of a pension obligation in supply corporation also experienced an earnings impact associated with higher operation and maintenance expense of million after tax 
compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in a major factor in the earnings increase was the fact that included an after tax impairment charge of million million pre tax related to the company s investment in independence pipeline company a partnership discontinued in that had proposed to construct and operate a mile pipeline to transport natural gas from defiance  ohio to leidy  pennsylvania 
higher revenues from unbundled pipeline sales million after tax were also a contributor to the earnings increase 
the empire acquisition in february contributed million to earnings

compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment decreased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging decreased million due to a  mbbl decline in production offset partly by higher weighted average prices after hedging per barrel 
most of the decrease in oil production occurred in canada a  mbbl decrease as a result of the september sale of the company s southeast saskatchewan properties  which is discussed below 
gas production revenue after hedging increased million 
increases in the weighted average price of gas after hedging per mcf more than offset an overall decrease in gas production 
most of the decrease in gas production occurred in the gulf coast an mmcf decline  which is consistent with the expected decline rates in the region 
lower west coast production a mmcf decline  down mainly due to a decline in this segment s south lost hills wells  was more than offset by a mmcf increase in canadian gas production 
the increase in canadian gas production is attributable to additional drilling in east central alberta 
the decline in the south lost hills wells was attributable to the maturing of the wells 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment decreased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging decreased million due to a  barrel decline in production offset partly by higher weighted average prices after hedging per barrel 
gas production revenue after hedging increased million 
increases in the weighted average price of gas after hedging per mcf more than offset an overall decrease in gas production 
most of the decrease in gas production occurred in the gulf coast a  mmcf decline 
the company had anticipated some of this decline in gas and oil production due to reduced activity in the gulf coast region 
other factors in the overall production decrease included an outside operated offshore pipeline leak that required four key producing blocks to be shut in for ten days  and a decline in drilling activity in canada related to a decision to sell the 
table of contents company s southeast saskatchewan properties 
also  earlier in the year certain production in the gulf coast region was shut in during hurricane lili and some of those wells did not return to pre hurricane production levels 
gas processing plant revenues increased million due to higher gas prices because there is a similar increase in purchased gas expense  the impact on earnings is insignificant 
other revenues decreased million largely due to the exploration and production segment experiencing negative mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments of million during compared to positive mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments of million in earnings compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with a loss of million in earnings were impacted by a few events 
in  the company sold its southeast saskatchewan properties  recording an after tax loss of million 
in  the company recorded an adjustment to the sale of its southeast saskatchewan properties which increased earnings by million 
when the transaction closed in september  the initial proceeds received were subject to an adjustment based on actual working capital and the resolution of certain income tax matters 
those items were resolved with the buyer in and  as a result  the company received an additional million of sales proceeds 
the company recorded impairment charges of million after tax in related to its canadian oil and gas properties 
also contributing to the increase was the fact that the loss in included a charge of million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for plugging and abandonment costs 
these events sum up to million of the overall earnings increase of million 
the remaining increase can be attributed to decreases in depletion  lease operating  and interest expense of million after tax  million after tax  and million after tax  respectively  which more than offset the earnings impact of a million decrease in oil and gas revenues  discussed above  and a million increase in income tax expense due to a higher effective tax rate 
the decrease in depletion and lease operating expenses primarily reflects the absence of the company s former southeast saskatchewan properties from results of operations in the decrease in interest expense was the result of lower debt balances 
the higher effective tax rate resulted from the elimination of cross border intercompany loans in september as a result of the sale of the southeast saskatchewan properties 
compared with the exploration and production segment experienced a loss of million in  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the main reason for this decrease was the loss of million recorded upon the sale of the company s southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties 
during  the company reviewed the economics of its non regulated business including certain oil and gas properties 
the southeast saskatchewan properties were identified as a candidate for sale given their overall marginal contribution to earnings 
impairment charges of million after tax recorded in related to the company s canadian oil and gas assets also contributed to the decrease 
lower oil and gas revenues  as discussed above  decreased earnings by approximately million 
as an offset  the exploration and production segment experienced lower depletion expense of million after tax attributable to the production decline and lower general and administrative expenses of million after tax attributable to cost cutting efforts in canada 
another offsetting factor was a lower effective income tax rate  which benefitted earnings by approximately million

compared with operating revenues for the international segment increased million in as compared with substantially all of this increase can be attributed to an increase in the value of the czech koruna compared to the us dollar 
earnings compared with the international segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with a loss of million in earnings were impacted by two events 
during  the government in the czech republic enacted legislation that gradually reduces the corporate statutory income tax rate from to over a three year period commencing january  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  the company recorded the full benefit resulting from the change in the income tax rate million as a reduction to deferred income tax expense during during  the company recorded a million impairment charge resulting from the company s change in accounting for goodwill  as discussed below 
these two events account for million of the earnings increase in the international segment 
an increase in the value of the czech koruna compared to the us dollar improved earnings by approximately million 
compared with the international segment experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in this decrease can be attributed primarily to an million impairment charge  resulting from the company s change in accounting for goodwill 
the company s goodwill balance as of october  totaled million and was related to the company s investments in the czech republic  
table of contents which are included in the international segment 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company stopped amortization of goodwill and tested its goodwill for impairment as of october  the company used discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of its goodwill at october  and determined that the goodwill had no remaining value 
based on projected restructuring in the czech republic electricity market  the company could not be assured that the level of future cash flows from the company s investments in the czech republic would attain the level that was originally forecasted 
in accordance with sfas  this impairment was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in the quarter ending december  partially offsetting the negative impact of the impairment  an increase in the value of the czech koruna compared to the us dollar reduced the loss by approximately million 
lower operating costs at the us level primarily lower project development costs and pension costs further reduced the loss by approximately million 
energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging other energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with this decrease primarily reflects lower gas sales revenue due to lower throughput  which was the result of warmer weather and the loss of several large volume but low margin customers to other marketers 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment increased million in as compared with this increase primarily reflects higher gas sales revenue due to higher natural gas commodity prices 
higher volumes  which were principally the result of the addition of several high volume but low margin customers and colder weather  also contributed to the increase in operating revenues 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in while margins on gas sales improved slightly  this increase was offset by expenses associated with the settlement of a pension obligation and a higher effective tax rate 
compared with the energy marketing segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in this decrease primarily reflects lower margins on gas sales  
table of contents primarily due to end of winter local distribution company operational constraints  combined with price volatility and weather related demand swings 
timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands log sales green lumber sales kiln dry lumber sales other timber board feet year ended september thousands log sales green lumber sales kiln dry lumber sales compared with operating revenues for the timber segment did not change significantly in as compared with the decrease in log sales of million was principally due to the company s august sale of approximately  acres of timber properties discussed below 
however  kiln dry lumber sales increased million due to an increase in activity at the company s mill operations 
as a result of the sale of the timber properties  a larger percentage of timber processed in the company s mills is now purchased from third parties 
compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million in  as compared with the increase can largely be attributed to higher sales of cherry veneer logs that command higher than average prices 
higher kiln dry lumber sales also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting the increase in log sales and kiln dry lumber sales  other revenues decreased million primarily because included a million gain on the sale of standing timber 
earnings compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in this earnings fluctuation is largely a reflection of the sale of timber properties discussed below 
in  the company recorded a gain of million after tax on that sale 
in  the company received final timber cruise information of the properties it sold and  based on that information  determined that property records pertaining to million million after tax of timber property were not properly shown as having been transferred to the purchaser 
as a result  the company 
table of contents removed those assets from its property records and adjusted the previously recognized gain downward by recognizing a pre tax loss of million 
the combination of these two events caused earnings to be lower by million 
the remainder of the decrease is attributable to lower sales of cherry logs in while kiln dry lumber sales increased  this benefit was largely offset by an increase in costs associated with purchased timber

interest charges although most of the variances in interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  following is a summary on a consolidated basis interest on long term debt was million lower in compared to  however  interest on long term debt was million higher in compared to the decrease in resulted mainly from a lower average amount of long term debt outstanding and lower weighted average interest rates 
the increase in resulted mainly from a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding which more than offset lower weighted average interest rates 
other interest charges decreased million in and million in the decrease in both years was primarily the result of lower weighted average interest rates on short term debt combined with a lower average amount of short term debt outstanding

cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  an increase of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in most of this increase occurred in the utility segment  largely attributable to gas cost recovery timing differences 

table of contents investing cash flow expenditures for long lived assets expenditures for long lived assets include additions to property  plant and equipment capital expenditures and investments in corporations stock acquisitions or partnerships  net of any cash acquired

exploration and production the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures and included approximately million for the canadian region  million for the gulf coast region  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
these amounts included approximately million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
international the majority of the international segment s capital expenditures were concentrated in improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants in the czech republic 
timber the majority of the timber segment s capital expenditures were for equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
all other and corporate the majority of the all other and corporate capital expenditures were for capital improvements to the company s new corporate headquarters

estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a minor extent  the installation of new services 
estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated in the reconditioning of storage wells and the replacement of storage and transmission lines 
the company also continues to explore various opportunities to expand its capabilities to transport gas to the east coast  either through the supply corporation or empire systems or in partnership with others 
as announced in february  the company is pursuing a project to expand its natural gas pipeline operations to serve new markets in new york and elsewhere in the northeast by extending the empire state pipeline 
this proposed extension project would provide an upstream supply link for phase i of the millennium pipeline and will transport canadian and other natural gas supplies to downstream customers  including keyspan gas east corporation  which has entered into a precedent agreement to be a major shipper  subject to the satisfaction of various conditions 
the pipeline extension will be designed to move at least mmcf of natural gas per day 
the preliminary estimate of the cost for developing the empire extension project is million and the targeted in service date is late in calendar the estimated capital expenditures do not include any expenditures for the empire extension project 
as of september   the company had incurred approximately million in costs all of which have been reserved related to this project 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for canada  million for the gulf coast region million on the off shore program in the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
the estimated capital expenditures for the international segment in will be concentrated on improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants in the czech republic 
the estimated capital expenditures do not include any expenditures for the company s european power development projects 
currently  any costs incurred on these power development projects are expensed 
the company s european power development projects currently include one project in italy and one project in bulgaria 
in italy  the company has signed a joint development agreement with an italian utility for the construction of a megawatt combined cycle natural gas fired electric generating plant 
the estimated cost of this project is million to million 
in bulgaria  the company is pursuing the opportunity to construct  own and operate two new megawatt gas fired combined cycle plants 
the estimated cost of this project is million to million 
whether the company moves forward to construct these projects will depend on successful negotiation of various operating agreements as well as the availability of funds from banks or other financial institutions to cover a significant amount of the construction costs 
the respective projects would serve as collateral for such financing arrangements 

table of contents estimated capital expenditures in the timber segment will be concentrated on the construction or purchase of new facilities and equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
estimated capital expenditures in the all other and corporate category will be concentrated on the purchase of equipment for a megawatt electric generation facility in buffalo  new york combined with capital improvements to the company s corporate headquarters 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations and partnerships 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or natural gas storage facilities and the expansion of natural gas transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow in february and august  the company repaid million of maturing debentures at par and million of maturing medium term notes at par  respectively 
the company used available cash and short term borrowings to repay this debt 
consolidated short term debt increased million during although a certain amount of short term borrowings were initially used to repay the maturing debt discussed above  the company was able to use cash flow from operations to repay most of this additional short term debt 
the company continues to consider short term debt consisting of short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations and or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  exploration and development expenditures and other working capital needs 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
at september   the company had outstanding short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper of million and million  respectively 
the company has sec authorization under the holding company act to borrow and have outstanding as much as million of short term debt at any time through december  as for bank loans  the company maintains a number of individual bi lateral uncommitted or discretionary lines of credit with certain financial institutions for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under these lines of credit are made at competitive market rates 
each of these credit lines  which aggregate to million  are revocable at the option of the financial institutions and are reviewed on an annual basis 
the company anticipates that these lines of credit will continue to be renewed 
the total amount available to be issued under the company s commercial paper program is million 
the commercial paper program is backed by a syndicated committed credit facility totaling million 
of that amount  million is committed to the company through september  and million is committed to the company through september  the company anticipates that it will be able to replace this facility at or before its maturity 
under the company s committed credit facility  the company has agreed that its debt to capitalization ratio will not at the last day of any fiscal quarter  exceed

from october  and thereafter 
at september   the company s debt to capitalization ratio as calculated under the facility was 
the constraints specified in the committed credit facility would permit an additional million in short term and or long term debt to be outstanding before the company s debt to capitalization ratio would exceed 
if a downgrade in any of the company s credit ratings were to occur  access to the commercial paper markets might not be possible 
however  the company expects that it could borrow under its uncommitted bank lines of credit or rely upon other liquidity sources  including cash provided by operations 
under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of million in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at then current market interest rates further limited by the debt to capitalization ratio constraints noted in 
table of contents the previous paragraph in addition to being able to issue new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
the company s indenture pursuant to which million or of the company s long term debt as of september  was issued contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company to perform certain obligations under other borrowing arrangements could trigger an obligation to repay the debt outstanding under the indenture 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if the company fails i to pay any scheduled principal or interest on any debt under any other indenture or agreement or ii to perform any other term in any other such indenture or agreement  and the effect of the failure causes  or would permit the holders of the debt to cause  the debt under such indenture or agreement to become due prior to its stated maturity  unless cured or waived 
the company s million  committed credit facility also contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company or its significant subsidiaries to make payments under other borrowing arrangements  or the occurrence of certain events affecting those other borrowing arrangements  could trigger an obligation to repay any amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if i the company or any of its significant subsidiaries fails to make a payment when due of any principal or interest on any other indebtedness aggregating million or more or ii an event occurs that causes  or would permit the holders of any other indebtedness aggregating million or more to cause  such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity

off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain off balance sheet financing arrangements 
these financing arrangements are primarily operating and capital leases 
the company s consolidated subsidiaries have operating leases  the majority of which are with the utility and the pipeline and storage segments  having a remaining lease commitment of approximately million 
these leases have been entered into for the use of buildings  vehicles  construction tools  meters  computer equipment and other items and are accounted for as operating leases 
the company s unconsolidated subsidiaries  which are accounted for under the equity method  have capital leases of electric generating equipment having a remaining lease commitment of approximately million 
the company has guaranteed  or million  of these capital lease commitments

market risk sensitive instruments energy commodity price risk the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  pipeline and storage segment  and all other category  uses various derivative financial instruments derivatives  including price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts  as part of the company s overall energy commodity price risk management strategy 
under this strategy  the company manages a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil  thereby attempting to provide more stability to operating results 
the company has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies 
the derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
the fair value of these derivatives  as shown below  represents the amount that the company would receive from or pay to the respective counterparties at september  to terminate the derivatives 
however  the tables below and the fair value that is disclosed do not consider the physical side of the natural gas and crude oil transactions that are related to the financial instruments 
the following tables disclose natural gas and crude oil price swap information by expected maturity dates for agreements in which the company receives a fixed price in exchange for paying a variable price as quoted in inside ferc or on the new york mercantile exchange 
notional amounts quantities are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract

the company would have had to pay an aggregate of approximately million to its counterparties to terminate the crude oil price swap agreements outstanding at september  
table of contents at september   the company had natural gas price swap agreements covering bcf at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
the company also had crude oil price swap agreements covering  bbls at a weighted average fixed rate of per bbl 
the increase in price swap agreements from september to september is largely a result of management s decision to hedge farther into the future in the exploration and production segment given the high commodity prices available 
it is also a reflection of management s decision to use crude oil price swap agreements instead of crude oil no cost collars in the exploration and production segment  as discussed below 
the following table discloses the notional quantities  the weighted average ceiling price and the weighted average floor price for the no cost collars used by the company to manage natural gas and crude oil price risk 
the no cost collars provide for the company to receive monthly payments from or make payments to other parties when a variable price falls below an established floor price the company receives payment from the counterparty or exceeds an established ceiling price the company pays the counterparty 
at september   the company had not entered into any natural gas or crude oil no cost collars extending beyond no cost collars expected maturity dates total natural gas notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average ceiling price per mcf weighted average floor price per mcf crude oil notional quantities equivalent bbls weighted average ceiling price per bbl weighted average floor price per bbl at september   the company would have had to pay an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the natural gas no cost collars outstanding at that date 
the company would have had to pay an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the crude oil no cost collars outstanding at that date 
at september   the company had natural gas no cost collars covering bcf at a weighted average floor price of per mcf and a weighted average ceiling price of per mcf 
the company also had crude oil no cost collars covering  bbls at a weighted average floor price of per bbl and a weighted average ceiling price of per bbl 
the increase in natural gas no cost collars from september to september is a result of management s decision to hedge farther out into the future in the exploration and production segment given the high commodity prices available 
the decrease in crude oil no cost collars from september to september is a result of management s decision to use crude oil price swap agreements instead of crude oil no cost collars to hedge future crude oil production in the exploration and production segment 
with the current commodity price environment  management determined that it could better meet its commodity price objectives through the use of price swap agreements 

table of contents options the following table discloses the notional quantities and weighted average strike prices by expected maturity dates for options used by the exploration and production segment to manage natural gas price risk 
the put options provide for the company to receive monthly payments from other parties when a variable price falls below an established floor or strike price 
the call options provide for the company to pay monthly payments to other parties when a variable price rises above an established ceiling or strike price 
at september   the company held no options with maturity dates extending beyond expected maturity dates total natural gas put options purchased notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average strike price per mcf natural gas call options sold notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average strike price per mcf at september   the company would have received from the respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the put options outstanding at that date 
the company would have had to pay an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the call options outstanding at that date 
the company did not have any options outstanding at september  the following table discloses the net contract volumes purchased sold  weighted average contract prices and weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date for futures contracts used to manage natural gas price risk 
at september   the company held no futures contracts with maturity dates extending beyond futures contracts expected maturity dates total net contract volumes purchased sold equivalent bcf weighted average contract price per mcf weighted average settlement price per mcf at september   the company would have had to pay million to terminate these futures contracts 
at september   the company had futures contracts covering bcf net long position at a weighted average contract price of per mcf 
the change from a net long position at september  to a net short position at september  can largely be explained by the high commodity price environment experienced by the energy marketing segment in with high commodity prices  customers have been reluctant to enter into fixed price sales commitments 
with fewer fixed price sales commitments  the energy marketing segment has purchased fewer contracts since it no longer faces as great a risk of commodity price increases 
the company may be exposed to credit risk on some of the derivatives disclosed above 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
to mitigate such credit risk  management performs a credit check and then  on an ongoing basis  monitors counterparty credit exposure 
management has obtained guarantees from the parent companies of the respective counterparties to its derivatives 
at september   the company used seven counterparties for its over the counter derivatives 
at september   no individual counterparty represented greater than of total credit risk measured as volumes hedged by an individual counterparty as a percentage of the company s total volumes hedged

new york jurisdiction on october   the nypsc approved a settlement agreement agreement between distribution corporation  staff of the department of public service  the new york state consumer protection board and multiple intervenors an advocate for large commercial and industrial customers collectively  parties that established rates for the three year period ending september  on july   the parties and other interests executed a settlement agreement settlement to extend the terms of the agreement and distribution corporation s restructuring plan one year commencing october  the settlement was approved by the nypsc in an order issued on september  as approved  the settlement continued existing base rates  but reduced the level above which earnings are shared with customers from the previous return on equity to 
in addition  the settlement increased the combined pension and other post retirement benefit expense by million  without a corresponding increase in revenues 
most other features of distribution corporation s service remained largely unchanged 
in april  distribution corporation commenced confidential settlement negotiations with the nypsc and other parties concerning  among other things  its revenue requirement for the year ending september  those settlement discussions failed to produce an agreement prior to the expiration of the settlement 
on august   distribution corporation filed proposed tariff amendments and supporting testimony designed to increase its annual revenues by million beginning october  the rate request was filed to address throughput reductions and increased operating costs such as uncollectibles and personnel expenses 
in accordance with standard rate case procedure  the nypsc suspended distribution corporation s filing as provided by law in order to allow time for an investigation and hearings 
following hearings and further proceedings  the commission will issue an order approving  rejecting or modifying distribution corporation s rate request for an anticipated effective date of late july  distribution corporation is unable to ascertain the outcome of the rate proceeding at this time

the filing requested removal of the bill credit effective october  on september   the nypsc issued an order rejecting distribution corporation s request for the stated reason that distribution corporation s earnings were adequate  in the nypsc s opinion  without removal of the bill credit 
distribution corporation is contemplating further action on the nypsc s order 
in another order issued on september   the nypsc directed the continuation  with modification  of four programs under the settlement that were scheduled to expire on september  the effect of the nypsc s order was to unilaterally extend the terms of the settlement without distribution corporation s consent 
although the nypsc s order stated that it provided for funding of the programs  distribution corporation petitioned supreme court  albany county for an injunction to allow the programs to expire on their own terms 
distribution corporation s petition was partially successful  and the proceeding remains pending 
on september   the nypsc issued an order under which distribution corporation was directed to show cause why an action for penalties of million should not be commenced against it for alleged violations of consumer protection requirements

on october   the parties reached a settlement of all issues 
the settlement was submitted to the administrative law judge  who  on november   issued a decision recommending adoption of the settlement 
the settlement provides for a base rate increase of million and authorizes deferral accounting for pension and other post retirement benefit expenses 
the settlement was approved by the papuc on december   and rates became effective january  on september   distribution corporation filed revised tariffs with the papuc to increase annual revenues by million to cover increases in the cost of service to be effective november  the rate request was filed to address throughput reductions and increased operating costs such as uncollectibles and personnel expenses

on november   the ferc issued order standards of conduct for transmission providers order 
order was clarified in order a on april  and order b on august  order  which went into effect september   regulates the conduct of transmission providers such as supply corporation with their energy affiliates 
the ferc broadened the definition of energy affiliates to include any affiliate of a transmission provider if that affiliate engages in or is involved in transmission gas or electric transactions  or manages or controls transmission capacity  or buys  sells  trades or administers natural gas or electric energy or engages in financial transactions relating to the sale or transmission of natural gas or electricity 
supply corporation s principal energy affiliates will be seneca  nfr and  possibly  distribution corporation 
order provides that companies may request waivers  which the company has done with respect to distribution corporation and is awaiting rulings 
order also provides an exemption for local distribution companies that are affiliated with interstate pipelines such as distribution corporation  but the exemption is limited  with very minor exceptions  to local distribution corporations that do not make any off system sales and do not purchase gas in ways ferc considers to be financial or futures transactions or hedging 
while distribution corporation stopped making such off system sales effective september   some of its gas purchase arrangements might be considered by ferc to be financial or futures transactions or hedging 
supply corporation and distribution corporation would like to continue operating as they do  whether by waiver  amendment or further clarification of the new rules  or by complying with the requirements applicable if distribution corporation were an energy affiliate 
treating distribution corporation as an energy affiliate  without any waivers  would require changes in the way supply corporation and distribution corporation operate which would decrease efficiency  but probably would not increase capital or operating expenses to an extent that would be material to the financial condition of the company 
until there is further clarification from the ferc on the scope of these 
table of contents exemptions and rulings on the company s waiver requests  the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact order will have on the company 
as previously mentioned  distribution corporation stopped making off system sales  effective september  the company does not expect that change to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  as margins resulting from off system sales are minimal as a result of profit sharing with retail customers
