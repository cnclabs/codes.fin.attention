history we were originally incorporated in california as integraphics systems  inc in march we changed our name to igs technologies in august in march  we changed our name to tvia  inc in august  we reincorporated in delaware 
tvia operates in one principal industry segment 
our subsidiary in hefei  people s republic of china  had employees as of march   including employees in research and development 
this facility handles our operations and testing  and performs sales and marketing  in addition to research and development activities 
our market focus is centered on the asia pacific region  including china  taiwan  japan and korea 
we believe our hefei subsidiary affords a cost effective means for us to develop products and supports for our extensive hardware and software alliances 
our subsidiary also gives us a presence in the china market 
overview we have historically designed  developed and marketed multi media display processors for the advanced television and emerging display markets 
our multi media display processors accept video  graphics and audio signals from terrestrial broadcast  narrow band telephone lines  cable  satellite and the ethernet and blend them together on one or more displays for a high quality  customized and interactive viewing experience 
we recently changed our focus to designing  developing and marketing our display processors for the interactive television market as well as a family of flexible  high quality display processors tailored to the asia pacific television manufacturers creating next generation digital liquid crystal display  or lcd  high definition or hd  and progressive scan televisions 
we currently offer five product families the trueview family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  and the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year these product families currently generate most of our revenues 
we sell our products through two channels 
first  we sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and recognize revenues at the time of shipment to these oems 
finally  we sell our products to a number of distributors 
we defer recognition of revenues for sales to our distributors until they have sold our products to end users 
we also generate revenues from licensing software which we believe will continue to constitute a small percentage of total revenues in the future 
industry background there are more than billion standard analog televisions in the world today 
over the next decade  we anticipate that digital television  or dtv  penetration will increase from less than percent in to more than percent by we believe this rare  mass scale global technology expansion will produce unique opportunities for superior silicon revenue growth 
in january  the federal communications commission  or fcc  issued a mandate that percent of televisions inches and larger must have integrated digital capability by july and percent a year later 
the mandate also requires that all new televisions inches and larger sold after july  comply with this mandate 
several technologies are competing for a share of the dtv market including cathode ray tube  or crt  digital light processing  or dlp  liquid crystal on silicon  or lcos  plasma displays  or pdp  and lcd 
presently crt and dlp are the early price and performance leaders but  in the long term  many expect lcd to emerge as the dominant technology in the market which accounts for approximately percent of the television market 
according to the market research firm displaysearch  dtv is expected to follow a similar path to that of digital video disks  or dvd 
dvd players have enjoyed rapid acceptance over the last few years 
there are several factors that have contributed to the success of the dvd player  including ubiquitous content  smaller form factor  improved audio and visual quality and falling prices  a by product of silicon integration 
by comparison  the dtv market is small  but rapidly increasing 
based on current market conditions  we believe dtv unit shipments will increase over the next four years from million in to million in dtv growth drivers will largely mirror those of dvd players 
importantly  two of the largest components of dtv are glass and silicon  which we expect to drop materially in price over the next few years due to new capacity and better integration 
industry analysts define advanced television  or atv  or digital displays  as displays that do not contain a digital tuner and integrated mpeg decoder 
in the case of lcd televisions  they tune and receive analog video signals and  through enhanced the use of silicon based processes such as d digital comb filtering and de interlacing  significantly enhance the content so that it approaches the quality of dtv 
at the higher price points  the lcd televisions may include add in board slots for dtv tuners and mpeg decoders 
according to displaysearch  atvs  which include thin film transistor lcd  pdp  and most projection televisions lcos and dlp  are expected to grow from million units in to million units in this favorably compares to the crt television market that is expected to decrease from million units in to million units in within the emerging atv market  lcd television is the largest and fastest growing sub segment 
moreover  lcd televisions best illustrate the near term silicon opportunity resulting from the transition to digital video through the use of silicon 
lcd televisions principally receive analog television broadcasts and employ analog interfaces  yet they are incapable of scanning video in an interlaced manner 
interlaced video means that only half the image is scanned in or at any given frame or moment and as such  a viewer is only seeing half an image comprised of either odd or evenly scanned lines 
lcds only scan video progressively  and are fed interlaced or nonprogressive with poor quality analog video signals or are fed digital signals through analog interfaces 
as a result  they require silicon de interlacers 
a good de interlacer either combines the odd and evenly scanned lines as one image or intelligently doubles the alternating scan line  in an effort to clean up the progressively scanned image 
without a good de interlacing chip  the lcd monitor will robotically fill in missing lines by unintelligently doubling what is scanned 
non intelligent line doubling or dumb de interlacing  often results in a poor video image 
our solution we believe our display processors provide high quality  efficient silicon de interlacing and scaling cores that allow our customers to produce high quality progressive scan crt television and lcd television at an attractive price 
we believe our display processors  software and reference design and design support enable our oem customers to accelerate their time to market by reducing their systems engineering development 
our engineers work closely with our customers engineers to facilitate systems design 
these benefits enable our oem customers to bring products with rich features and differentiated systems to market quickly 
products our products are based on advanced architecture integrated circuits and system designs that provide real time  cost effective and high quality display processing 
we currently offer five product families the trueview family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  and the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year our semiconductor solutions include different features  which oems can select for inclusion in their products 
the trueview is a low pin count  low cost  highly integrated digital video image display processor providing the key features necessary to design progressive scan crt television

customers we target customers in the advanced television and emerging interactive display markets 
we began to focus on the emerging interactive display market in  and later expanded our focus to include the advanced television markets 
the majority of our sales in fiscal were to the broadband set top box market portion of the emerging interactive display market  primarily for video on demand applications 
in prior years  the majority of our sales were to the emerging interactive display market 
many of our customers manufacture or distribute products in more than one of our target markets 
in fiscal  sales to kanematsu devices corporation  sms electronics  ltd  weikeng industrial co  and fujitsu siemens computers gmbh represented   and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  sales to siemens communications ltd  kanematsu devices corporation and micro network korea co  ltd

sales and marketing we sell and market our display processors through our direct sales force  sales representatives and distributors 
for our software products  we also use value added resellers and system integrators that package and use our software products for resale as standard products or custom software development services 
our products are marketed primarily through reference platforms and evaluation kits designed internally and with industry leading microprocessors  real time operating systems and other strategic partners directly or indirectly through our partners channels to oems for evaluation and development 
these reference platforms and evaluation kits hardware and software have proven to be vital to our success in obtaining new design wins 
we also promote our products through our website  trade shows  articles  press releases and joint promotions with our strategic partners 
our personnel work closely with customers  sales representatives and authorized distributors to define product features  performance  price and market timing of new products 
we provide technical support and design assistance directly to oem customers  regardless of the sales channels used 
we believe that a high level of customer support is necessary to successfully develop and maintain long term relationships with our customers 
these relationships begin at the design phase and develop  as customer needs change and evolve 
we provide support through both on site customer service and remote support from our facilities 
as of march   we employed a sales and marketing force of people 
we believe these personnel have the technical expertise and industry knowledge necessary to support a lengthy and complex sales process 
we also employed four field applications engineers to assist customers in designing  testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our integrated circuits and software products 
we believe that the depth and quality of this design support team are key to improving our customers time to market and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction 
our direct sales offices are located in santa clara  california  shenzhen and hefei  people s republic of china 
all of our sales offices provide hardware and software applications support 
research and development our research and development efforts are focused on four areas device architecture and logic design  physical layer design  software development and device testing 
as of march   our research and development staff consisted of employees  of whom were located in the united states and of whom were located in the people s republic of china 
our research and development efforts have centered on architecture design  streaming media processing modes  high speed digital and mixed signal design and software 
we conduct research and development at our design centers in santa clara  california and hefei  people s republic of china 
our people s republic of china facility is located in a science park near hefei university of technology  where employee costs are lower than in the san francisco bay area 
our research and development expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses consist mainly of personnel and other costs associated with the development of product designs  process technology  software and programming hardware 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future 
manufacturing we have adopted a fabless semiconductor manufacturing model and therefore we outsource all of our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development  testing and marketing of our products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 
we develop our designs to be compatible with three foundries  united manufacturing corporation  or umc  and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  or tsmc  both of which are located in hsin chu  taiwan  and huahong nec located in the people s republic of china 
this allows us to shift production from one facility to the other in the event of a capacity constraint at one foundry 
we currently use micron technology for production of our cyberpro  cyberpro and trueview families 
we use micron technology for production of our cyberpro family and micron technology for production of our cyperpro family 
we internally design and optimize digital and analog cells through our physical layer design group 
we believe this allows us to reduce the size of the semiconductor and therefore the cost 
this also gives us greater control over the quality and reliability of our multi media display processors 
assembly of our devices is performed by advance semiconductor engineering  inc in kaohsiung  taiwan  and belling corp  ltd 
in shanghai  people s republic of china 
we may also use siliconware precision industries ltd  located in hsin chu  taiwan 
final testing is primarily performed by us at our subsidiary in hefei  people s republic of china 
competition the semiconductor industry in general  and the market for integrated circuits for advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays  in particular  is highly competitive 
we believe we can compete favorably in each of the key competitive factors in our target markets 
these factors are functionality  performance  time to market  price  conformity to industry standards  product road maps  and technical support 
our current and primary competitors are ati technologies  inc  broadcom corporation  genesis microchip  inc  pixelworks  inc  trident microsystems  inc and silicon image  inc 
in addition to these competitors  we expect other major semiconductor manufacturers will enter the market as the advanced television and emerging interactive display markets develop 
a number of companies  including international business machines corporation  stmicroelectronics nv  national semiconductor  equator technologies  inc  lsi logic and philips electronics nv  have announced that they are developing or plan to introduce competing products in the advanced television and emerging interactive display markets which could result in significant competition 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights that we develop and license from others 
we have been granted two united states patents  containing claims covering various aspects of combining digital streams of video and graphics for presentation on an output display and for changing the size of graphic data for presentation on a television output display 
we expect to file patent applications as we deem appropriate to protect our technology and products 
we cannot be sure that our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  or that any issued patents will provide commercially significant protection to our technology 
we also license from others certain audio  graphics and semiconductor technology that is incorporated in our semiconductors and certain intellectual property rights 
these licenses are perpetual and survive the termination of the agreements under which we obtained such licenses 
the protections we receive from others against infringement under the terms of these licensing agreements are limited and we cannot be sure that alternative technology exists 
in july  we entered into an agreement with hitachi  ltd  which has developed proprietary technology on system on a chip sh microprocessors  or sh as a result of our agreement  hitachi licensed to us the right to use this sh technology for system on a chip integration in our products and to manufacture  distribute and sublicense products using the sh technology 
in march  we postponed the product related to this technology indefinitely  accordingly  we wrote off million of license technology related to this sh technology 
in december  we entered into an agreement with oak technology  inc or oak  which has proprietary d graphics technology that permits incorporation of the d graphics function onto our chips 
as a result of our agreement  we were granted the right to use this d graphics technology for d graphics integration in our products and to manufacture  distribute and sublicense products using the d graphics technology 
in april  we amended the agreement with oak  in order to license oak s proprietary mpeg technology that permits the incorporation of mpeg decoding functions onto our chips 
as a result of our agreement  we were granted the right to use this mpeg technology for mpeg integration in our products and to manufacture  distribute and sublicense products using the mpeg decoding technology 
in december  we postponed the product related to this technology indefinitely  accordingly  we wrote off million of license technology related to this mpeg technology 
in july  we sold our software business and software related assets to mediatek  inc the software assets were developed internally to support our products  including home it  advanced digital video broadcasting  mpeg software  sdk software and software drivers 
in connection with this transaction  mediatek granted to us a royalty free license to continue to use those software assets to support our existing products and fulfill our maintenance obligations to our existing customers 
we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development efforts 
it is difficult to proceed with certainty in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
if our products violate third party proprietary rights  we might not be able to obtain licenses to continue offering these products without substantial reengineering 
efforts to undertake this reengineering might not be successful  licenses might be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and litigation might not be avoided or settled without substantial expense and damage awards 
cyberpro and tvia are registered trademarks  and the tvia logo is a trademark of tvia in the united states and other jurisdictions 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
due to industry practice which allows customers to cancel or change orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment  we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenue levels 
seasonality the electronics industry has historically been subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products  and this trend may continue in the future 
these industry downturns have been  and may continue to be  characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices 
employees as of march   we had full time employees including engaged in research and development  engaged in sales and marketing  engaged in operations and engaged in general management and administration activities 
of these employees  work in our santa clara facility and work at our facility in the people s republic of china

overview we design  develop and market display processors for the interactive television market as well as a family of flexible  high quality display processors tailored to the asia pacific television manufacturers creating next generation digital lcd  hd  and progressive scan televisions 
we currently offer five product families the trueview family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year  and the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year these product families currently generate most of our revenues 
we sell our products through two channels 
first  we sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and recognize revenues at the time of shipment to these oems 
second  we sell our products to a number of distributors 
we defer recognition of revenues for sales to our distributors until they have sold our products to end users 
we also generate revenues from licensing software  which we believe will continue to constitute a small percentage of total revenues in the future 
historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have accounted for a significant portion of our product sales 
our top four customers accounted for   and of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march  our top three customers accounted for  and of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march  our top two customers accounted for and of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march  various factors have affected and may continue to affect our gross margin 
these factors include  but are not limited to  our product mix  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  yields and the mix of our product sales and development contracts and other revenues 
for example  newly introduced products generally have higher average selling prices and generate higher gross margins 
both average selling prices and the related gross margins typically decline over product life cycles due to competitive pressures and volume price agreements 
our gross margin and operating results in the future may continue to fluctuate as a result of these and other factors 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range from three months to nine months or more  with an additional three to nine months or more before an oem customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products  if ever 
due to these lengthy sales cycles  we may experience a delay between incurring operating expenses and inventory costs and the generation of revenues from design wins 
we have sustained operating losses on a quarterly and annual basis since inception 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses resulted from significant costs incurred in the planning and development of our technology and services and from significant marketing costs 
we anticipate lower revenues for at least the next several quarters as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
we believe that this is due to a slowdown in the interactive television industry caused by a slower than anticipated emergence of the interactive television market  a general industry inventory correction  delay in customer product introductions in order to incorporate additional third party features  and general economic uncertainty 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we have recorded stock based compensation charge related to stock options granted below deemed fair market value cumulatively through march  of approximately million 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise price of these stock option grants and the deemed fair value of the common stock at the time of grant and it was fully amortized through march  there was no stock based compensation charge in the fiscal year ended march  we have a subsidiary in hefei  people s republic of china  which performs final test  sales and research and development  and an office in shenzen  people s republic of china  to provide complete system support including design and integration to our customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory reserves  purchased intangible asset valuations  warranty reserves  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historic experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenues 
we recognize revenues from product sales upon shipment to oems and end users provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
we defer recognition of revenue on sales to distributors until products are resold by the distributor to the end user 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized 
receivables 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including purchased intangible assets  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long live assets could be required 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated statement of operations data reflected as a percentage of revenues 
our results of operations are reported as a single business segment 
year ended march  consolidated statement of operations data revenues product sales development contracts and other total revenues cost of revenues product sales development contracts and other total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation restructuring expenses total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net interest income interest expense gain on sale of software business other income expense  net net income loss before taxes income taxes net income loss results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and revenues 
revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
revenues were relatively flat in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  and decreased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year these decreases in revenues in fiscal years and compared to fiscal were primarily due to a slower than anticipated emergence of the interactive television market and general economic conditions in fiscal years  and we generate most of our revenues from design wins with new oems that rely on third party manufacturers or distributors to provide inventory management and purchasing functions 
export revenues  consisting primarily of product sales and development contracts to oems  sales representatives and distributors in asia  represented  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
all export revenues are denominated in united states dollars 
we believe export sales will represent a majority of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year primarily due to lower overhead burden and sale of inventories previously reserved for in fiscal year the reduction in overhead burden was due to lower headcount and facilities costs 
gross margin increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year resulting from a write off of million of slow moving inventory in fiscal year and from higher margin non product revenues such as consulting revenue and software 
research and development 
research and development expenses include personnel and other costs associated with the development of product designs  process technology  software and programming hardware 
historically  our research and development expenses reflect our continuing efforts to develop and bring to market innovative and cost effective multi media display processors that process the rich media content available on the broadband network 
we are now focusing our research and development efforts on display processors for the interactive television market 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues from fiscal to fiscal resulted from the sale of our software business unit to mediatek  inc in july  partially offset by a write off in license technology 
the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year resulted primarily from a reduction of our research and development operations in santa clara  california 
we now employ employees in research and development  of which are located in the united states and are located in the people s republic of china  compared to employees in fiscal year our research and development activities in the people s republic of china provide software and application specific integrated circuit development support to our domestic operations 
the costs of our research and development activities in china are substantially lower than the costs of our activities in santa clara 
in the foreseeable future  we expect research and development expenses in absolute dollars to slightly increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal expenses on an annualized basis 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and other costs associated with the management of our business and with the sale and marketing of our products 
sales  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the decreases in sales  general and administrative expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year and from fiscal year to fiscal year resulted from a reduction in workforce and other cost cutting measures 
in a foreseeable future  we expect sales  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars to be higher 
this increase is expected to be primarily associated with the costs of implementing the provisions as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we grant stock options to hire  motivate and retain employees 
we incurred stock compensation expense of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
gain on sale of software unit 
the company recorded a gain on a sale of its software business and software related assets to mediatek  inc in exchange for million in cash in the fiscal year ended march  expenses related to this transaction amounted to 
million 
restructuring charges 
during fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  relating to a headcount reduction and an operating lease for an abandoned building 
the restructuring was recorded to align the cost structure with changing market conditions 
the plan resulted in headcount reduction of approximately employees  which was made up of of research and development staff  of operations staff  of general and administrative staff and of sales and marketing staff 
the charge in relation to the operating lease of the abandoned building represents the estimated difference between the total non discounted future sublease income and the non discounted lease commitments relating to this building 
the restructuring plan has been completed as of march  the following table summarizes the activity associated with the restructuring liabilities in thousands license technology leased facilities severances and benefits total balance at march  additions non cash charges cash charges balance at march  cash charges balance at march  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income  interest expense and the gain on sale of software unit 
other income  net was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
other income  net  generated in the fiscal years ended march  primarily resulted from a gain of million on sale of our software business and software related assets to mediatek  inc other income  net  generated in the fiscal years ended march  and  was primarily a result of interest income earned from our investments 
other income  net was further offset in fiscal years and by a lower return on our investments and declining levels of amount of cash and short term investments 
provision for income taxes 
we are taxed in our jurisdictions of operations based on the extent of taxable income generated in each jurisdiction 
for income tax purposes  revenues are attributed to the taxable jurisdiction where the sales transactions generating the revenues were initiated 
a provision for income tax for fiscal was recorded despite of prior years net operating losses 
this was attributable to the us federal alternative minimum tax applied on the gain of the software business unit 
we incurred operating losses for each of the fiscal years ended march  and  and therefore made no provision for income tax in these fiscal years 
as of march   we had federal and state net cumulative operating losses of approximately million and million  respectively  which are available to offset future taxable income 
if not used  these net operating losses will expire through and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended march   net cash used in operating activities was million  primarily due to operating loss of million  a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million  partially offset by a gain on sale of software unit of million and non cash expenses of million and a decrease of million in inventories 
during the fiscal year ended march   net cash used in operating activities was million  primarily due to net loss of million  a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by non cash expenses of million and decreases of million and million in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and inventories  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended march   net cash used in operating activities was million  primarily due to net loss of million  a decrease in accrued expenses of million  partially offset by non cash expenses of million and decreases of million and million in accounts receivable and inventories  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in the fiscal year compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the purchase of investments offset by the proceeds from the sale of the software unit 
cash flows provided by investing activities were million in the fiscal year compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the sale of investments 
as of march   we did not have any significant capital purchase commitments 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million and million  including repayment of capital leases  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
they were attributable to payments of capital leases  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of common stock under our incentive stock and employee stock purchase plans 
net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the proceeds from the sale of common stock under our incentive stock and employee stock purchase plans 
as of march   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
working capital at march  was million 
the following represent our more significant working capital commitments we lease its facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through july under the terms of the leases  the company is responsible for a portion of the facilities operating expenses  insurance and property taxes 
we lease certain fixed assets under capital leases expiring at various dates through february we place purchase orders with wafer foundries throughout our normal course of business 
as of march   we had approximately  of outstanding purchase commitments with a supplier for the purchase of wafers and a packaging subcontractor 
we expect to receive and pay for the wafers  within the next six months  from our existing cash balances 
future working capital commitments as of march  were as follows in thousands fiscal year capital leases operating leases purchase commitments total total minimum lease payments based on our current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment  which totaled million at march   will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
in the fiscal year ended march   excluding the cash received from the sale of our software business to mediatek  we used million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
recently issued accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  was issued in january fin requires that if an entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  for those arrangements entered into prior to february   the provisions of fin were required to be adopted at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  however  in october  the fasb deferred the effective date of fin to the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  for those arrangements entered into prior to february  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

interim financial information unaudited the following table presents selected unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended march  we believe that the historical quarterly information has been prepared substantially on the same basis as the audited financial statements  and the necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts below to present fairly unaudited quarterly results of operation data in thousands  except per share data first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total revenues gross margin net loss basic and diluted net loss per share diluted net loss per share shares used in computing basic net loss per share shares used in computing fully diluted net loss per share first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total revenues gross margin net loss basic and diluted net loss per share shares used in computing basic and fully diluted net loss per share factors that may affect results we expect continuing losses and may not achieve profitability which could affect our ability to expand our business 
we have incurred significant operating losses in each year since our inception  except in fiscal year the net income reported in fiscal year was primarily due to the sale of our software business 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future  primarily as a result of expenses for research and development 
our losses increased as we transitioned our focus away from the personal computer market toward the advanced television and display markets in we have incurred net losses of approximately million from our inception in march through march  if we continue to incur net losses  we may not be able to expand our business as quickly as we would like 
we do not know when or if we will become profitable and if we do become profitable  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability 
because the emergence of the interactive television market has been slower than anticipated  we may not be able to sell our products or sustain our business 
our multi media display processors are incorporated into products that allow interactive television 
the concept of interactive television and the market for products that facilitate it are new and developing 
as a result  our profit potential is unproven and may never materialize 
broad acceptance of advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays will depend on the extent to which consumers use devices other than personal computers to access the internet 
to date  the market for these products has not developed as quickly as our customers and we had previously anticipated 
consequently  certain of our customers have significant inventory of our semiconductors or products that incorporate our semiconductors  thereby limiting the opportunity to sell additional semiconductors to these customers until their present inventories are depleted 
our success will also depend on the ability of oems and service providers that work with our oems to create demand for and market the products incorporating our semiconductors 
unless a sufficiently large market for advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays and other products that are used for interactive television develops  demand for products incorporating our semiconductor solutions may not be sufficient to sustain our business 
a significant amount of our revenues comes from a few customers and any decrease in revenues from these customers could significantly impact our financial results 
historically we have been  and we expect to continue to be  dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our total revenues 
sales to kanematsu devices corporation  sms electronics  ltd  weikeng industrial co  and fujitsu siemens computers gmbh represented   and of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march   respectively 
sales to siemens communications ltd  kanematsu devices corporation and micro network korea co  ltd 
represented  and of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march   respectively 
sales to prediwave corporation and motorola broadband accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march   respectively 
we may not be able to retain our largest customers or to obtain additional key accounts 
any reduction or delay in sales of our products to any key customer or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional key customers could negatively impact our financial results 
our operating expenses may increase as we build our business and these increased expenses may impact our ability to become profitable 
we have made substantial expenditures on research and development and organizational infrastructure consisting of an executive team  finance  sales  marketing and management information systems departments and our design center located in the people s republic of china 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  research and development expenses represented  and of our revenues  respectively 
we expect to continue to spend financial and other resources on developing and introducing new products and services  and on our research and development activities in china 
while we have implemented actions to reduce our operating expenses  our operating expenses may increase as a percentage of revenues if our revenues decline 
if our revenues do not increase  our business and results of operations could suffer 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectations regarding future revenues 
if our revenues for a particular quarter are lower than we expect  we may be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter 
customers may cancel or defer significant purchase orders  or our distributors may return our products  which would cause our inventory levels to increase and our revenues to decline 
we sell our products on a purchase order basis through our direct sales channel  sales representatives and distributors  and our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders at any time with little or no penalty 
we recognize revenues from sales to our distributors when they have sold our products to their customers 
we recognize revenues on sales to our oem customers when we ship our products to the oem 
we permit certain of our distributors to return products to us 
if our customers cancel or defer significant purchase orders or our distributors return our products  our inventories would increase and our revenues would decrease  which would materially harm our business as increases in inventory reserves could be required 
refusal of oem customers to accept shipped products or delays or difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could have an adverse effect on our business 
because of our long product development process and sales cycle  we incur substantial expenses before we generate revenues and may not recover our expenditures 
to develop market acceptance of our products  we must dedicate significant resources to research and development  production and sales and marketing 
we develop products based on forecasts of demand and we incur substantial product development expenditures prior to generating associated revenues 
our customers typically perform numerous tests and extensively evaluate our products before incorporating them into their systems 
the time required for testing  evaluating and designing our products into a customer s equipment can take up to nine months or more  with an additional three to nine months or more before an oem customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products  if ever 
because of this lengthy development cycle  we may experience a delay between the time we accrue expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the time when we generate revenues  if any 
furthermore  achieving a design win with a customer does not necessarily mean that this customer will order large volumes of our products 
a design win is not a binding commitment by a customer to purchase our products 
rather  it is a decision by a customer to use our products in the design process 
in addition  our customers can choose at any time to discontinue using our products in that customer s designs or product development efforts 
if our products are chosen to be incorporated into a customer s products  we may still not realize significant revenues from that customer if that customer s products are not commercially successful 
as a result  our profitability from quarter to quarter and from year to year may be materially affected by the number and timing of our new product introductions in any period and the level of acceptance gained by these products 
if we fail to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products  we may be unable to effectively compete in the future 
we operate in a highly competitive  quickly changing environment marked by new and emerging products and technologies 
our success depends on our ability to develop  introduce and successfully market new products and enhance our existing products in the advanced television and emerging interactive display markets 
the development of these new products is highly complex and  from time to time  we have experienced delays in completing their development and introduction 
any one of the following factors could affect our ability to develop  introduce and sell new products and could materially harm our business our failure to complete new product designs in a timely manner  our inability to manufacture our new products according to design specifications  our inability to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner for any reason  including a lack of manufacturing capacity or the failure of our contracted foundries to meet targeted manufacturing yields  and our sales force s and independent distributors inability to create adequate demand for our products 
our future operating results are likely to fluctuate and may fail to meet expectations which could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have varied in the past and are likely to do so in the future as we attempt to meet consumer demand in the markets for advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays 
our future operating results will depend on many factors and may fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons 
any failure to meet these expectations or those of securities analysts and investors could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline significantly 
a number of factors  including those listed below  may cause fluctuations in our operating results and stock price the general condition of the semiconductor industry market  fluctuations in the volume of product sales  changes in product mix and pricing concessions on sales  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders  the timing of investments in  and the results of  research and development  changes in industry standards  introduction of interactive television services by service providers  availability of manufacturing capacity and raw materials  and inventory write offs  product introductions and price changes by our competitors  our ability to specify  develop  introduce and market new products with smaller geometries  more features and higher levels of design integration in accordance with design requirements and design cycles  the level of orders received that can be shipped in a given period  changes in earning estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investors perceptions  and the effect of the terrorist attacks in the united states and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide 
our industry is highly competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete 
the market for advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays in particular  and the semiconductor industry in general  are highly competitive 
we compete with a number of domestic and international suppliers of semiconductors in our targeted markets 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter our targeted markets 
we believe that we must compete on the basis of a variety of factors  including functionality  performance  time to market  price  conformity to industry standards  product road maps  and technical support 
we currently compete with ati technologies  inc  broadcom corporation  genesis microchip  inc  pixelworks  inc  trident microsystems  inc 
and silicon image  inc in addition to these competitors  we expect other major semiconductor manufacturers will enter our targeted markets as the broadband set top box  advanced television and information access device markets become more established 
a number of companies  including international business machines corporation  stmicroelectronics nv  national semiconductor corporation  equator technologies  inc  lsi logic and philips electronics nv  have announced that they are developing or plan to introduce competing products in the advanced television and emerging interactive display markets which could result in significant competition 
some of our current and potential competitors operate their own fabrication facilities or have a longer operating history and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing resources 
they may also have preexisting relationships with our customers or potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging products  develop new technologies  or address changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development and promotion of strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition by  for example  increasing pressure on our profit margin or causing us to lose sales opportunities 
we depend on three independent foundries to manufacture our products based on our forecasts  which could result in an oversupply or undersupply of products 
we do not own or operate our own fabrication facility 
we currently depend upon three outside foundries  united manufacturing corporation  or umc  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  or tsmc  both are located in taiwan and huahong nec in the people s republic of china 
we do not have long term supply agreements with these foundries to manufacture our semiconductor products and each has limited manufacturing capacity 
the foundries require us to provide forecasts of our anticipated manufacturing orders in advance of receiving purchase orders from our customers 
this may result in product shortages or excess product inventory 
obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or not possible  especially in the short term 
our failure to adequately forecast demand for our products would materially harm our business 
for example  in fiscal we took an inventory charge related to slow moving inventory 
the foundries may allocate capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing delivery to us on short notice 
we may encounter periods of semiconductor oversupply  resulting in pricing pressure  as well as undersupply  resulting in a risk that we could be unable to fulfill our customers requirements 
the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in the demand for  and supply of  its products 
these fluctuations have resulted in circumstances when supply and demand for the industry s products have been widely out of balance 
our operating results may be materially harmed by industry wide semiconductor oversupply  which could result in severe pricing pressure or inventory write downs 
for example  in fiscal we took a charge for slow moving inventory  which negatively impacted our gross margin for fiscal on the other hand  in a market with undersupply  we would have to compete with larger companies for limited manufacturing capacity 
if material shortages occur  we may incur additional costs to procure the scarce components or be unable to have our products manufactured in a timely manner or in quantities necessary to meet our requirements 
since we outsource all of our manufacturing  we are particularly vulnerable to supply shortages 
as a result  we may be unable to fill orders and may lose customers 
any future industry wide oversupply or undersupply of semiconductors would materially harm our business and have a negative impact on our earnings 
if we have to qualify new independent foundries for any of our products and do not have sufficient supply of our products on hand  we may lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 
processes used to manufacture our products are complex  customized to our specifications and can only be performed by a limited number of manufacturing facilities 
the foundries we use have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new process technologies 
in addition  the foundries we use are located in a seismically active area  and earthquakes have caused these foundries to close for repairs  resulting in a delay in manufacturing our products 
although we primarily utilize two independent foundries  most of our components are not manufactured at both foundries at any given time 
the inability of one of the foundries to provide components could result in significant delays and harm our business 
in the event either foundry experienced manufacturing or financial difficulties or suffered any damage or destruction to its facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner 
for example  in september  taiwan experienced a major earthquake 
the earthquake and its resulting aftershocks caused power outages and significant damage to taiwan s infrastructure 
similarly  in september  a typhoon hit taiwan causing businesses in taipei and the financial markets to close for two days 
in addition  as a result of the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry based in the industrial park where both foundries are located  severe constraints have been placed on the water and electricity supply in that region 
any shortages of water or electricity or a natural disaster could adversely affect these foundries ability to supply our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
even our current outside foundries would need to have manufacturing processes qualified in the event of a disruption at the other foundry  which we may not be able to accomplish in a timely manner sufficient to prevent an interruption in the supply of the affected products 
we cannot assure you that any existing or new foundries would be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields in the future  or will continue to have sufficient capacity to meet our needs 
if our manufacturing requirements are not satisfied  our business would be materially harmed 
our semiconductors are complex to manufacture and may have errors or defects which could be costly to correct 
the manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process 
foundries may not achieve acceptable product yields from time to time due to the complexity of the integrated circuit design  inadequate manufacturing processes and other reasons 
we refer to the proportion of final acceptable integrated circuits that have been processed  assembled and tested relative to the gross number of integrated circuits that could have been produced from the raw materials as our product yields 
identifying defects and determining the reason for low yields may be discovered after production has begun and at various stages of the production cycle 
our failure to discover defects early in the production cycle will result in higher costs and may require a diversion of our technical personnel and resources away from product development in order to correct the defect 
in addition  defective products that have been released into the market and distributed to our customers and end users may result in harm to our reputation  significant warranty costs  diversion of our technical and managerial resources and potential product liability claims that would be costly to defend 
our software is complex and may have bugs or defects which could be costly to correct 
our products depend on complex software that we develop internally and license from others 
complex software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
determining whether our software has defects may occur after our products are released into the market and distributed to our customers and end users  and may result in harm to our reputation  significant warranty costs  diversion of our technical resources and potential product liability claims that would be costly to defend and divert managerial resources 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks because a majority of our sales are to customers outside of the united states 
sales of our products to our oem customers and to distributors located outside the united states accounted for  and of our total revenues in fiscal years  and we anticipate that sales to customers located outside the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in future periods 
in addition  many of our domestic customers sell their products outside of north america  thereby indirectly exposing us to risks associated with foreign commerce 
asian economic instability impacts the sales of products manufactured by our customers  as does the chinese new year  during which time many manufacturers and businesses close their operations 
we may be negatively impacted by the terrorist attacks on the united states and the resulting conflicts worldwide 
we could also experience greater difficulties collecting accounts receivable from customers outside of the united states 
accordingly  our operations and revenues are subject to a number of risks associated with foreign commerce 
to date  we have denominated sales of our products in foreign countries exclusively in united states dollars 
as a result  any increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to the local currency of a foreign country will increase the price of our products in that country so that our products become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of that foreign country 
as a result  sales of our products in that foreign country may decline 
to the extent any of these types of risks materialize  our business would be materially harmed 
if the industries into which we sell our products experience recession or other cyclical effects impacting our customers budgets  our operating results could be negatively impacted 
the primary customers for our products are companies in the advanced television and emerging display device markets 
any significant downturn in these particular markets or in general economic conditions which result in the cutback of research and development budgets or capital expenditures would likely result in the reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business 
for example  the united states economy  including the semiconductor industry  has experienced a recession  which has negatively impact our business and operating results 
a further decline in the united states economy could result from further terrorist attacks in the united states 
if the economy continues to decline as a result of the recent economic  political and social turmoil  existing and perspective customers may continue to reduce their design budgets or delay implementation of our products  which could further harm our business and operating results 
in addition  the markets of semiconductor products are cyclical 
in recent years  some asian countries have experienced significant economic difficulties  including devaluation and instability business failures and a depressed business environment 
these difficulties triggered a significant downturn in the semiconductor market  resulting in reduced budgets for chip design tools 
in addition  the electronics industry has historically been subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products  and this trend may continue in the future 
these industry downturns have been  and my continue to be  characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices 
as a result  our future operating results may reflect substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of these industry patterns  general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from customers and other factors 
any negative factors affecting the semiconductor industry  including the downturns described here  could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the rapid growth of our business and operations has strained and may continue to strain our administrative  operational and financial resources  and our failure to manage our future growth could affect our operations and our future ability to expand 
we have in the past and may in the future experience rapid growth and expansion in our business and operations 
our growth has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and increased demands on our systems and controls 
our future growth may require the implementation of a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems  all of which may require substantial managerial effort 
we cannot assure you that these efforts would be accomplished successfully 
our growth has resulted in a continuing increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel  and may require that we recruit  hire and train a substantial number of new personnel 
our failure to manage our past and future growth could prevent us from successfully achieving market acceptance for our products  disrupt our operations  delay our expansion and harm our business 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of whom would impair or inhibit the growth of our business 
our success depends on the skills  experience and performance of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we are particularly dependent on eli porat  our chief executive officer and president 
the competition for employees with technical skills is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area  and we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of such qualified new personnel in the future 
the loss of the service of one or more of our key employees  or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel would inhibit the growth of our business 
we rely on strategic relationships to commercialize our products  and these relationships may require that we expend significant resources without guarantees that our endeavors will be profitable 
we rely on strategic relationships with some of our customers who we believe are the market leaders in our target markets 
these relationships often involve the proposed development by us of new products involving significant technological challenges 
since the proposed products under development may offer potential competitive advantages to our customers  considerable pressure is frequently placed on us to meet development schedules 
while an essential element of our strategy involves establishing such relationships  these projects require substantial amounts of our limited resources  with no guarantee of revenues to us  and could materially detract from or delay the completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair the relationship between our customers and us and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  our customers may develop their own solutions for products currently supplied by us  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
we depend on third party subcontractors for assembly of our semiconductors which reduces our control over the delivery  quantity  quality  or cost of our products 
substantially all of our products are assembled by one of three subcontractors  two of which are located in taiwan  and one in shanghai  people s republic of china 
typically  we procure services from these subcontractors on a purchase order basis 
their availability to assemble our products could be adversely affected if either subcontractor experiences financial difficulties or suffers any damage or destruction to its facilities or any other disruption of its assembly capacity 
because we rely on third party subcontractors for assembly of our products  we cannot directly control product delivery schedules 
we have experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the cost of manufacturing or testing of our products 
it is time consuming and difficult to find and qualify alternative assemblers 
if we are forced to find substitute subcontractors  shipments of our products could be delayed 
any problems associated with the delivery  quantity or cost of our products could harm our business 
political instability in the people s republic of china or taiwan could harm our manufacturing and research and development capabilities and negatively impact our product sales 
we operate our research and development facility in the people s republic of china 
in addition  most all of our products are manufactured and assembled outside of the united states at facilities operated by third parties in taiwan 
the political and economic conditions in the region  including the people s republic of china s dispute with taiwan  may adversely impact our operations including manufacture and assembly of our products and research and development efforts 
we cannot assure you that restrictive laws or policies on the part of either the people s republic of china or the united states will not constrain our ability to operate in both countries 
if we are required to relocate our facilities  our business will be disrupted and our costs associated with research and development will increase 
if our competitors use our intellectual property and proprietary rights  our ability to compete would be impaired 
our success depends in part upon our rights in proprietary technology and processes that we develop and license from  and to  others 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners in order to protect proprietary technologies that use our products 
we cannot assure you that these measures will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes  and they do not prevent independent third party development of competitive products 
in addition  it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we currently have patent applications pending in the united states  and we may seek additional patents in the future 
because the content of patent applications in the united states is not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our products or processes 
we cannot assure you that our current patent applications or any future patent applications will result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all  or whether any patents we have or may receive will be challenged or invalidated 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly and could result in the loss of proprietary rights which are necessary to our business 
other parties may assert patent infringement claims against us  including claims against technology that we license from others  and our products or processes may infringe issued patents of others 
litigation is common in the semiconductor industry and any litigation could result in significant expense to us 
litigation would also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor 
litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms  including limitations on representations and warranties regarding infringement and indemnification in the event of infringement claims 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology  license the proprietary rights on a timely basis or receive appropriate protection on licensed technology would harm our business 
regulation of our customers products may slow the process of introducing new products and could impair our ability to compete 
the federal communications commission  or the fcc  has broad jurisdiction over our target markets 
various international entities or organizations may also regulate aspects of our business or the business of our customers 
although our products are not directly subject to regulation by any agency  the transmission pipes  as well as much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated  are subject to direct government regulation 
for example  before they can be sold in the united states  advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays must be tested and certified by underwriters laboratories and meet fcc regulations 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which our customers operate may  in turn  harm our business 
fcc regulatory policies affecting the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services and other terms on which these companies conduct their business may impede sales of our products 
in addition  our business may also be adversely affected by the imposition of tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on systems of suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations in the united states or elsewhere could harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative discussion of market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage the exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio and we presently invest entirely in short term investment grade government and corporate securities 
these securities are highly liquid and generally mature within months from the purchase date 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we have performed an analysis to assess the potential effect of reasonably possible near term changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of any change in foreign currency exchange rates is not expected to be material to our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk we are an international company  selling our products globally and  in particular  in japan  korea  the people s republic of china and taiwan 
although we transact our business in united states dollars  we cannot assure you that future fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar will not affect the competitiveness of our products  gross profits realized  and results of operations 
further  we incur expenses in the people s republic of china  taiwan and other countries that are denominated in currencies other than united states dollars 
we cannot estimate the effect that an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our future operating results or cash flows as a direct result of changes in exchange rates 
however  we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any derivative financial instruments
