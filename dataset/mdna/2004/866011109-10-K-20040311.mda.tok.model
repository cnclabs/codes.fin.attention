overview 
the corporation s business has been conducted primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries  the bank  summit delaware financial corporation and sia 
the bank operates its branch offices in seven locations in fort worth 
the corporation s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the corporation s allowance for loan losses  investment activities  loan servicing fees and other fees 
the corporation s non interest expense principally consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  advertising  data processing expense and other expenses 
net income for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million recorded for on a weighted average share basis  net income for was per diluted share as compared to per diluted share for  an increase of 
the increase in earnings during was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million over the increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in average loans of  which more than offset the impact of the low interest rate environment and a declining net interest margin 
the increase in non interest expenses during was primarily attributable to strategic investments in new technology  new branches  new support facilities and additional lending staff 
these expenses were offset during by a significant reduction in the provision for loan losses as compared to in  loan recoveries exceeded loan losses  as credit quality and the local economy both continued to improve 
continuing to reflect an improving economy in the corporation s market area  total loans at december  were million  which represented an increase of over total loans for total funding deposits and short term borrowings also experienced growth  increasing over the same period to million 
shareholders equity was million at december   which represented an increase of compared to december  net income for was million compared to net income of million for  an increase of 
the increase in net income for was primarily attributable to merger related expenses incurred during the first quarter of when two of the corporation s wholly owned banking subsidiaries were merged 
net income in was reduced by an increase in the provision for loan losses  which was primarily due to increased loan charge offs  as compared to the following table shows selected performance ratios over the last three years that management believes to be key indicators of the corporation s performance return on average assets roaa return on average shareholders equity roae shareholders equity to assets average dividend payout ratio net interest margin tax equivalent efficiency ratio the return on average assets ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average total assets for the year 
management believes the corporation s return on average assets ratio of in compares favorably to the return on average assets ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which was in the corporation s peer group is comprised of other publicly traded bank holding companies headquartered in texas and was selected by management of the corporation 
the return on average shareholders equity ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity for the year 
management believes the corporation s return on average shareholders equity ratio of in compares favorably to the return on average shareholders equity ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which was in the shareholders equity to assets ratio is calculated by dividing average shareholders equity by average total assets for the year 
management believes the corporation s average shareholders equity to average assets ratio of in compares favorably to the return on average shareholders equity to average asset ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which was in the dividend payout ratio is determined by dividing the total dividends paid by net income for the year 
the corporation s dividend payout ratio results in a yield to market price return equal to or greater than the corporation s peer group 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average total earning assets 
management believes the corporation s net interest margin ratio of in compares favorably to the net interest margin ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which was in the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non interest expenses by the sum of total non interest income and net interest income for the year 
the efficiency ratio provides a measure of the extent to which the corporation s revenues are absorbed by its non interest expenses 
management believes the corporation s efficiency ratio of in compares favorably to the average efficiency ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which was in net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned by the corporation on its earning assets and the interest paid by the corporation for the funds  primarily deposits  supporting those assets 
the largest category of the corporation s earning assets consists of loans to businesses and individuals 
the second largest category of the corporation s earning assets is investment securities 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and sources of funds supporting those assets  affect net interest income 
interest rates primarily are determined by national and international market trends  as well as competitive pressures in the corporation s operating markets 
for analytical purposes  income from tax exempt assets  which consists primarily of securities issued by or loans made to state and local governments  is adjusted by an increment which equates income from tax exempt assets to income from taxable assets 
net interest income tax equivalent for was million  which represented an increase of million  or  compared to the net increase in net interest income in reflected a million decrease in interest income which was offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the decreases in interest income and interest expense in were primarily due to decreases in the corporation s yield on earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
the yield on earning assets decreased to for from for  and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for from for these decreases resulted in the net interest margin decreasing to in from for the decreases in the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reflect the decline in market rates from to  as measured by the decline in average prime rates over the same period as published by the wall street journal of basis points 
the increase in net interest income for was primarily due to the growth in average loans and the growth in average deposits during the same period  which offset the basis point decline in net interest margin 
average demand deposits as a percent of average total deposits increased to in from in net interest income tax equivalent for was million  which represented an increase of million  or  compared to the net increase in net interest income in reflected a million decrease in interest income which was offset by a million decrease in interest expense

the increase in net interest income for was primarily due to the growth in average loans and the growth in average deposits during the same period  which offset the basis point decline in net interest margin 
average demand deposits as a percent of average total deposits increased to in from in summary of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities although the year end detail provides satisfactory indicators of general trends  management believes the daily average balance sheets are more meaningful for analytical purposes than year end data because averages reflect the day to day fluctuations that are common to bank balance sheets 
average balances for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities also can be related directly to the components of interest income and interest expense on the consolidated statements of income 
this data provides the basis for analyzing rates earned and paid as well as sources of increases and decreases in net interest income as derived from changes in volumes and rates 
the following table presents average balance sheets for the most recent three years in a format that highlights the corporation s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities over such periods dollars in thousands average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate earning assets federal funds sold and due from time investment securities taxable investment securities tax exempt loans  net of unearned discount total earning assets other assets cash and due from banks other assets allowance for loan losses total assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts savings certificates of deposit under  and ira s certificates of deposit  or more other time other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities other liabilities demand deposits other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income and margin t e basis loan interest income includes fees and loan volumes include loans on non accrual 
the loan fees include loan origination fees which are considered adjustments to interest income 
these fees aggregated   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
related loan origination costs are not separately allocated to loans  but are charged to non interest expense 
for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include non accrual loans with no related interest income

with the projected continued low interest rate environment for  it would be expected that the net interest margin would remain in the range 
in the event that the corporation s average loans continue to grow during and the corporation is unable to fund any such growth through the generation of additional deposits  the corporation may be required to obtain funding from secondary sources  such as the federal home loan bank  which could have a negative impact on its net interest margin 
the table below analyzes the increase in net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis for each of the fiscal years ended december  to december  non accruing loans have been included in assets for these computations  thereby reducing yields on total loans

allowance for loan losses 
each loan carried by the corporation involves some degree of inherent risk 
this risk is reflected in the consolidated financial statements through the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents the amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb future charge offs of existing loans that may become uncollectible 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged against the allowance when management believes that full collection of the principal and interest is unlikely  and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when received 
adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are reported in the period during which such adjustments become known or are reasonably estimable 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to income in the form of a provision for loan losses when it is probable that all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan will not be collected 
the amount of the provision for loan losses is a reflection of management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and is based upon management s evaluation of a number of factors  including past loan loss experience  current and projected economic conditions  delinquency ratios and management s review of the value of discounted cash flows associated with impaired loans 
the corporation has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure sfas no 

these standards specify how allowances for certain impaired loans should be determined and the accounting for in substance foreclosures

management of the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain loan losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to  or exceed  the size of the current allowance 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  renegotiated loans  other real estate and other foreclosed assets 
non accrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended and on which the interest is recorded as earned when it is received 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not both well secured and in the process of collection  or immediately  if in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously recorded but not collected is reversed and charged against current interest income 
renegotiated loans are loans on which the interest and or the principal has been reduced due to a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
even though these loans are actually performing  they are included in non performing assets because of the loss of revenue related to the reduction of interest and or principal 
other real estate is real estate acquired through foreclosure or through partial settlement of debts and which is awaiting sale and disposition 
at the time of acquisition  other real estate is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value or the loan balance or settlement agreement with any write down charged to the allowance for loan losses 
any further write downs  expenses related to the property and any gain or loss resulting from the sale of the property are recorded in current operating expenses 
other foreclosed assets are other types of collateral such as autos  shares of stock and equipment acquired through foreclosure or through partial settlement of debts which are awaiting sale and disposition 
at the time of acquisition  other foreclosed assets are recorded at the lower of estimated fair value or the loan balance or settlement agreement with any write down charged to the allowance for loan losses 
any further write downs  expenses related to the asset and any gain or loss resulting from the sale of the asset are recorded in current operating expenses 
the corporation is required  by the regulatory authorities  to have other real estate and other foreclosed assets evaluated periodically 
in the event the new evaluation value is less than the carrying value of the property  the excess is written off to expense 
some properties or foreclosed assets are written down below their evaluation values when management feels the economic value has declined below the evaluation value

there was no other real estate and other foreclosed assets as of december  non accrual loans at december   were comprised of  in commercial loans   in real estate mortgages and  in consumer loans 
other real estate and other foreclosed assets included one office building  one residential property and a motor home 
the impact on interest income from the above referenced non accrual loans and renegotiated loans for the past five years is provided below in thousands years ended december  gross amount of interest that would have been recorded at original rate interest included in income interest not recorded in income loans are graded on a system similar to that used by the banking industry regulators as described on page under critical accounting policies 
in addition to the above grading system  the corporation maintains a separate watch list which further aids the corporation in monitoring loan quality 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short run or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
non accrual loans normally include weaker substandard loans and loans that are considered to be doubtful which are defined later in this section 
an independent third party loan review was completed in late in addition  a regulatory examination was completed in early based on the findings of these reviews and exams  management considers the loan portfolio to be adequately reserved 
criticized loans  loans classified as oaem  substandard or doubtful as noted on page  have increased since a significant portion of this increase is due to enhanced classification procedures and the performance of the chief credit officer employed by the corporation in the third quarter of to assist in monitoring loan quality

these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the corporation enters into contractual loan commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of the corporation s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
the corporation minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the corporation would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the corporation could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  the corporation would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
the corporation s policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
interest rate sensitivity 
the objectives of monitoring and managing the interest rate risk of the balance sheet are to contribute to earnings by minimizing adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates and to provide liquidity to satisfy cash flow requirements to meet customers fluctuating demands 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in the market interest rates and changes in net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an asset sensitive position in a given period will result in more assets than liabilities being subject to repricing  therefore  market interest rate changes will be reflected more quickly in asset rates 
if interest rates decline  such a position will have an adverse effect on net interest income 
conversely  in a liability sensitive position  where liabilities reprice more quickly than assets in a given period  a decline in market rates will benefit net interest income 
a mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in which relatively equal volumes reprice each period represents a matched interest sensitivity gap position  any excess of these assets or liabilities results in an interest sensitive gap 
the following table  commonly referred to as a static gap report  indicates the interest rate sensitivity position at december  and may not be reflective of positions in subsequent periods dollars in thousands due in days or less due in days due in days to one year total rate sensitive repriced after year or non rate sensitive total earning assets loans investment securities federal funds sold due from time total earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts and savings certificates of deposit of under  and ira s certificates of deposit of  or more other time deposits short term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap periodic gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets in the preceding table under the repriced after year or non rate sensitive category  million in investment securities will reprice or mature within one to three years and another million will reprice or mature within three to five years 
the average maturity of the investment portfolio is approximately years 
also  the above table reflects the call dates versus maturity dates and periodic principal amortization of investment securities 
the preceding static gap report reflects a cumulative liability sensitive position during the one year horizon 
an inherent weakness of this report is that it ignores the relative volatility any one category may have in relation to other categories or market rates in general 
for instance  the rate paid on certain interest bearing transaction accounts typically adjust less quickly than the three month t bill 
management attempts to capture this relative volatility by utilizing a simulation model with a beta factor adjustment which estimates the volatility of rate sensitive assets and or liabilities in relation to other market rates 
beta factors are an estimation of the long term  multiple interest rate environment relation between an individual account and market rates in general 
for instance  now  savings and money market accounts  which are repriceable within days will have considerably lower beta factors than variable rate loans and most investment categories 
taking this into consideration  it is quite possible for a bank with a negative cumulative gap to total asset ratio to have a positive beta adjusted gap risk position 
as a result of applying the beta factors established by the corporation s management to the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in the static gap report via a simulation model  the corporation s cumulative gap to total assets ratio at one year of was reversed to a positive beta adjusted gap position 
management feels that the beta adjusted gap risk technique more accurately reflects the corporation s gap position 
in addition to gap analysis  the corporation uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet  respectively 
contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions  maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio 
assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for nonmaturity deposit accounts 
based on the december  simulation analysis  it is estimated that a basis point rise in interest rates over the next month period would have an impact of approximately on net interest income for the period  while a basis point decline in interest rates over the same period would have an impact of approximately on net interest income for the period 
these varying results are primarily a product of the manner in which interest rates on demand  money market and savings deposits change 
the corporation has found that historically  interest rates on these deposits change more slowly in a rising rate environment than in a declining rate environment 
this assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis 
the analysis does not contemplate any actions that the corporation might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to be and does not provide a forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the corporation

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these classifications 
liquidity 
liquidity is defined as the corporation s ability to meet deposit withdrawals  provide for the legitimate credit needs of customers and take advantage of certain investment opportunities as they arise 
while maintaining adequate liquid assets to fulfill these functions  it must also maintain compatible levels of maturity and rate concentrations between its sources of funds and earning assets 
the liability structure of the corporation is short term in nature and the asset structure is likewise oriented towards short maturities 
the corporation s primary internal sources of liquidity consist of the federal funds that it sells and its portfolio of marketable investment securities  particularly those with shorter maturities 
federal funds sold and investment securities maturing within days represented million  or  of total assets as of december  additionally  the corporation s ability to sell loan participations  purchase federal funds and obtain advances from the federal home loan bank serve as secondary sources of liquidity 
the bank has approved federal funds lines at other banks 
the liquidity of the corporation is enhanced by the fact that of its total deposits at december  were core deposits 
for this purpose  core deposits are defined as total deposits less public funds and certificates of deposit greater than  also  the corporation s loan to deposit ratio averaged for the year 
in the event that the corporation s average loans continue to grow during and the corporation is unable to fund any such growth through the generation of additional deposits  the corporation may be required to obtain funding from secondary sources  including purchasing federal funds  obtaining advances from the federal home loan bank or other secondary sources 
in such event  the corporation s business  results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
the corporation s income  which provides funds for the payment of dividends to shareholders and for other corporate purposes  is derived from its investment in the bank 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the corporation s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  investments  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the corporation attempts to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
subsequent events 
the corporation signed a definitive agreement on february  to acquire anb financial corporation  the parent company of arlington national bank 
this acquisition allows the corporation to expand its presence into the arlington  texas market in tarrant county 
the corporation will assume approximately million in loans and million in deposits from anb financial corporation 
completion of the acquisition is expected to occur during the second quarter of  following regulatory approval  at which time the four arlington locations will become branches of summit bank  na management does not expect the pending acquisition to be accretive to the corporation s net income for its fiscal year ending december  management expects that anticipated benefits from the pending acquisition will be realized by the corporation initially in its fiscal year ending december  critical accounting policies 
the corporation s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the corporation has identified its policy with respect to allowance for loan losses as critical because it requires management to make particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the corporation  in consultation with the audit committee of the board of directors  has reviewed and approved this critical accounting policy  which is further described under the caption loans and allowance for loan losses in note summary of significant accounting policies to the financial statements 
the amount maintained in the allowance reflects management s continuing assessment of the potential losses inherent in its loan portfolio based on evaluations of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  current loan portfolio quality  present and future economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses generally associated with bank lending inherent in its current loan portfolio 
in making these evaluations  management and the loan committee take into account past loan loss experience  delinquency ratios and the analysis of third party loan review specialists 
the allocation of the allowance is determined by providing specific reserves against each loan that is criticized as being weak plus a general allocation against the remaining balance of the portfolio based on experience factors 
the loans are graded on a system similar to that used by the banking industry regulators 
the first level of criticized loans is other assets especially mentioned oaem 
these loans are fundamentally sound but have potential weaknesses which may  if not corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s credit position at some future date 
the second level is substandard  which are loans inadequately protected by current sound net worth  paying capacity or pledged collateral of the borrower 
the last level of criticized loans  before they are charged off  is doubtful 
doubtful loans are considered to have inherent weaknesses because collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable 
the general allocation is based upon the corporation s loss experience over a period of years and is adjusted for subjective factors such as economic trends  performance trends and concentrations of credit 
at december   the general allocation rate of the allowance was 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  even though they are based on objective data  it is management s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance 
therefore  from time to time but at least quarterly  management reviews the actual performance and write off history of the loan portfolio and compares that to previously determined allowance coverage percentages 
in this manner  management evaluates the impact the previously mentioned variables may have had on the loan portfolio to determine which changes  if any  should be made to the assumptions and analyses 
recent analysis has indicated that projections of estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio has approximated actual write off experience during the current economic environment 
actual results could differ materially from estimates as a result of changes in economic or market conditions and other factors 
changes in the corporation s evaluations and the assumptions underlying these evaluations could result in a material change in the allowance 
while the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses has been established and maintained at levels adequate to reflect the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  future increases may be necessary if economic or market conditions and other factors differ substantially from the conditions that existed at the time of the initial determinations
