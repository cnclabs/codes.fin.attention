recent legislation the sarbanes oxley act of is now having  and will in the future have  a great impact on the corporate governance and financial statement preparation and reporting obligations of publicly held business entities such as the company

competition the company  through the bank subsidiaries  competes with other new jersey commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  insurance companies and credit unions 
a substantial number of offices of competing financial institutions are located within the bank subsidiaries respective market areas 
the past trend towards consolidation of the banking industry has continued in new jersey in recent years 
this trend may make it more difficult for smaller banks such as the bank subsidiaries to compete with larger national and regional banking institutions 
several of the bank subsidiaries competitors are affiliated with major banking and financial institutions that are substantially larger and have far greater financial resources than the bank subsidiaries 
competitive factors between financial institutions can be classified into two categories competitive rates and competitive service 
rate competition is intense  especially in the area of time deposits 
the bank subsidiaries compete with larger institutions with respect to the interest rates they offer 
from a service standpoint  the bank subsidiaries competitors  by virtue of their superior financial resources  have substantially greater lending limits than the bank subsidiaries 
such competitors also perform certain functions for their customers  such as trust and international services  which the bank subsidiaries have chosen not to provide 
supervision and regulation the banking industry is highly regulated 
statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company s cost of doing business  limit its management s options to deploy assets and maximize income and may significantly limit the activities of institutions that do not meet regulatory capital or other requirements 
areas subject to regulation and supervision by the bank regulatory agencies include  among others minimum capital levels  dividends  affiliate transactions  expansion of locations  acquisitions and mergers  reserves against deposits  deposit insurance premiums  credit underwriting standards  management and internal controls  investments  and general safety and soundness of banks and bank holding companies

the following is a brief summary of certain statutes  rules and regulations affecting the company and the bank subsidiaries 
a number of other statutes and regulations and governmental policies have an impact on their operations 
the company is unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effects on its business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies  economic control or new federal or state legislation may have in the future 
the following summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations

satisfactory capital ratios and community reinvestment act cra ratings are generally prerequisites to obtaining regulatory approval to make acquisitions

the law also permits banks to create interstate branches  either by merging across state lines or by creating new branches  subject to a state s ability to opt out of these enabling provisions

restrictions on intercompany transactions the bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to  and certain other transactions with  the company and other affiliates 
such restrictions prevent the company and its affiliates from borrowing from the bank subsidiaries unless the loans are secured by specified collateral  and require such transactions to have terms comparable to terms of arms length transactions with third persons 
such transactions by each of the bank subsidiaries are generally limited in amount as to the company and as to any other affiliate to of the subsidiary bank s capital and surplus 
as to the company and all other affiliates  such transactions are limited to an aggregate of of the subsidiary bank s capital and surplus

as such  their respective deposits are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor through the bif  administered by the fdic 
the bank subsidiaries are also required to pay deposit insurance premiums to the fdic 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia included provisions to reform the federal deposit insurance system  including the implementation of risk based deposit insurance premiums 
fdicia permits the fdic to make special assessments on insured depository institutions in amounts the fdic determines necessary to give it adequate assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the us treasury and other sources or for any other purpose the fdic deems necessary 
under a risk based insurance premium system  banks are assessed insurance premiums according to how much risk they are deemed to present to the bif 
banks with higher levels of capital and involving a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital and or involving a higher degree of supervisory concern 
effective in the assessment rates ranged from to of deposits 
the bank subsidiaries deposit assessment rates were in and the deposit insurance act of authorized the financing corporation fico to levy assessments on bif assessable deposits and stipulated that the rate must equal one fifth the fico assessment rate that is applied to deposits assessable by the savings association insurance fund saif 
the rates established for both gcb and bcb for through are 
standards for safety and soundness under fdicia  each federal banking agency is required to prescribe noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
the federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines covering internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees  benefits  and standards for asset quality and earnings sufficiency 
an institution that fails to meet any of these standards may be required to develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
the company believes the bank subsidiaries meet all adopted standards 
enforcement powers the bank regulatory agencies have broad discretion to issue cease and desist orders if they determine that the company or its bank subsidiaries are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices 
in addition  the federal bank regulatory authorities may impose substantial civil money penalties for violations of certain federal banking statutes and regulations  violation of a fiduciary duty  or violation of a final or temporary cease and desist orders  among other things

insured depository institutions also are prohibited from entering into contracts for goods  products or services that would adversely affect their safety and soundness 
regulatory capital requirements the federal reserve and the fdic have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by bank holding companies and state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system state nonmember banks 
the regulations impose two sets of capital adequacy requirements minimum leverage rules  which require maintenance of a specified minimum ratio of capital to total assets  and risk based capital rules  which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
these regulations require bank holding companies and state nonmember banks to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets of 
only the strongest bank holding companies and banks  with composite examination ratings of under the rating system used by the federal bank regulators  are permitted to operate at or near such minimum level of capital 
all other bank holding companies and banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to above the minimum ratio  depending on the assessment of an individual organization s capital adequacy by its primary regulator 
any bank or bank holding company experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital well above the minimum levels 
in addition  the federal reserve has indicated that whenever appropriate  and in particular when a bank holding company is undertaking expansion  seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise facing unusual or abnormal risks  it will consider  on a case by case basis  the level of an organization s ratio of tangible tier i capital after deducting all intangibles to total assets in making an overall assessment of capital 
the risk based capital rules require bank holding companies and state nonmember banks to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels based upon a weighting of their assets and off balance sheet obligations according to risk 
the risk based capital rules have two basic components a tier i or core capital requirement and a tier ii or supplementary capital requirement 
tier i capital consists primarily of common stockholders equity  certain perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less most intangible assets  primarily goodwill 
tier ii capital elements include  subject to certain limitations  the allowance for losses on loans and leases  perpetual preferred stock that does not qualify for tier i and long term preferred stock with an original maturity of at least years from issuance  hybrid capital instruments  including perpetual debt and mandatory convertible securities  and subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock 
the risk based capital regulations assign balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet obligations to one of four broad risk categories based principally on the degree of credit risk associated with the obligor 
the assets and off balance sheet items in the four risk categories are weighted at   and 
these computations result in the total risk weighted assets 
the risk based capital regulations require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of  with at least as core capital 
for the purpose of calculating these ratios  i supplementary capital is limited to no more than of core capital  and ii the aggregate amount of certain types of supplementary capital is limited 
in addition  the risk based capital regulations limit the allowance for loan and lease losses which may be included as capital to of total risk weighted assets 
at december   the company s total risk based capital and leverage capital ratios were and  respectively 
the minimum level established by the regulators for these measures are and  respectively 
fdicia requires federal banking regulators to classify insured depository institutions by capital levels and to take various prompt corrective actions to resolve the problems of any institution that fails to satisfy the capital standards 
under fdicia and its prompt corrective action regulations  all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements 
under the fdic s prompt corrective action regulation  a well capitalized bank is one that is not subject to any regulatory order or directive to meet any specific capital level and that has or exceeds the following capital levels a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a leverage ratio of 
an adequately capitalized bank is one that does not qualify as well capitalized but meets or exceeds the following capital requirements a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a leverage ratio of either or if the bank has the highest composite examination rating 
a bank not meeting these criteria will be treated as undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized depending on the extent to which the bank s capital levels are below these standards 
a bank falling within any of the three undercapitalized categories will be subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator and other restrictions 
effect of government monetary policies  possible further legislation the company s earnings are and will be affected by domestic and international economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and foreign governments and their agencies 
the federal reserve s monetary policies have had  and will probably continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order  among other things  to curb inflation or combat a recession 
the federal reserve has a major effect on the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of  among other things  the discount rate on borrowings of banks and the imposition of nonearning reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
from time to time  proposals are made in the united states congress  the new jersey legislature and various bank regulatory authorities that would alter the powers of  and place restrictions on  different types of banking organizations 
it is impossible to predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted and any impact of such adoption on the business of the company and or the bank subsidiaries 
the bank subsidiaries are also subject to various federal and state laws such as usury laws and consumer protection laws 
employees as of december   the company employed a total of approximately employees  including full time employees 
management considers relations with employees to be satisfactory 
item properties the company does not directly own or lease any land  buildings or equipment 
however  the company s nonbank subsidiary  realty  owns a property in bergen county  new jersey 
gcb owns two properties in passaic county  new jersey and bcb owns two properties in bergen county  new jersey
