item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a seller of spoken audio and nostalgia products  including audiobooks and old time radio shows  through direct response  retail and internet channels 
our content and products are sold in multiple formats  including physical cassette and compact disc and secure digital download formats 
we report financial results on the basis of four business segments  corporate  audio book club  radio spirits and mediabay 
com 
a fifth division  radioclassics  is aggregated with radio spirits for financial reporting purposes 
except for corporate  each segment serves a unique market segment within the spoken word audio industry 
in  our audio book club segment had net sales of approximately million  our radio spirits segment had net sales of approximately million  our mediabay 
com segment had sales of approximately million and we had eliminating inter segment sales of million 
we derive our principal revenue through sales of audiobooks  classic radio shows and other spoken word audio products directly to consumers principally through direct mail 
we also sell classic radio shows to retailers either directly or through distributors 
we derive additional revenue through rental of our proprietary database of names and addresses to non competing third parties through list rental brokers 
we also derive a small amount of revenue from advertisers who advertise on our nationally syndicated classic radio shows 
our business is dependent on attracting and retaining members in audio book club 
we continually monitor the cost to acquire new members  their buying behavior and the attrition rate of members 
any changes to these metrics could have a significant impact on our business 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements through sales of equity and debt securities and borrowings from financial institutions and our principal shareholders 
during  we did not have sufficient cash to undertake marketing activities to the extent of historical levels 
as a result  our member and customer bases eroded and our revenues declined significantly 
we currently do not have sufficient funds to market to attract new members and customers to maintain our member and customer bases 
we will require additional financing to conduct sufficient marketing activities to maintain and rebuild our member and customer bases 
if we do not obtain the funds necessary to increase our advertising to acquire new members to offset member attrition and or expand our existing membership and customer bases  our revenue will continue to decline  which will continue to negatively impact our performance and could ultimately impair our ability to continue as a going concern 
we also have significant outstanding indebtedness and face substantial debt repayment obligations in the short term 
our line of credit  of million as of april   is due september   an additional million is due upon demand of the holders of notes which may be made at various times during following the repayment of the line of credit and an additional million under promissory notes is due in the fourth quarter of we currently do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt as it will become due and are actively seeking to obtain other financing to replace the debt or obtain an extension of the maturities 
we have implemented a series of initiatives to increase cash flow 
while these initiatives and the significant reduction in marketing expenses increased cash provided by operating activities in  we cannot sustain our operations without increasing marketing expenses 
we require additional financing to repay debt  as described above  and to fund the maintenance of our operations  working capital or other related uses 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we record reductions to our revenues for future returns and record an estimate of future bad debts arising from current sales in general and administrative expenses 
these allowances are based upon historical experience and evaluation of current trends 
if the financial condition of our customers  including either individual consumers or retail chains  were to deteriorate or if the payment behavior were to change  resulting in either their inability or refusal to make payment to us  additional allowances would be required 
we capitalize direct response marketing costs for the acquisition of new members and amortize these costs over the period of probable future benefits 
in order to determine the amount of advertising to be capitalized and the manner and period over which the advertising should be amortized  we prepare estimates of probable future revenues arising from the direct response advertising in excess of future costs to be incurred in realizing those revenues 
we record an estimate of our anticipated bad debt expense based on our historical experience 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary timing differences become deductible 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  management has determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
in  the deferred tax asset was reduced by approximately million for amounts  which we were unable to determine would be recoverable in future periods 
we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  in connection with the annual budgeting and planning process  which did not result in an impairment loss 
however  if conditions or circumstances were to change resulting in a deterioration of our radio spirits business  a future impairment of goodwill could be necessary 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  the carrying value and net realizable value of inventories  the recoverability of advances to publishers and other rightsholders  the future revenue associated with deferred advertising and promotion costs  investments  fixed assets  the valuation allowance provided to reduce our deferred tax assets and valuation of goodwill and other intangibles 
the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however the following policies are considered to be critical within the sec definition revenue recognition we derive our principal revenue through sales of audiobooks  classic radio shows and other spoken word audio products directly to consumers principally through direct mail 
we also sell classic radio shows to retailers either directly or through distributors 
we derive additional revenue through rental of our proprietary database of names and addresses to non competing third parties through list rental brokers 
we also derive a small amount of revenue from advertisers included in our nationally syndicated classic radio shows 
we recognize sales to consumers  retailers and distributors upon shipment of merchandise 
list rental revenue is recognized on notification by the list brokers of rental by a third party when the lists are rented 
we recognize advertising revenue upon notification of the airing of the advertisement by the media buying company representing us 
allowances for future returns are based upon historical experience and evaluation of current trends 
the historical return rates for abc members have been consistent for the past year and our estimate is based on a detailed historical examination of trends 
based on the current performance and historical trends  we do not expect significant changes in the estimate of returns for abc members 
the estimate of returns for wholesale sales of our old time radio products is based on a detailed review of each significant customer  depending on the amount of products sold to a particular customer in a specific periods  the overall return rate for wholesale sales could vary 
we record reductions to our revenue for future returns and record an estimate of future bad debts arising from current sales in general and administrative expenses 
these allowances are based upon historical experience and evaluation of current trends 
if members and customers return products to us in the future at higher rates than in the past or than we currently anticipate  our net sales would be reduced and our operating results would be adversely affected 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  which addresses the income statement classification of certain credits  allowances  adjustments  and payments given to customers for the services or benefits provided 
we adopted eitf no 
effective january   and  as such  have classified the cost of these sales incentives as a reduction of sales 
the effect on sales of applying eitf no 
in and was  and  respectively 
deferred member acquisition costs we are required to capitalize direct response marketing costs for the acquisition of new members in accordance with aicpa statement of position reporting on advertising costs and amortize these costs over the period of probable future benefits 
in order to determine the amount of advertising to be capitalized and the manner and period over which the advertising should be amortized  we prepare estimates of probable future revenues arising from the direct response advertising in excess of future costs to be incurred in realizing those revenues 
if future revenue does not meet our estimates or if members buying patterns were to shift  adjustments to the amount and manner of amortization would be required 
at december  we had deferred member acquisition costs of million  which is being amortized over eighteen and thirty month periods 
we have tracked customer buying behavior and believe that the estimates we have used to amortize abc advertising have been consistent and we do not expect to see significant changes 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the amortization period for advertising to attract customers to our world s greatest old time radio continuity program and have revised the estimate period for amortization of these advertising costs down to months  which resulted in and increase in advertising expenses for the year ended december  of  accounts receivable valuation we record an estimate of our anticipated bad debt expense and return rates based on our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers  including either individual consumers or retail chains  were to deteriorate  or if the payment or buying behavior were to change  resulting in either their inability or refusal to make payment to us  additional allowances would be required 
for example  a one percent increase in returns as a percentage of gross sales for the year ended  assuming a constant gross profit percentage and all other expenses unchanged  would have resulted in a decrease in net sales of  and a increase in net loss available to common shares of  a one percent increase in bad debt expenses as a percentage of net sales  assuming all other expenses were unchanged  would have resulted in an increase in bad debt expenses and a corresponding increase in net loss available to common shares of  our estimate of bad debt expenses in was adjusted upward due to the poor paying performance of abc members attracted through internet offers  which did not require an upfront payment and members of audio passages  our audiobook club with predominantly christian content whose members also demonstrated poor paying performance 
our internet advertising currently requires payment with a credit card of the initial order and will continue to require a credit card until we develop better credit screening methods 
we have discontinued the audio passages marketing program 
income taxes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary timing differences become deductible 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  we have determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
we determine the utilization of deferred tax assets in the future based on our current year projections of future periods 

in  the deferred tax asset was reduced by approximately million for amounts  which we were unable to determine would be recoverable in future periods 
at december   we have a remaining net deferred tax asset in the amount of million 
should we determine we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be recorded as an increase to the valuation allowance  resulting in a deferred tax expense charged against income in the period such determination is made 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
at december   we had million of goodwill  all of which relates to our radio spirits operations 
we completed our annual impairment test as of october  in connection with the annual budgeting and planning process  which did not result in an impairment loss 
however  if conditions or circumstances were to change resulting in a deterioration of our radio spirits business  a future impairment of goodwill could be necessary

as the chart below indicates  we attempted to grow our audio book club very aggressively in we spent million to attract new members to our audio book club in 
bar chart omitted 
the largest increases in as compared to were in attracting members through the internet to our audio book club in offers which required no immediate payment to join the club or purchase the initial books bill me members and in attracting member to audio passages  an audiobook club with products intended for a christian audience 
the cost to acquire these customers was lower than our traditional direct mail campaigns to acquire audio book club members  however the performance of both the members attracted through the internet and the audio passages members was much worse than our traditional audio book club members 
because we spent a substantial amount of money to acquire these members and their performances were worse than we anticipated  we did not have much funds for advertising in and accordingly our advertising and promotion activities were dramatically reduced in a large portion of advertising expenditures in was capitalized and a substantial portion of that advertising was expensed in as the chart indicates our new member recruitment was significantly reduced in in  we have done a small amount of marketing for new abc members on an internet offer requiring credit card payment 
while the initial response was encouraging we continue to monitor the buying and payment behavior of these customers and currently do not have sufficient funds to conduct any additional marketing

com bad debt expense at audio book club increased by 
million to million  or of sales 
the principal reason for the increase in bad debt expense at audio book club was the attraction of over  members through the internet  most of which were bill me members 
the bad debt rates for the initial discounted offer to these bill me internet members often exceeded and the bad debt rate for shipments subsequent to payment for the initial offer exceeded the historical bad debt rate of the audio book club acquired through direct mail 
we stopped offering bill me offers on the internet in the second quarter of and are testing alternatives methods to attract members either through an offer requiring immediate payment of the initial offer with a credit card or much more extensive initial screening methods

the reduction in product costs is due to better buying  combined purchasing at both audio book club and radio spirits and revisions in the mix of products and packaging at both audio book club and radio spirits 
advertising and promotion expenses for the year ended december  were million 
advertising and promotion expenses for the year ended december  were million of which  million represented write downs to deferred member acquisition costs 
the decrease in reported advertising costs is principally due to lower expenditures relating to audio book club new member acquisitions in as compared to and the write down of deferred member acquisition costs in the third quarter of which resulted in lower amortization of new member acquisition costs in and thus lower reported advertising expense in general and administrative expenses decreased 
million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior comparable period

the amount of goodwill amortized during the year ended december  was

based on our review for goodwill impairment in  the company did not recognize any goodwill impairment in in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reviewed the carrying amounts of our intangible assets and determined  based on decisions made in the fourth quarter of  that the value of certain intangible assets could no longer be supported by anticipated future operations 
specifically  the company made a strategic decision to no longer compete in the dvd market and accordingly wrote off the value of certain video and dvd rights it had acquired in the amount of  we also made the strategic decision in the fourth quarter of to discontinue future mailings to the columbia house lists of members of other clubs 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off the unamortized value of the columbia house mailing agreement of  interest expense for the year ended december  was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  included in interest expense is the amortization of debt discount resulting from the issuance of warrants and beneficial conversion features related to certain of our financings 
the amount amortized was 
million and 
million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net loss before income taxes for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss before income taxes for the year ended december  of million 
as a result of the series of strategic initiatives described above  our operations had improved 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  we determined in  based on our improved operations  that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
accordingly we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the amount of million and recorded an income tax benefit 
during then year ended december   we utilized  of the million deferred tax asset recorded in accordingly  we recorded an income tax expense of  we accrued preferred stock dividends of million on the outstanding  shares of series a preferred stock  which were issued in january net loss applicable to common shares for the year ended december  was million  or 
per diluted share of common stock as compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share of common stock for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our cash requirements through sales of our equity and debt securities and borrowings from financial institutions and our principal shareholders 
during  we did not have sufficient cash to undertake marketing activities to the extent of historical levels 
for the year ended december   we spent million to attract new audio book club members  a reduction of million  or  from the amount spent to attract new members of million during the year ended december   principally due to the lack of necessary funds 
as a result  our member and customer bases eroded and our revenues declined significantly 
we currently do not have sufficient funds to market to attract new members and customers to maintain our member and customer bases and have conducted only minimal tests of new internet marketing initiatives in we will require additional financing to conduct sufficient marketing activities to maintain and rebuild our member and customer bases 
if we do not obtain the funds necessary to increase our advertising to acquire new members to offset member attrition and or expand our existing membership and customer bases  our revenue will continue to decline  which will continue to negatively impact our performance and could ultimately impair our ability to continue as a going concern 
our revolving line of credit matures on september   an additional million is due upon demand of the holders of notes which may be made at various times during following the repayment of the line of credit and an additional million under promissory notes is due in the fourth quarter of we are required to make monthly payments of principal on the line of credit of  in february through august we currently do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt as it becomes due and are actively seeking to obtain other financing to replace the debt or obtain an extension of the maturities 
if we do not have the necessary extensions or replacement financings  we will be in default on our indebtedness 
operating activities we have implemented a series of initiatives to increase cash flow 
while these initiatives and the significant reduction in marketing expenses increased cash provided by operating activities in  we cannot sustain our operations without increasing marketing expenses 
we require additional financing to repay debt and to fund the maintenance of operations  working capital or other related uses 
without additional capital  we do not have the funds to meet our short term needs 
we are currently exploring a number of alternatives  including raising additional debt or equity  refinancing or extending our existing debt and selling certain assets to fund our long and short term needs 
for the year ended december   our cash increased by 
million  as we had cash provided by operating activities of million and we had cash used in investing activities of 
million and in financing activities of million 
during  we generated cash from operations of million  including the repayment of accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
this increase in cash from operations was due to principally to our reducing new member marketing dramatically in as compared to net cash provided by operating activities principally consisted of our net loss applicable to common shares of million  decreased by depreciation and amortization expenses of 
million  amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount of 
million  non current accrued interest and dividends payable million  write offs of assets related to a terminated marketing program of 
million  income tax expense of million  stock related non cash compensation of 
million  decreases in accounts receivable  inventory  royalty advances and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  
million  
million and 
million  respectively and a net reduction in deferred member acquisition costs of million 
net cash provided by operations was reduced by reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is principally due to reduced sales at both our audio book club and our wholesale radio spirits sales 
we also have reserved bad debts based on our experience in  which was much higher than in previous years  due to the significant increase in of abc members recruited in bill me offers from the internet and audio passages members 
we have discontinued internet bill me offers until we have tested new credit screening methods and have discontinued our audio passages audiobook club 
we believe that these steps will assist us in reducing our bad debt rate 
the reduction in inventory is a result of lower sales  which require less inventory and the aggressive sale of slower moving items old time radio products at heavily discounted prices in remainder sales 
we have also provided a reserve for obsolescence for our audio passages product because of our discontinuing the operation 
the decrease in royalty advances is principally due to increased royalty expenses  since we sold less new member units  the audiobooks we sold were at higher royalty rates and we also reserved 
million for advances we do not expect to recover principally due to lower sales at audio book club due to fewer members 
the decrease in prepaid expenses was principally the result of not mailing a direct mail campaign to acquire new members in our audio book club in december or january the decrease net deferred member acquisition costs is directly related to the substantial reduction in new member advertising 
we used substantially all of the cash generated from operations to reduce accounts payable resulting in a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million during the year ended december  investing activities cash used in investing activities was for the acquisition of fixed assets of million  principally computer equipment  and remaining payments of million to great american audio for the acquisition of certain of great american audio assets including the license to the shadow programs 
financing activities during the year ended december   we repaid million under our senior credit facility and the maturity of the senior credit facility was extended to september   subject to monthly principals payments of  through august on may   we sold  shares of a newly created series b stock with a liquidation preference of per share for  of the total sold   shares  were purchased by carl wolf  chairman and a director of mediabay  and shares  were purchased by john levy  executive vice president and chief financial officer of mediabay 
the holders of shares of series b stock are entitled to receive dividends at the rate of per share  payable quarterly  in arrears  in cash on each march  june  september and december  provided that payment will accrue until we are permitted to make such payment in cash under the credit agreement 
the series b stock is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion rate equal to a fraction  i the numerator of which is equal to the number of series b stock times plus accrued and unpaid dividends though the date of conversion and ii the denominator is the 
in the event of a liquidation  dissolution or winding up of mediabay  the holders of series b stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of mediabay  a sum in cash equal to per share before any amounts are paid to the holders of mediabay common stock and on a pari passu with the holders of the series a preferred stock 
the holders of series b stock shall have no voting rights  except as required by law and except that the vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of series b stock  voting separately as a class  will be required for any amendment  alteration or repeal of the terms of the series b stock that adversely effects the rights  preferences or privileges of the series b stock 
on june   abc entered into a settlement agreement with respect to a lawsuit in which abc was the plaintiff and arising out of an acquisition made by abc 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  abc received  in cash  the return for cancellation of  shares of mediabay common stock issued in connection with the acquisition and the termination of put rights granted to the seller in the acquisition with respect to  of the shares put rights with respect to the remaining  shares had previously terminated 
the termination of the puts rights terminated a million future contingent obligation of mediabay and results in a corresponding increase in stockholders equity 
the calculation of the settlement of litigation is as follows termination of contingent put rights  return for cancellation of  shares of common stock  legal and other costs incurred in connection with the litigation  net of cash received of  net settlement of litigation recorded in contributed capital  on october   we completed a  financing consisting of the notes due october  the notes bear interest at  provide for accrual of interest to maturity and have no prepayment penalty 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we issued to the investors  five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of

an entity is subject to fin and is called a variable interest entity vie if it has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity 
all other entities are evaluated for consolidation under sfas no

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas provides guidance on classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
we reclassified certain items to debt as a result of the sfas net operating losses our federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in under section of the internal revenue code of  utilization of prior net operating losses is limited after an ownership change  as defined in section  to an annual amount equal to the value of the corporation s outstanding stock immediately before the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
the additional equity financing we obtained in may result in an ownership change and  thus  may limit our use of our prior net operating losses 
in the event we achieve profitable operations  any significant limitation on the utilization of net operating losses would have the effect of increasing our tax liability and reducing net income and available cash reserves 
we are unable to determine the availability of net operating losses since this availability is dependent upon profitable operations  which we have not achieved in prior periods 
we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net operating loss carryforwards
