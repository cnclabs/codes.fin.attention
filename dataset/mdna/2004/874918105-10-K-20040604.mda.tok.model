item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements and other financial information included in this form k for the year ended march overview we are the leading provider of automated employment and income verification and unemployment cost management services and a leader in providing human resources payroll business process outsourcing 
our services use web access  interactive voice response  fax and other technologies to enable mortgage lenders  pre employment screening companies  employees  employers and other authorized users to obtain employee human resources and payroll information and allow employees and their managers to review and modify information in the human resources and payroll management information systems on a self service basis 
further  we provide unemployment insurance claims processing and unemployment tax planning and management services to a broad range of employers 
we typically serve large organizations  including approximately two thirds of fortune companies and a number of federal  state and local government agencies 
our strategy is to position talx with a suite of services that either deliver or use payroll data 
we describe these services as payroll data centric  and we believe that we are well positioned in the market with those capabilities 
we interact with various payroll systems and payroll services  but are virtually independent of the payroll solutions our clients select 
we believe fiscal was a successful year in spite of mixed economic conditions 
we continued to execute our payroll centric strategy and consolidate our acquisitions  thereby delivering value to our shareholders 
most importantly  we were able to capitalize on our cross selling opportunities  strengthening customer relationships  particularly by introducing the unemployment cost management client base to additional talx capabilities 
our earnings from continuing operations increased percent to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for fiscal revenues rose percent to million from million 
the work number services closed out the year with a record quarter for revenues 
for the year  this business generated revenue growth of percent  attributable in part to the continued broadening of our verifier base  expanding transactions beyond mortgage and refinancing activity 
during the year we have increased transaction levels in other markets such as pre employment screening  finance  collections and social services 
additionally  the fiscal gross margin for this business improved basis points to percent from percent the year before 
much of that improvement resulted from the increased use of cost effective web based programs to deliver employment verification  time reporting and electronic payroll services 
the total number of employment records on the work number services increased to million at march  from million a year ago  representing an percent gain 
total employment records under contract  including those in contract backlog to be added to the database  increased percent to million at march  from million a year earlier 
overall uncertain economic conditions contributed to a decline in fiscal revenues in the unemployment cost management services business 
this business experienced a slowdown in activity within the tax consulting unit and lower overall claims volumes  which limited the ability to generate additional revenues over contracted limits 
while the revenue levels were not up to our expectations  the addition of the unemployment cost management business has been an important contributor to our overall profitability as well as to the growth in the work number services  resulting from selling those services to our unemployment cost management services client base 
gross margin in the unemployment cost management business remained consistent at percent for the fiscal year compared to percent in the prior year 
with the operational integration substantially complete  we are now realizing cost savings 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we experienced our second sequential quarter of gross margin improvement in the unemployment cost management services business and we expect this improvement to continue in fiscal through new and ongoing process improvement initiatives 
pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated march   effective april   we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of the unemployment compensation  employment verification and pre applicant screening businesses of sheakley uniservice  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  sheakley interactive services  llc 
the acquired businesses provide unemployment cost management services  employment verification services and pre applicant screening services to a broad customer base 
this business will continue to operate through our wholly owned subsidiary  talx employer services  llc 
total revenues for these businesses were approximately million for calendar year the purchase price was approximately million  including transaction costs  and was paid in cash  which was financed  as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the asset purchase agreement requires sheakley uniservice  inc and sheakley interactive services  llc to indemnify us for certain pre closing liabilities and obligations of the business  subject to certain limitations 
an escrow account  to be maintained by a bank pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement  is also available until march  to satisfy the indemnification obligations of sheakley uniservice  inc and sheakley interactive services  llc under the asset purchase agreement  subject to certain limitations described in the asset purchase agreement 
for such purposes  million dollars of the purchase price was paid into the escrow account 
in connection with the asset purchase agreement  the parties executed a transition services agreement under which sheakley uniservice  inc will provide certain services to us for up to two years 
the services are intended to provide for the orderly transition of the acquired businesses and the employees of such businesses from sheakley uniservice  inc and sheakley interactive services  llc to us 
on april  we transferred substantially all of the assets of our human resources and benefits application services business to workscape  inc  a framingham  massachusetts based provider of benefits and workforce management solutions 
the primary product of this line of services  the benefits enrollment business  provides a customized solution for clients employees to enroll in an employer s benefits programs and make changes to their personal information and benefits elections  all by means of the internet or by telephone 
workscape  inc hired all of the employees directly related to the benefits enrollment business 
the transaction was structured as a transfer of assets under contract for sale with no initial down payment and the purchase price to be paid over a three year period  based on a client retention formula 
proceeds are anticipated to be between million and million 
while the contract did not specify a minimum guaranteed amount  we secured a million note from workscape  inc and as of june  we had received million of principal and  of interest payments in connection with the note 
all assets and liabilities of this business  both the portion of the business transferred under contract to workscape  inc approximately of the assets and the portion that has not yet been sold  along with related transaction costs  were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as net assets of business held for sale 
we recorded cash received under the asset purchase agreement first to reduce the recorded value of net assets of business held for sale and then to reflect gain on the sale of the business 
in connection with the transfer  we are providing workscape  inc  for agreed upon fees  with various transition services related to the operation of the benefits enrollment business until december   or until certain transferred client contracts have expired or been terminated 
these fees  offset by costs to deliver the service  were recorded first to reduce the recorded value of net assets of business held for sale and then to reflect gain on the sale of the business 
the historical results of operations for this business have been reclassified to earnings from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of earnings 
restatements of financial statements restatement in january  we restated certain historical financial statements as a result of adjustments related to our customer premises systems business 
the restatement was necessary because an internal accounting review in the third quarter of fiscal year showed that certain revenues for customer premises systems contracts were recorded earlier than was appropriate under the percentage of completion methodology used for this line of business 
although we ultimately realized the revenues from the transactions under review  our financial results were not accurately presented  requiring the restatement 
the resulting restatement affected fiscal years ended march  through and the first two quarters of fiscal year additionally  we corrected three errors related to bill and hold arrangements on hardware and software transactions arising out of the customer premises systems line of business during the fiscal years ended march  and these adjustments resulted in movements of revenue and related costs between quarters for each year 
there was no impact to the annual financial results of either fiscal year 
the restatement had practically no cumulative impact on our financial results or our financial condition 
it had the effect of reducing revenues by  for fiscal years  and and increasing revenues by a similar amount in fiscal years and the impact on the fiscal years presented   and  was a reduction of revenue in of  and an increase of revenues in and of  and  respectively 
in addition to the revenue adjustments  the related commissions associated with the revenues were adjusted accordingly and the income taxes provisions were amended to reflect the impact of these restatements 
the annual impact to diluted earnings per share was a reduction to fiscal year of  an increase to fiscal year of  a reduction to fiscal year of and increases to fiscal years and of and  respectively 
our review focused on contracts in which revenue was realized in fiscal and subsequent periods as reliable historical data was not available for earlier periods 
accordingly  our review included contracts for which services were initiated in periods prior to fiscal the review of certain contracts resulted in cumulative adjustments for periods prior to fiscal which have been attributed to fiscal  the earliest fiscal period presented for financial disclosure purposes 
while it is possible that certain of these adjustments related to periods prior to fiscal  data was not available to accurately support the specific allocation to such prior periods 
such data was not available as we had modified our systems during fiscal and have not retained sufficient comparable data for contracts entered into prior to the modification 
while further review may have resulted in adjustments to increase revenue in by decreasing revenues in prior periods  based on the review performed  management believes that further adjustments were not supportable 
the adjustments also impacted our consolidated balance sheet based on the respective revenue amounts  resulting in a restatement of our work in progress and deferred revenues 
in addition  accrued expenses were restated to give effect to the impact on accrued commissions  and deferred income taxes were restated for the related tax effect 
see our form k a for the fiscal year ending march  regarding the impact of our prior restatement on our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets 
the prior restatement had no impact on our total cash flows from operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
restatement in response to inquiries made by the securities and exchange commission during the course of its investigation  we reviewed  during our december quarter  the accounting treatment for two items in the year ended march  in december  we subsequently restated certain of our previously issued financial statements 
the two items reviewed were the accounting for a patent technology license agreement and the award of certain bonus payments to the executive officers 
the million paid in connection with the patent technology license entered into with ronald a 
katz technology licensing  lp and ad  lp in march had been recorded as an intangible asset and was being amortized over a year period 
we decided to expense the entire amount in the march quarter 
certain bonus payments to the executive officers  recommended by the compensation committee and approved by the board of directors on may   totaling approximately  had been reflected as an expense related to the quarter ended june  we decided to record the entire expense in the quarter ended march  the effect of these restatements on the consolidated statement of earnings was to reduce earnings for the year ended march  by million  after income tax  and to increase earnings over the following year period by the same dollar amount in the aggregate 
see our form k a for the fiscal year ending march  regarding the impact of our prior restatement on our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets 
the prior restatement had no impact on our total cash flows from operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  capitalized software and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies include our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from the work number are recognized in the period that they are earned  from transaction fees charged to users for verifications of employment history and income 
additionally  revenue for set up fees  monthly maintenance and employer conversion fees are recognized on a straight line basis from the time the service is available to be used by our clients through the end of the service period 
revenues from our unemployment cost management services  called uc express  are recognized in the period that they are earned  evenly over the life of the contract 
transaction fees are recorded as the services are provided 
revenue which is contingent upon achieving certain performance criteria is recognized when those criteria are met 
revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
we recognize hardware and software license revenue upon shipment based on vendor specific objective evidence 
revenues for professional services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the professional services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts with fixed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when the project is complete 
deferred revenue represents the unearned portion of the work number setup fees  uc express and maintenance fees 
commissions are paid based upon successful efforts and are deferred and expensed over the related service period 
business combinations and intangible asset valuation in connection with the acquisitions of ti  inc  the unemployment cost management services business of gates  mcdonald company  a subsidiary of nationwide mutual insurance company  and james e 
frick  inc  d b a the frick company  talx acquired certain identifiable intangible assets 
these assets were recorded in accordance with the financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 business combinations 
pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated march   effective april   we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of the unemployment compensation  employment verification and pre applicant screening businesses of sheakley uniservice  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  sheakley interactive services  llc 
these assets will be recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
effective april   we have adopted the financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
through the use of an independent business appraiser  we reviewed our goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and determined that no impairment existed 
capitalized software software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is achieved  after which time they are capitalized on a product by product basis 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  generally three years 
amortization of capitalized software development costs starts when the product is available for general release to clients 
all capitalized software assets are reviewed as of each balance sheet date for impairment 
upon determination of any impairment  the asset is written down to the appropriate value in the period that the impairment is determined 
income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
if management were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against earnings in the period such determination was made 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

accordingly  the historical results of operations for this business have been reclassified to earnings from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of earnings 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal years ended march  and revenues 
years ended march  in thousands the work number services    unemployment cost management services   customer premises systems   maintenance and support    total revenues    total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues from the work number services increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase is due primarily to an increase in transaction volume resulting from marketing efforts directed to verifiers and employers  partially offset by lower average transaction fees due to the increase in transactions from users with volume pricing discounts and the impact of former users moving to other means of access 
also  we experienced increased transaction volumes due to an increase in the number of employers and related employment records in the database 
the mortgage industry and pre employment screeners are the two primary revenue generators for the work number 
the balance between mortgage related and pre employment related verification revenues began to shift back from its widest spread in the first quarter of fiscal towards a more traditional balance towards the end of fiscal additionally  during fiscal we gradually increased revenues from collection companies and social services agencies 
the table below indicates the percentage of the work number revenues contributed by types of verifiers during fiscal year and fiscal year quarters ended june  sept

 march  verifier pre employment mortgage finance collections social services other as of the end of fiscal year  we had million records live on the service  an increase from fiscal year our live and backlog accounts represented million records 
revenues from the paperless pay and fastime services increased during fiscal year and we expect they will continue to grow in fiscal year as several large clients are coming on line 
new contracts signed during fiscal year contributed to a growth in fiscal year fastime revenues on a year over year basis 
in paperless pay  both contracted business and the sales pipeline gained momentum and current indications lead us to believe that the revenue run rate could double in this service over the next six to nine months 
this business generated revenue growth for fiscal surveys of major employers indicate that many are focused on eliminating pay stubs and paper checks and replacing them with web based pay statements and pay cards 
we believe we are well positioned to play a key role in that trend 
our w express services also experienced a strong year 
we had over million w s live on our system for fiscal  representing an increase in excess of over fiscal revenues from unemployment cost management services ucexpress decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to a reduced level of tax consulting contracts  some pricing pressure in the claims processing business and the loss of some smaller clients last year as we instituted certain minimum pricing policies  partially offset by the addition of revenues from our acquisition of johnson and associates and new sales 
the uc express revenue stream is one of multi year contracts that provide a solid revenue base with upside potential through contingency billings from tax consulting or through additional billings if claims processed  or other performance measures  exceed contractually set levels 
during the fiscal year  uncertain economic conditions contributed to a reduction in activity in our tax consulting business 
in addition  claims activity was less than expected and we did not realize the anticipated additional billings 
revenues from customer premises systems decreased in fiscal as we have been diminishing this business over the past several years 
during fiscal we completely eliminated sales of customer premises systems 
revenues from maintenance and support related to the customer premises systems increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase was due to additional revenue generated through services provided to clients that were outside of our standard maintenance agreements 
the increase was partially offset by lower standard maintenance revenues caused by a shrinking client base 
we anticipate maintenance and support revenues will decrease over time from current levels as our installed base continues to shrink as supported systems approach the end of their life cycles 
additionally  during  we notified our maintenance clients of our intention to discontinue all support services effective june gross margin

the unemployment cost management services business has been an important contributor to our overall profitability as well as to the growth in the work number services due to success in cross selling the work number services into the unemployment cost management services client base 
the work number services gross margin increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of corresponding revenue  gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in gross margin and gross margin percentage were due primarily to higher revenue levels as discussed above and improved leveraging of our operational infrastructure 
additionally  more transactions were performed over the internet  which has a lower average transaction cost compared to transactions performed through either our or telephone services 
unemployment cost management services gross margin decreased to million  or of corresponding revenue  in fiscal from million  or of corresponding revenue  in fiscal this decrease in gross margin and gross margin percentage is due primarily to temporary incremental costs related to our efforts to consolidate the ucexpress operational infrastructure during the first half of the year 
our efforts to consolidate our operational infrastructure were substantially concluded in the second half of fiscal  and we began to realize cost savings 
we expect to see our margins improve as we continue to identify and implement process improvement initiatives 
maintenance and support gross margin decreased to million from million in fiscal and as a percentage of corresponding revenue  gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal these decreases are due to the fixed nature of personnel and infrastructure costs even as our installed base continues to shrink 
also  we incurred incremental personnel costs related to providing services outside of our standard maintenance agreements 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  such expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal these increases are due to increased costs related to our recent reorganization of the sales and services teams 
in addition to realigning our sales and service teams into regions  we added personnel and related costs 
additionally  marketing costs increased in fiscal as we increased our efforts to market to high volume verifiers of the work number 
the significant increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to the addition of sales and marketing personnel and related costs from our march acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in such expenses reflects the increased infrastructure costs of a growing business and workforce 
as a percentage of revenues  such expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to improved leveraging of personnel and infrastructure costs 
also  we experienced cost savings as we consolidated certain back office functions related to our acquisitions from march the significant increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to the addition of general and administrative costs from our march acquisitions 
although the majority of legal costs incurred in relation to our class action lawsuits and sec investigation have been paid by our insurance carriers  certain legal costs in addition to accounting costs and severance costs related to these matters have been expensed during fiscal years and we expect certain of these costs to continue  and possibly increase  in fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net totaled  of other expense in fiscal compared to million of other expense in fiscal and million of other income in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to a shift from a net investing position to a net borrowing position as we entered into a new credit facility to finance our march acquisitions 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to a lower level of outstanding borrowings throughout fiscal compared to fiscal restructuring and other charges 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we reorganized our sales and delivery operations and refocused our product lines related to our human resources and benefit applications and customer premises systems businesses 
in conjunction with the reorganization  we reduced our workforce by approximately  closed certain regional sales offices and wrote down hardware inventory and capitalized software 
as a result of these actions  we incurred restructuring charges of million associated with the write off of capitalized software   related to employee severance costs and  related to office closing costs 
these items are reflected in the line item restructuring charge on the consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year 
additionally  we incurred a charge of  related to the write down of certain hardware inventory items 
this charge is reflected as a separate component of cost of revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year 
there are no remaining liabilities at march  related to the reorganization 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
these increases are due principally to increases in our federal and state income tax rates 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth specified unaudited statement of operations data for each of the four quarters in fiscal and fiscal  the gross margin percentage for each of our revenue categories  and operating data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues

our revenues  margins and operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and quarterly basis  as a result of a number of factors  most of which are outside of our control  as discussed in item business risk factors our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
seasonality revenues generated from our w express service are particularly affected by seasonality and are principally earned in our fourth fiscal quarter 
revenues generated from our unemployment cost management services  which we acquired in late march  are generally higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as certain client contracts allow us to bill additional fees based upon actual annual claims volumes 
additionally  our tax planning business has an inherent seasonality based upon the general nature of tax services 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of march  payments by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations     capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     total     under certain circumstances  principal payments are required out of excess cash flow  as well as from the proceeds of certain asset dispositions and from the proceeds of the issuance of equity and debt by us

pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated as of march   with an effective date of april   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of the unemployment compensation  employment verification and pre applicant screening businesses collectively  the business of sheakley uniservice  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  sheakley interactive services  llc  for approximately million  including transaction costs  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
of the purchase price  million is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at march  as restricted cash  as payment was made on march   for an effective date of april  liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have financed our operations through cash flows from operating activities 
in addition to cash provided by operating activities  we have access to a revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to changes in the components of working capital and payments of current liabilities in fiscal  including payment on an accrual for transition services related to our march acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the funding of our million restricted cash position at march  related to the acquisition of the unemployment compensation  employment verification and pre applicant screening businesses of sheakley uniservice  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  sheakley interactive services  llc 
this acquisition was effective april  in fiscal  investing activities reflect the payment of million related to our march acquisitions 
other uses of cash for investing activities during fiscal included the acquisition of johnson and associates for million and capital expenditures  including capitalized software  of million 
these capital expenditures were principally for computer equipment and software 
at march   we had no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under facilities and operating leases  but would expect capital expenditures to increase during the next months as we integrate the operations of our new acquisition 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million provided by financing activities in fiscal compared to million used in financing activities in fiscal this change was primarily due to million new borrowings related to our sheakley acquisition 
uses of cash for financing activities during fiscal included scheduled debt retirement payments of million  the repurchase of stock for million and dividend payments of million 
our working capital increased to million at march  from million at march  this increase is primarily due to timing considerations related to the billing cycle 
at march  we had processed more billings with deferred revenue impact than at march  additionally  working capital at march  was negatively impacted by approximately million negative working capital related to assets sold as part of human resources and benefits application services business in april based on cash and cash equivalents on hand  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to pay our obligations as they become due  for at least the next months 
our business strategy contemplates that we will consider acquisitions from time to time 
we cannot assure you that we will make any such additional acquisitions or that any such acquisitions would be successful 
we expect that such acquisitions may require that we access additional credit 
as described below  our loan agreement will provide funding for certain possible future acquisitions subject to certain conditions

payments are due in equal quarterly amounts 
we may accelerate credit facility repayments  depending on available operating cash flow 
as a condition of the term loan agreement  we were required to enter into an interest rate swap for of our outstanding term loan as a means of reducing our interest rate exposure 
pursuant to this requirement  we entered into an interest rate swap contract on june  for a notional amount of million  which represented of our outstanding term loan balance on that date 
under this contract  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate of libor  which is equal to the libor rate utilized on our term loan 
the notional amount of our interest rate swap contract steps down according to the same schedule as our term loan 
all payment dates and maturity dates are the same as our term loan 
this strategy effectively converts a portion of our term loan into a fixed rate instrument 
the interest rate swap and related gains and losses arising on the contract are accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
specifically  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded in other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains or losses are recognized in income when the transactions being hedged are completed 
as discussed above  on march  we repaid our loan agreement and entered into a new loan agreement 
effective march  our existing interest rate swap was matched to our new loan agreement  and will remain until original maturity 
as of march   the fair value of the interest rate swap in the amount of  is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities

other matters we are cooperating with a pending sec investigation and are a defendant in pending lawsuits which are described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
on may  we reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle all pending class action lawsuits 
the settlement calls for payment of million  which will be made by our insurance carriers and will not impact earnings 
there were  however  approximately  of additional legal costs that were included in expenses for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as of the year ended march  we recorded a liability for million in accrued expenses and other liabilities representing the amount we owe under the settlement agreement 
additionally  we recorded million in prepaid expenses and other current assets representing the amount we will receive from our insurance companies 
the agreement is subject to certain conditions  including judicial approval  and a potential additional payment depending on the amount of certain claims 
we believe that any additional payment  if required  would not be material 
however  our expectations are subject to the risks that the court will not approve our class action settlement  that claimants request exclusion from the settlement that hold a larger than anticipated number of shares  or that the claims analysis on which we relied is inaccurate  and a larger than expected number of claims is submitted which could require us to make an additional payment 
on may   the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement and setting october  as the date for a hearing on final approval of the settlement 
in the interim  notice of the settlement will be given to class members  and they will have an opportunity to opt out or to file objections to the settlement 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation if the settlement is not approved by the court 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as previously disclosed  the securities and exchange commission initially commenced an investigation into our second fiscal quarter financial results 
we are cooperating fully with the investigation 
on november   the staff of the central regional office of the commission sent us a wells letter indicating the staff s plans to recommend to the commission that it institute an enforcement action against us and two of our executive officers  william canfield and craig cohen who has resigned from the company related to two matters  and requesting that we and such executive officers submit responses to the letter 
the wells letter states that the sec staff will allege  among other things  that our financial statements were misleading as a result of capitalizing instead of expensing million related to a patent technology license agreement executed in march and expensing approximately  in bonus payments to executive officers in the first quarter of fiscal instead of the fourth fiscal quarter of those items are among those that are the subject of our prior restatement  as disclosed in our form k a for the year ended march  we and the individuals have filed separate responses to the wells letter 
since the time of the wells submissions  the commission is continuing its investigation of our accounting for certain items  including those which were the subject of the restatements discussed below 
the remedies the commission may consider  if appropriate  include an injunction against us and the individuals and an officer and director bar and disgorgement and civil money penalties against us and or the individuals 
in the settlement of the civil suit referred to above  we released our insurance providers from related claims against our applicable insurance policies 
any fines or penalties assessed by the sec against us  along with any further defense costs incurred by us in connection with the sec investigation  either on our own behalf or as indemnification on behalf of william w 
canfield or craig n 
cohen  and any future related litigation will be borne by us and will not be covered by insurance 
in addition  to the extent that we are required to indemnify messrs 
canfield or cohen against any fines or penalties assessed against either of them  those amounts will be borne by us and not be covered by insurance 
the application of any of the foregoing remedies  or the commencement of any regulatory proceeding or enforcement action  could harm our business and financial condition 
as previously disclosed  we have filed restated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  through march  and for each of the first two quarters of fiscal in december  we filed restated financial statements for each of the quarters ended june  through june  and for the fiscal years ended march  and as a result of this new restatement  we could become subject to additional regulatory proceedings 
as required under our articles of incorporation  we are obligated to indemnify and advance expenses of each of the individual defendants  as officers and or directors of the company to the fullest extent permitted by missouri law  in connection with the above matters  subject to their obligations to repay amounts advanced under certain circumstances 
stifel  nicolaus company and ag edwards sons  inc have made demands on the company to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with these matters 
regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceeding  litigation and regulatory proceedings of these types are expensive and  until settled or otherwise resolved  will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend these proceedings 
in addition to matters set forth above  we are also party to other lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of conducting our business 
in the opinion of management  after taking into account recorded liabilities  the outcome of these other lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed above under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  our term loan and advances under our revolving credit facility bear interest at rates we select under the terms of the loan agreement  including a base rate or eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
as of march   we had million principal outstanding on our term loan  of which million was hedged with an interest rate swap contract 
on an annual basis  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate  change to our annual interest expense  based on net variable rate borrowings of million
