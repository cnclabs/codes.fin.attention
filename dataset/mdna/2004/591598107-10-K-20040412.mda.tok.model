item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
you should read this discussion along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the period ended december  we provide financial products and services to middle market consumers throughout the united states 
our consumer lending products are primarily unsecured credit cards  including the direct merchants bank mastercard r and visa r 
we also offer co branded credit cards through partnerships with other companies 
these credit card loans generate income and cash flow from principal  interest and fee payments 
additional cash flow is generated through the sale of our other consumer financial products  such as credit protection 
our target market is particularly susceptible to changes in the economy 
over the past few years  the status of the economy in the united states has led to increased unemployment rates  increased incidences of personal bankruptcy  and decreased consumer confidence  all of which have challenged the company and the middle market consumer loan industry 
in addition  in  we implemented a program to increase the credit lines to a large portion of our existing customers  which put increased payment pressure on those customers 
we continued to experience the residual effects of the economic downturn and the credit line increase program in as evidenced by our high charge off rates 
however  our primary focus continues to be on improving asset quality and we have taken several actions over the year to ensure this improvement  including strengthening credit line management strategies  limiting marketing efforts to better credit quality consumers  tightening credit authorization criteria and enhancing collection strategies 
we have started to see the results of our efforts with the metris master trust two cycle plus delinquency rates falling from their peak of in november to as of december  an additional key indicator of improvement is the recent performance of the metris master trust compared to the first half of the three month average excess spread as of december  was compared to for the quarter ended september   for the quarter ended june   and for the quarter ended march  the three month average excess spread was as of february  we continue to evaluate and modify our marketing programs to improve the overall credit quality of the managed portfolio 
beginning late in and continuing throughout  we tested pricing and line assignments for new customers 
these actions were in response to a lower interest rate environment  increased competition in the middle market sector and overall tightening of our underwriting 
the early results of these initiatives indicate improved credit quality from our most recent marketing campaigns 
we took several steps during to right size our business in order to properly position ourselves to execute our strategic plan 
we sold our membership club and warranty business in order to focus our resources on our core credit card loans business 
we reduced our managed portfolio using a combination of decreased marketing efforts  higher account attrition  and the sale of billion of credit card accounts in september and november we also have taken steps to match our workforce needs with the size of our portfolio by eliminating approximately  positions 
our business requires a high degree of liquidity 
thus  ensuring appropriate liquidity is  and will continue to be  at the forefront of our business objectives 
we rely heavily on the securitization of our consumer loans for funding  primarily by selling the loans to the metris master trust 
as of december   our funding needs for included billion in maturing asset backed financing and conduits in the metris master trust  million outstanding on our million term loan due in june  and million of senior notes due in november our strategies to meet these funding needs are portfolio attrition  the renewal or replacement of some of these facilities  new securitizations  and asset sales as necessary 
downgrades in our credit ratings and the historical deterioration in our asset quality have reduced our access to funding and have resulted in higher funding costs and less favorable terms than previously were available to us 
future downgrades in our debt ratings or those of direct merchants bank  or further deterioration in our asset quality  could continue to negatively impact our funding capabilities 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are identified on pages of this report  the most critical of which are our determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of our retained interests in loans securitized 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses results in a reserve approximating months of future charge offs for subprime receivables and months of future charge offs for prime receivables 
at the time of charge off  all principal balances are written off against the allowance and all fees and finance charges are netted against the applicable income statement line item 
the allowance is based on management s consideration of all relevant factors  including management s assessment of applicable economic and seasonal trends 
we segment the loan portfolio into several individual liquidating pools with similar credit risk characteristics and estimate based on historical experience for similar pools and existing environmental conditions the dollar amount of principal  accrued finance charges  and fees that will charge off 
we then aggregate these pools into prime and subprime portfolios based on the prescribed fico score cuts  credit counseling programs  and other differentiating receivable pools 
we also isolate other potentially higher risk segments such as accounts that are over their credit limit by more than  accounts in suspended status under our debt waiver benefits  and accounts in other programs as deemed necessary 
we separately analyze the reserve requirement on each of these groups or portfolios 
we continually evaluate the individual liquidating risk pools employing a roll rate model which uses historical delinquency levels and pay down levels months of historical data  with emphasis given to the last six months performance to capture current economic and seasonal trends  loan seasoning  and other measures of asset quality to estimate charge offs for both credit losses and bankruptcy losses 
additionally  in evaluating the adequacy of the loan loss reserves  we also consider several subjective factors which may be overlaid into the credit risk roll rate model in determining the necessary loan loss reserve  including national and economic trends and business conditions  including the condition of various market segments  changes in lending policies and procedures  including those for underwriting  collection  charge off and recovery  as well as the experience  ability and depth of our lending management staff  trends in volume and the product pricing of accounts  including any concentrations of credit  and impact from external factors  such as changes in competition  and legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
significant changes in these factors could impact our financial projections and thereby affect the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
valuation of retained interests in loans securitized the retained interests in loans securitized on our balance sheet associated with our securitization transactions includes contractual retained interests  transferor s interests  interest only strip receivable  and spread accounts receivable 
each of these components is described below 
we determine the fair value of each component of the retained interests in loans securitized at the time a securitization transaction or replenishment sale is completed using a discounted cash flow valuation model and on a quarterly basis thereafter 
any change in the fair value is recorded in securitization income 
the discounted cash flow valuation is limited to the receivables that exist and have been sold to the metris master trust 
therefore  the model assumes current principal receivable balances amortize with no new sales  interchange fees or cash advances 
the future cash flows are modeled in accordance with the debt series legal documents and are applied to all series on a pro rata basis 
excess fee income  finance charge and recovery cash flows above contractual expense payments are first applied to meet spread accounts receivable requirements then returned to us as part of the interest only strip receivable 
we determine upper and lower valuation limits of the retained interests in loans securitized based on historical and forecasted excess spreads 
we then determine the best estimate within the range based on historical trends weighted heavily toward the low end of the range  adjusted  as appropriate  for portfolio forecast information 
the contractual retained interests represent the subordinated securities held by us 
there is no stated interest rate associated with these securities  and these securities are not rated 
they are subordinated to all other securities  except for the interest only strip receivable we own and  accordingly  are repaid last 
their fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks of the underlying assets and the expected timing based on the scheduled maturity date for the underlying securitization 
if these securities are recoverable based on the metris master trust forecasts  cash flows related to the entire subordinated principal balance are used in determining their fair value 
the transferor s interests represent undivided interests in receivables that are not pledged to support a specific security series or class and represent our interest in the excess principal receivables held in the metris master trust 
the fair value is determined in the same manner as the contractual retained interests and is discounted based on twelve months to maturity 
we have subordinated our rights to the excess cash flows on the principal receivables underlying the transferor s interests  thus they are included  instead  in the value of the interest only strip receivable 
spread accounts receivable balances represent cash held by the metris master trust trustee as reserves required by certain series 
these balances earn interest and the fair value is determined in the same manner as the contractual retained interests 
the interest only strip receivable represents the contractual right to receive from the metris master trust interest and other fee revenue  less certain costs  over the estimated life of the underlying debt securities 
the fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks of the underlying assets and the expected timing of the amortization inherent in the retained interests valuation model 
we believe our discount rates are consistent with what our competition would use to determine the fair value of these assets 
the valuation model assumes that we repurchase the outstanding principal receivables at face value according to the clean up call provisions contained in the respective security series legal documents 
we use certain assumptions and estimates in determining the fair values of retained interests in loans securitized 
these assumptions and estimates include estimated principal payments  credit losses  gross yield  interest expense  fees  the timing of cash receipts  and discount rates commensurate with the risks of the underlying assets 
on a quarterly basis  we review and adjust as appropriate the assumptions and estimates used in our model based on a variety of internal and external factors  including national and economic trends and business conditions  current lending policies  procedures and strategies  historical trends and assumptions about future trends  competition  and legal and regulatory requirements 
significant estimates are required in determining these factors and different judgments concerning these factors can result in a material impact on our balance sheet and income statement 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include an adjustment to the fair value of retained interests in loans securitized that might result from the inability to finance future receivables 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted common share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted common share in the increase in net loss of million is primarily due to a million reduction in net interest income and a million reduction in other operating income  offset by a million decrease in provision for loan losses and a million reduction in other operating expense 
included in the results is a million after tax net loss consisting of special items associated with the impacts from the sale of our membership club and warranty business  two credit card loan portfolio sales totaling billion  a workforce reduction  the sale of certificates of deposit by direct merchants bank  and the write down of certain fixed assets and leases 
included in the same period of are million of pre tax special items associated with the write downs of excess property  equipment  and operating leases and a write down of a portfolio of charged off loans purchased in and net interest income net interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our credit card loans  less interest expense on borrowings to fund loans and operations

the decrease in margin is primarily due to a basis point decrease in yield on interest earning assets resulting from a million reduction in average credit card loans and a basis point increase in the costs of funds due to higher interest expense incurred on the term debt instruments outstanding during the respective periods 
as of december   of our average interest earning assets were in credit card loans  compared to as of december  the overall yield decrease is primarily due to the shift in the mix of interest earning assets to lower yielding assets 
net interest income is affected by changes in the average interest rate earned on interest earning assets and the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  in addition to changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the average age of our credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates 
in order to minimize losses  we continue to focus our resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts and on collections efforts 
we also use credit line assignment  customer transaction authorization controls and account management strategies to minimize loan losses 
our internal risk models determine initial credit lines at the time of underwriting 
we manage credit lines on an ongoing basis and adjust them based on customer usage  risk profile  and payment patterns 
we continually monitor customer accounts and initiate appropriate collection activities when an account is delinquent or overlimit 
delinquencies it is our policy to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts  except in limited circumstances  until we charge off the account 
in november  we stopped billing late fees once an account became days contractually delinquent  and in march  we stopped billing overlimit fees once an account became days contractually delinquent 
past due accounts are re aged to current status only after we receive at least three minimum payments or the equivalent cumulative amount 
accounts can only be re aged to current status once every twelve months and two times every five years 
accounts entering long term fixed payment forbearance programs may receive a re age upon entering the debt forbearance program workout re age 
workout re ages can only occur after receipt of at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments  or the equivalent cumulative amount as defined by the debt management program 
in accordance with ffiec guidance  workout re ages can only occur once in five years

these transactions have a direct effect on our delinquency dollars and rates 
excluding the sale of million of cycle plus delinquent receivables in december  the delinquency ratio would have been percent as of december  there was no sale of delinquent receivables during the fourth quarter of the increase in delinquencies as of december  versus december  primarily reflects the overall credit quality of the remaining receivables in the owned portfolio 
net charge offs net charge offs are the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to make minimum payments  bankrupt cardholders and deceased cardholders  less current period recoveries 
net charge offs exclude accrued finance charges and fees  which are charged off against the applicable revenue line item at the time of charge off 
we charge off and take accounts as a loss within i days following formal notification of bankruptcy  ii at the end of the month during which most unsecured accounts become contractually days past due  iii at the end of the month during which unsecured accounts that have entered into a credit counseling or other similar debt forbearance program later become contractually days past due  or iv at the end of the month during which secured accounts become contractually days past due after first reducing the loss by the secured deposit 
beginning in the fourth quarter of we changed our policy for recognizing credit losses on accounts that enter into a settlement payment arrangement 
under the new policy  the portion of the balance that has been forgiven is charged off upon entering into the settlement arrangement with the customer 
the previous policy recognized these losses after the completion of the settlement arrangement 
we charge off accounts that are identified as fraud losses no later than days after discovery 
we enter into agreements with third parties for the sale of a majority of charged off accounts 
we also refer charged off accounts to our recovery unit for coordination of collection efforts to recover the amounts owed 
when appropriate  we place accounts with external collection agencies or attorneys 
charge offs due to bankruptcies were million  representing of total gross charge offs  as of december   and million  representing of total gross charge offs  as of december  table presents our net charge offs for the periods indicated as reported in the consolidated financial statements

these transactions have a direct effect on our charge off dollars and rates as any reduction in the loan s value is reflected as a charge off 
during  we sold two portfolios of delinquent accounts approximating million in receivables  resulting in a million charge off 
during  we sold two portfolios of delinquent accounts approximating million in receivables  resulting in a million charge off 
provision and allowance for loan losses we record provisions for loan losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at a level sufficient to absorb anticipated probable loan losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in order to mitigate credit losses  we have focused our collection efforts to aggressively address any potential delinquency dollar and severity increases 
we also utilize debt forbearance programs and credit counseling services for qualifying cardholders that are experiencing payment difficulties 
these programs include reduced interest rates  reduced or suspended fees  and other incentives to induce the customer to continue making payments 
the amount of customer receivables in debt forbearance programs was million  or of total credit card loans  as of december   compared to million or of total credit card loans  as of december  all delinquent receivables in debt forbearance programs are included in table the provision for loan losses for the year ended december   totaled million compared to a provision of million in the decrease in the provision for loan losses in compared to primarily reflects the decrease in credit card loans during the year  primarily offset by the increased delinquency rate as of december  discussed above 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of credit card loans  as of december   versus million  or of credit card loans  as of december  our roll rate models  including management contingency  indicated our required allowance for loan losses was million as of december   compared to a range of million to million as of december  we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable future losses inherent in the loan portfolio under current conditions 
retained interests in loans securitized our credit card receivables are primarily funded by asset securitizations through the metris master trust 
upon securitization  the company removes the applicable credit card loans from the balance sheet and recognizes the retained interests in loans securitized at their allocated carrying value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

assets may be sold to the metris master trust at the inception of a securitization series 
we also sell receivables to the metris master trust on a daily basis to replenish receivable balances that have decreased due to payments and charge offs 
the difference between the allocated carrying value and the proceeds from the assets sold is recorded as a gain or loss on sale and is included in securitization income 
at the same time  the company recognizes the retained interests in loans securitized 
the retained interests in loans securitized are financial assets measured at fair value consistent with trading securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and include the contractual retained interests  an interest only strip receivable  excess transferor s interests and spread accounts receivable 
the contractual retained interests consist of non interest bearing securities held by the company 
the interest only strip receivable represents the present value of the excess of the estimated future interest and fee collections expected to be generated by the securitized loans over the period the securitized loans are projected to be outstanding above the interest paid on investor certificates  credit losses  contractual servicing fees  and other expenses 
the excess transferor s interests represent principal receivables held in the metris master trust over the contractual retained interests 
spread accounts receivable represents restricted cash reserve accounts held by the metris master trust that can be used to fund payments due to securitization investors and credit enhancers if cash flows are insufficient 
cash held in spread accounts is released to us if certain conditions are met or a securitization series terminates with amounts remaining in the spread accounts 
the fair value of the retained interests in loans securitized is determined through estimated cash flows discounted at rates that reflect the level of subordination  the projected repayment term  and the credit risk of the securitized loans 
the following summarizes our retained interests in loans securitized as of december  and december  table retained interests in loans securitized december  december  in thousands contractual retained interests   excess transferor s interests   interest only strip receivable   spread accounts receivable   retained interests in loans securitized   retained interests in loans securitized increased by million between december  and december   to million 
the increase is primarily due to a million increase in spread accounts receivable partially offset by a million decrease in contractual retained interests 
the contractual retained interests decreased million from december  to december   primarily due to the sale of receivables to a third party in the third and fourth quarters of  and attrition in the securitized loan portfolio 
the decrease in contractual retained interests was partially offset by higher enhancement levels required by recent securitization agreements 
spread accounts receivable increased over december  as all excess spread earned on receivables held in the metris master trust was being restricted from release to the company due to the performance of the receivables 
for more information on restricted cash see the liquidity  funding  and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on pages at least quarterly  the company adjusts the valuation of the retained interests in loans securitized to reflect changes in the amount and expected timing of future cash flows 
the significant factors that affect the timing and amount of cash flows relate to collateral assumptions  which include payment rate  default rate  gross yield and discount rate 
these values can  and will  vary as a result of changes in the amount and timing of the cash flows and the underlying economic assumptions 
the components of retained interests are recorded at their fair value 
see critical accounting estimates on pages for more information on the valuation of the retained interests in loans securitized 
the significant assumptions used for estimating the fair value of the retained interests in loans securitized are as follows at december  monthly payment rate gross yield annual interest expense and servicing fees annual gross principal default rate discount rate contractual retained interests excess transferor s interests interest only strip receivable spread accounts receivable includes expected cash flows from finance charges  late and overlimit fees  debt waiver premiums and bad debt recoveries 
gross yield for purposes of estimating fair value does not include cash flows from interchange income  or cash advance fees 
beginning in  the discount rate on spread account balances have been reduced by interest income expected to be earned 
the decrease in the gross yield assumption reflects lower libor rates and an improvement in credit quality in the metris master trust during  which has resulted in lower yields 
the lower default rate assumption also reflects the improved credit quality in the metris master trust 
in the third quarter of  we repurchased million of randomly selected credit card loans from the metris master trust and subsequently sold the assets to a third party 
the sale was undertaken to generate liquidity needed to fund the sale of the bank s certificates of deposit in order to comply with a request by the occ to eliminate federally insured deposits at direct merchants bank  or the risk thereof to the fdic  by september   and to create additional liquidity in the metris master trust 
in addition  at the direction of our conduit providers to reduce outstanding balances  on november  we repurchased and subsequently sold to a third party an additional million of randomly selected credit card loans from the metris master trust 
the sale was necessary to create additional liquidity  reduce outstanding conduit borrowings  and to lower funding requirements 
the proceeds from both sale transactions were less than the valuation determined under the discounted cash flow methodology we use in establishing the fair value of our retained interests in loans securitized 
these sales were necessary transactions given the company s liquidity position and financing market conditions at that time 
we do not believe the prices in the september and november sales are representative of the overall fair value of our remaining retained interests in loans securitized and  therefore  these two events were factored separately into our retained interests valuations 
at december   the sensitivity of the current fair value of the retained interests in loans securitized to immediate and adverse changes are as follows in millions adverse impact on fair value adverse change adverse change annual discount rate monthly payment rate gross yield annual interest expense and servicing fees annual gross principal default rate as the sensitivity indicates  the fair value of the company s retained interests in loans securitized on its balance sheet  as well as reported earnings  could vary significantly if different assumptions or conditions prevail 
securitization income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following table details securitization income for the years ended december    and respectively

interest only revenue decreased from million in to million in  due to a billion reduction in receivables held in the metris master trust and a basis point decrease in excess spread in the metris master trust 
the million adverse change in the loss gain on replenishment of receivables to the metris master trust from to is primarily due to a reduction in the benefit from receivables purchased from the bank at a million net discount in  as compared to a million net discount in the million improvement in the change in fair market value of retained interests in loans securitized is primarily due to a stabilization of the interest only asset resulting from the flattening of excess spreads in the metris master trust 
the million reduction in fair value in is primarily due to a discount on the increasing spread accounts receivable balance 
other operating income other operating income was million in  a decrease of million or from million in securitization income decreased million during the year as discussed more fully above 
servicing income on securitized sold receivables was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in servicing income was caused by a million reduction in average principal receivables held by the metris master trust during credit card fees  interchange  credit protection and other credit card income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in average credit card loans of million over the twelve month period 
furthering this decline was an amendment to the core transaction documents of the metris master trust agreement  resulting in interchange income earned on receivables held in the metris master trust being recorded as a contribution to the excess spread of the metris master trust as of may during the third quarter of  we sold our membership club and warranty business 
the gain on sale of membership club and warranty business was million 
as a result of the sale  enhancement services revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  included in the gain was the recognition of million of deferred income and the write off of million of deferred costs  included in other assets 
as of december  we had million of deferred income  and million in deferred costs  associated with the sold business  which will expire throughout other operating expense other operating expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from a shrinking of the core business and the sale of our membership club and warranty business 
credit card account and other product solicitation and marketing expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million over is the result of the company s decisions to decrease the size of our managed credit card portfolio through lower account acquisitions and to exit the membership club and warranty business 
employee compensation decreased million for the year ended december  to million primarily as a result of the elimination of  positions during the year and the sale of our membership club and warranty business during the third quarter of data processing services and communications expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the reduction in our managed credit card portfolio 
credit protection claims expense decreased million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in receivable balances covered by our debt waiver products 
occupancy and equipment expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  due to the reduction in facilities as a result of decreased staffing levels 
asset impairments  lease write offs and severance were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we recorded million for workforce reductions  approximately million in write downs of excess property  equipment  and operating leases  a million write off of purchased portfolio premium on credit card loans sold in the third and fourth quarters of  and a million write off of commitment fees related to a backup financing facility entered into in march  with thomas h 
lee equity fund iv  lp comparatively  in  we recorded a write down of million for portfolios of charged off loans purchased in and  a million write down of excess property  equipment  operating leases  and the then pending sale of our arizona facility 
other expense was million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease compared to the prior year was primarily due to a write off of million in marketing and origination costs on our retail note program during  a million reduction from the write off of certain uncollectible receivables during  and an overall shrinking of the core business during derivative activities we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to interest rate risk 
mri enters into interest rate cap transactions related to each asset backed securitization transaction 
mri assigns all of its right  title and interest under the interest rate cap agreements to the trustee of the metris master trust for the benefit of the holders of securities issued by the metris master trust 
the purpose of the interest rate cap is to effectively limit the interest exposure of the metris master trust for each individual series to a maximum amount based on the libor rate 
the interest rate caps do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment 
the change in the fair value of the caps is included in the consolidated income statement under securitization income 
we recognized expense of million and million from the mark to market adjustments on the interest rate caps for the years ended december  and  respectively 
prior to  we entered into interest rate swap transactions through direct merchants bank 
the swaps were used to convert a portion of the fixed rate certificates of deposit issued by the bank cds to variable rate cds  and thus hedge the fair market value of the cds 
the cds exposed us to variability in the fair value in rising or declining interest rate environments 
by converting the fixed payment to a variable payment  the interest rate swaps reduced the variability of the fair market value of the cds 
consistent with sfas no 
 all swaps are designated as fair value hedges 
changes in the value of the swaps are recognized in income  in the period in which the change in value occurred 
in addition  changes in the value of the cds  to the extent they are attributable to the risk being hedged  were simultaneously recognized in income 
any difference between the fair value change in the swaps versus the fair value change in the related hedged cds was considered to be the ineffective portion of the hedge 
the ineffective portion of the swap was recorded as an increase or decrease in income 
during and  all swaps were sold 
at the date of sale  the swap and the related cds were valued  and a gain or loss was recognized on the difference between the change in fair value of the swap and the change in fair value of the cds 
the cumulative amount recorded as an adjustment to the value of the cds was amortized over the life of the cds as an adjustment to interest expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  down from net income of million  or per diluted share in net interest income decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for year ended december  the decrease is due to a decrease in average interest earning assets of million and a basis point reduction in net interest margin 
the decrease in margin is primarily due to a basis point decrease in yield resulting from a million reduction in average credit card loans and a basis point reduction in the prime rate 
additionally  there was a shift in the mix of assets from higher yielding credit card loans to lower yielding investments 
for the year ended december   of our average interest earning assets were in credit card loans  compared to for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was million in compared to million in the decrease relates to the estimated required balance in the allowance for loan losses to cover probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio under applicable conditions 
the size of the credit card loan portfolio  net principal charge offs  recent delinquency and collection trends  and economic conditions were factors considered by management in determining the necessary balance in the allowance for loan losses 
average credit card loans decreased to billion in from billion in the net principal charge off rate was in compared to in the increase in the net principal charge off rate is partially due to the sale of approximately million of delinquent receivables in the sale resulted in a charge off of million 
the weak economic environment and the effects of the company s credit line increase program on the severity of credit losses also adversely affected the net charge off rate 
charge offs due to bankruptcies were million  representing of total gross charge offs as of december  and million  representing of total gross charge offs as of december  other operating income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in securitization income to million in the decrease in securitization income was primarily due to an unfavorable change in the market value adjustment of million and a reduction of million in interest only revenue based on the performance of the underlying assets 
these changes were partially offset by an increase of million in gains on asset replenishment and an million increase in discount accretion income 
servicing income on securitized sold receivables of million increased million over the increase in servicing income was due to the increase in securitized credit card receivables due to the transfer of approximately billion of receivables from direct merchants bank to the metris master trust 
credit card fees  interchange and other credit card income decreased to million in  compared to million in the decrease in credit card fees  interchange and other credit card income is due to the reduction of our owned credit card portfolio 
in addition  we also amended the metris master trust core transaction documents  which resulted in interchange income earned on receivables held by the metris master trust to be recorded as contribution to the excess spread earned  effective may in  million of interchange income was earned by the metris master trust 
enhancement services revenue increased to million due primarily to increased active enrollments in various membership products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in serviceedge r revenue due to the run off of the serviceedge r portfolio and a decrease in purchaseshield r revenue due to decreased enrollments 
total other operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million over credit card account and other product solicitation and marketing expenses decreased million over credit protection claims expense increased million  reflecting higher claims paid on debt waiver death benefits and interest forgiven  as well as an increase in our estimate of unreported claims as of the balance sheet date 
as of december   we had a debt waiver total covered balance of billion  compared to billion as of december  employee compensation decreased million for the year ended december   due to decreased staffing needs and fringe benefits 
other expenses increased million 
during  we recorded approximately million of write downs of excess property  equipment  operating leases  and the pending sale of our arizona building 
in addition  we recorded a million write down on portfolios of charged off loans purchased in and the book value of these portfolios was million as of december   compared to million as of december  balance sheet analysis cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease was primarily due to the million of cash used to fund the sale of cds during the third quarter of  offset by sales of receivables from direct merchants bank to the metris master trust and other third parties 
liquidity reserve deposit during  in compliance with our operating agreement with the occ  direct merchants bank established restricted deposits with a third party depository bank for the purpose of supporting direct merchant bank s funding needs 
these deposits are invested in short term liquid investments 
as of december   the balance of these deposits was million 
credit card loans credit card loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december  the million decrease is primarily a result of the sale of million in credit card loans from direct merchants bank to the metris master trust 
in addition  million in credit card loans were sold to third parties in september property and equipment property and equipment  net decreased to million at december   primarily due to the sale of our arizona facility in the second quarter of and the third quarter sale of other assets 
additional decreases occurred from the write down of excess leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures 
purchased portfolio premium purchased portfolio premium decreased to million at december   from million at december  the million decrease was due to the write down of purchased portfolio premium associated with the sales of credit card loans to third parties during the second half of  and the million amortization expense recorded in other assets other assets decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was due to the million reduction in deferred marketing costs from the membership club and warranty business that was sold in july  and a decrease of million in deferred tax assets at december  deposits deposits decreased million to million as of december   from million as of december  in july  the occ requested and direct merchants bank agreed to eliminate federally insured deposits at the bank  or the risk thereof to the fdic 
the bank sold million of insured cds on september   utilizing a combination of cash on hand  cash generated through the sale of credit card receivables to a third party  and sales of credit card receivables to mci  in order to fully comply with the occ s request 
the sale of the cds resulted in a loss of approximately million 
we do not anticipate issuing cds in the foreseeable future 
deferred income deferred income decreased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease primarily relates to the sale of our membership club and warranty business in july stockholders equity stockholders equity was million as of december   a decrease of million from  million as of december  the decrease primarily results from a net loss of million partially offset by million of stock issuances under employee benefit plans 
off balance sheet arrangements our operations are funded primarily through asset securitizations of our credit card receivable principal balances 
we rely heavily on this method of funding and any negative effect on our ability to securitize assets would have a material impact on our business 
we securitize consumer loans in order to manage our total cost of funds 
our securitizations involve packaging and selling pools of both current and future principal receivable balances on credit card accounts  in which we retain the servicing of such receivables 
our securitizations are treated as sales under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and are removed from our balance sheet 
we primarily securitize receivables by selling the receivables to the metris master trust  a proprietary  non consolidated trust  which issues securities through public and private asset backed securitizations or to multi seller commercial paper conduits 
the metris master trust was formed in may pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement  as amended 
metris receivables  inc mri  one of our special purpose entity subsidiaries  transfers receivables in designated accounts to the metris master trust 
the metris master trust may  and does from time to time  issue securities that represent undivided interests in the receivables in the metris master trust 
these securities are issued by series and each series typically has multiple classes of securities 
each series or class within a series may have different terms 
the different classes of an individual series are structured to obtain specific debt ratings 
as of december   series of publicly issued securities were outstanding 
mri currently retains the most subordinated class of securities in each series and all other classes are issued to nonaffiliated third parties 
these securities are interests in the metris master trust only and are not obligations of mri  mci  direct merchants bank  or any other subsidiary of the company 
the interest in the metris master trust not represented by any series of securities issued by the metris master trust also belongs to mri and is known as the transferor s interest 
generally  each series involves an initial reinvestment period  referred to as the revolving period  in which principal payments on receivables allocated to such series are returned to mri and reinvested in new principal receivables arising in the accounts 
after the revolving period ends  principal payments allocated to the series are then accumulated and used to repay the investors 
this period is referred to as the accumulation period  and is followed by a controlled amortization period wherein investors are repaid their invested amount 
currently  the metris master trust does not have any series in an accumulation period or controlled amortization period 
the scheduled accumulation and amortization periods are set forth in the agreements governing each series 
however  all series set forth certain events by which amortization can be accelerated  referred to as early amortization 
reasons an early amortization could occur include i one or three month average of portfolio collections  less principal and finance charge charge offs  financing costs and servicing costs  would drop below certain levels  ii negative transferor s interest within the metris master trust  or iii failure to obtain funding during an accumulation period for a maturing term asset backed securitization 
new receivables in designated accounts cannot be funded from a series that is in early amortization 
we currently do not have any series that are in early amortization 
in addition  there are various triggers within our securitization agreements that  if broken  would restrict the release of cash to us from the metris master trust 
this restricted cash provides additional security to the investors in the metris master trust 
we reflect cash restricted from release in the metris master trust at its fair value as retained interests in loans securitized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the triggers are usually related to the performance of the metris master trust  specifically the average of net excess spread over a one to three month period 
on a monthly basis  each series is allocated its share of finance charge and fee collections which are used to pay investors interest on their securities  pay their share of servicing fees  and reimburse investors for their share of losses due to charge offs 
amounts remaining may be deposited in cash accounts of the metris master trust as additional protection for future losses 
once each of these obligations is fully met  remaining finance charge collections  if any  are returned to us 
principal receivables held by the metris master trust were billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
revenues and expenses generated from the metris master trust are found in the securitization income and servicing income on securitized sold receivables lines in the consolidated statements of income 
our interests retained in credit card receivables sold to the metris master trust are recorded at fair value in retained interests in loans securitized on the consolidated balance sheets 
the cash flows generated from the metris master trust are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements on page of this report 
maintaining adequate liquidity in the metris master trust is  and will continue to be  at the forefront of our business objectives 
additional information regarding asset securitization is set forth under liquidity  funding  and capital resources below 
additional information regarding the accounting for our retained interests in loans securitized can be found in note significant accounting policies on pages of this report 
liquidity  funding  and capital resources one of our primary financial goals is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity through active management of assets and liabilities 
liquidity management is a dynamic process  affected by changes in the characteristics of our assets and liabilities and short and long term interest rates  and by the capital markets 
we use a variety of financing sources to manage liquidity  funding  and interest rate risks

we used cash generated from these transactions to reduce borrowings and to fund the credit card loan portfolio 
our contractual cash obligations as of december  were as follows less than one to four to over five in thousands one year three years five years years total long term debt    operating leases      contractual purchase obligations     deposits   total      includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by noncancellable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees 
in addition to contractual cash obligations  open to buy on credit card accounts as of december  was billion 
while this amount represents the total lines of credit available to our customers  we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will exercise their entire available line at any given point in time 
we also have the right to increase  reduce  cancel  alter or amend the terms for these available lines of credit at any time 
see the tables on pages of this report for further information 
as of december   we had twelve month contractual cash obligations of million and off balance sheet funding scheduled to amortize of billion 
we base the amortization amounts on estimated amortization periods  which are subject to change based on the metris master trust performance 
we have historically utilized a variety of funding vehicles  as well as ongoing cash generated from operations  to finance credit card loans  maturing debt obligations and general operating needs 
during the next twelve months we intend to reduce outstanding receivables in the metris master trust through lower credit card account acquisitions  attrition in the portfolio and third party sales as necessary 
this reduction in the size of the portfolio will significantly reduce our need for additional financing facilities or the issuance of new asset backed securities 
the company will need to obtain conduit warehouse funding arrangements to meet other maturing obligations in the metris master trust and is currently reviewing its alternatives in the conduit market 
we believe that we will be able to obtain the requisite funding that will provide us with adequate liquidity to meet anticipated cash needs through a variety of funding options 
as an example  on march   the company secured an amortizing term series financing of million maturing may   and defeased a million term asset backed securitization series that began an accumulation period on march  at this time  the conduit financing proposals received to date may require us to refinance existing corporate debt that matures in the metris master trust has three surety wrapped asset backed term securitization series that mature over the next two years totaling billion with maturity dates of june  may  and november  respectively 
on march   mri received a billion  two year commitment from mbia insurance corporation mbia to provide financial guaranty insurance policies to refinance these maturing mbia guaranteed series from the metris master trust 
this commitment from mbia will provide financial guaranty insurance capacity to wrap newly issued series from the metris master trust 
we are currently reviewing alternatives to refinance the million outstanding as of march  of the million term loan due june  and the million of senior notes due in november subject to the condition to refinance existing corporate debt discussed above  we believe we will have sufficient cash on hand to allow us to retire both of these loans in without incurring any additional corporate debt  if necessary 
we are also reviewing alternatives to refinance the current outstanding amount of million from the million amortizing metris master trust series due on may  if we are unable to obtain funding from a third party  we would be able to fund the accumulation account for a maturing asset backed term securitization with operating cash for a period of approximately two weeks 
no assurance can be given either that we will be able to obtain all future funding requirements or as to the terms and costs of any funding obtained 
recent downgrades in our credit ratings and the deterioration in our asset quality have reduced our access to funding and have resulted in higher funding costs and less favorable terms than previously were available to us 
future downgrades in our debt ratings or those of direct merchants bank  as well as further deterioration in our asset quality  could continue to negatively impact our funding capabilities 
the metris master trust and the associated off balance sheet debt provide for early amortization if certain events occur 
these events are described in the core transaction documents or individual series documents of each securitization transaction 
significant events may include i three month average excess spreads below levels between and  ii negative excess transferor s interest within the metris master trust  or iii failure to fund during an accumulation period for a maturing term asset backed securitization 
in addition  there are various provisions triggers within our series supplements that  when triggered  restrict the release of cash to us 
the metris master trust trustee holds the cash in spread accounts 
this restricted cash provides additional security to the investors in the metris master trust 
we reflect cash restricted from release by the metris master trust in retained interests in loans securitized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the triggers are primarily related to the performance of the metris master trust  in particular the average of net excess spread over a one to three month period 
the following table shows the annualized yields  defaults  costs and excess spreads for the metris master trust on a cash basis 
year ended december  dollars in thousands gross yield    annual principal defaults    net portfolio yield    annual interest expense and servicing fees    net excess spread    includes cash flows from finance charges  late  overlimit and cash advance fees  bad debt recoveries  interchange income effective may  and debt waiver fees  less finance charge and fee charge offs 
the following table illustrates the maximum amount of cash as a percentage of outstanding securitized principal receivables that could be held by the metris master trust trustee as additional collateral if the one month and three month average excess spread of the metris master trust was within various ranges 
cash basis net maximum excess spread restricted greater than less than the cash restricted from release is limited to the amount of excess spread generated in the metris master trust on a cash basis 
during periods of lower excess spreads  the required amount of cash to be restricted in the metris master trust may not be achieved 
during those periods  all excess cash normally released to mri will be restricted from release 
once the maximum amount of cash required to be restricted is restricted from release or excess spreads improve  cash again can be released to us 
based on the performance of the metris master trust  the amount of cash required to be restricted was million at december   and million at december  as of december   million has been restricted from release due to performance  million has been restricted from release due to corporate debt ratings at the inception of the securitization transactions  and million has been restricted from release for maturity reserves 
in addition  million has been restricted from release for defeasance of the series as of december   million had been restricted from release in the metris master trust due to performance and million had been restricted from release due to corporate debt ratings at the inception of the securitization transactions 
the million increase in cash restricted due to performance for the period ended december  consisted of approximately million of net excess cash generated by the metris master trust that was restricted from release  and approximately million that was funded by us as additional enhancement on new transactions 
we expect continued restrictions on the release of a significant portion of our cash basis excess spread throughout on march   we obtained a million extension through march of an million conduit financing which was scheduled to mature in june we also secured a million conduit financing through march  which replaced bank conduit financing and warehouse facilities that matured during march through may finally  we obtained an amortizing term series financing of million maturing march to replace a million term asset backed securitization that began an accumulation period on november  on march   thomas h 
lee equity fund iv  lp thl fund iv committed to provide a term loan to the company in an aggregate amount of million as a backup financing facility  secured by assets of the company 
on june   the term loan commitment was terminated and replaced with a million senior secured loan funded by a consortium of lenders 
with the termination of the thl fund iv commitment  we wrote off million of capitalized commitment fees 
the million senior secured loan was issued pursuant to an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement dated june   and effective as of june   as amended credit agreement 
the loan matures june   and carries a fixed interest rate of plus a monthly performance payment  which is indexed to the monthly excess spread in the metris master trust 
the funds were primarily used to pay off a million term loan that matured in june the terms of the credit agreement under which the loan was issued require mandatory prepayment of a portion of the principal if the company receives funds due to the sale of certain company assets 
during the third quarter of  we were required to make a million principal repayment from the proceeds of the sale of our membership club and warranty business 
since year end  we have made additional principal payments of approximately million 
we are bound by certain covenants under the credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
in addition  under that agreement  dividends declared and paid by direct merchants bank indirectly to mci are limited to the bank s earnings not to exceed million per calendar quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  the internal revenue service irs examination team submitted a request for a technical advice memorandum tam to its washington  dc national office regarding our treatment of certain credit card fees as original issue discount oid 
the request for a tam covers tax returns filed for the years ended december  through december  although these fees are primarily reported as income when billed for financial reporting purposes  we believe the fees constitute oid and must be deferred and amortized over the life of the underlying credit card loans for tax purposes 
cumulatively through december   the company had deferred approximately million in federal income tax under the oid rules 
an assessment ultimately could require the company to pay up to that amount of federal tax plus state taxes and related interest 
the company believes its treatment of these fees is appropriate and continues to work with the irs to resolve this matter 
the company s position is consistent with that of numerous other us credit card issuers 
while both the timing and amount of the final resolution are uncertain  we do not expect any additional tax to be paid over the next twelve months 
the company has million of series c perpetual convertible preferred stock outstanding  which is held by affiliates of thomas h 
lee partners  lp formerly  thomas h 
lee company thl partners  a private equity firm  and is convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per common share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the series c preferred stock has a dividend payable in additional shares of series c preferred stock and will also receive any cash dividends paid on the company s common stock on a converted basis 
one share of series c preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock  plus a premium amount designed to guarantee a portion of seven years worth of dividends at a annual rate 
for conversions in  the premium amount would be equal to approximately of those future dividends 
assuming conversion of the series c preferred stock into common stock  thl partners would own approximately of the company on a diluted basis at december  so long as affiliates of thl partners own at least of the originally issued series c preferred stock or any shares of common stock issued upon conversion thereof  the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of the series c preferred stock are entitled to elect four members to mci s board of directors 
the series c preferred stock may be redeemed by us in certain circumstances by paying of the redemption price of and all accrued dividends at the time of redemption 
we also have the option to redeem the series c preferred stock after december   without restriction by paying the redemption price of and all accrued dividends at the time of redemption 
the federal reserve act imposes various legal limitations on the extent to which banks that are members of the federal reserve system can finance or otherwise supply funds to certain of their affiliates 
in particular  direct merchants bank is subject to certain restrictions on any extensions of credit to mci or its subsidiaries 
additionally  direct merchants bank is limited in its ability to declare dividends to mci or its subsidiaries 
therefore  direct merchants bank s investments in federal funds sold are generally not available for the general liquidity needs of the company or its subsidiaries 
our secured unsecured debt is rated by moody s investor services moody s  standard poor s rating services s p and fitch  inc fitch 
factors affecting the various ratings include the overall health of the global national economy  specific economic conditions impacting the subprime consumer finance industry  and the overall financial performance of the company  including earnings  credit losses  delinquencies  excess spreads in the metris master trust and our overall liquidity 
furthermore  certain of our term asset backed securitizations require the restriction of cash if our corporate debt ratings go below certain levels

moody s s p fitch metris companies inc 
senior unsecured debt caa ccc ccc moody s  s p and fitch have a negative outlook for our debt ratings and the company 
the rating agencies cited concerns about our funding and liquidity challenges  earnings and asset quality 
since the later part of  our corporate debt ratings  the metris master trust ratings and the ratings of direct merchants bank have been downgraded 
these downgrades reflect the continuing losses we have experienced in  as well as deteriorating performance in the metris master trust 
these downgrades and any future downgrades will have a negative effect on our ability to obtain funding 
in addition  access to funding may be at a higher cost and on terms less favorable to us than those previously available as a result of the deterioration in our financial performance and asset quality

furthermore  the company has pledged certain assets as collateral on the credit agreement 
capital adequacy in the normal course of business  direct merchants bank enters into agreements  or is subject to regulatory requirements  that result in cash  debt  dividend or other capital restrictions 
the federal reserve act imposes various legal limitations on the extent to which banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to their affiliates 
in particular  direct merchants bank is subject to certain restrictions on any extensions of credit to  or other covered transactions such as certain purchases of assets with  mci and its affiliates 
bank regulatory laws limit or prohibit direct merchants bank s ability to lend to mci and its affiliates 
additionally  direct merchants bank is limited in its ability to declare dividends indirectly to mci in accordance with the national bank act dividend provisions 
we have approximately million of equity and million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at direct merchants bank as of december  a portion of this cash is available  upon approval of regulatory authorities  to assist in the company s financing needs 
direct merchants bank is subject to certain capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the occ

nothing in the modified operating agreement shall prevent the bank from reducing its capital should circumstances permit so long as the bank first requests and obtains the occ s supervisory non objection to such reduction 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  direct merchants bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors

charge offs due to bankruptcies were million  representing of total managed gross charge offs as of december  and million  representing of total managed gross charge offs as of december  in addition to those bankrupt accounts that were charged off  we received formal notification of million and million of managed bankrupt accounts as of december  and  respectively 
total managed loans decreased billion to billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   and billion at december  this was primarily due to a reduction in credit lines and tighter underwriting standards implemented in  fewer new accounts  increased charged off receivables  and the sale of credit card loans to third parties 
the amount of credit card loans in debt forbearance programs was million  or of total managed loans  as of december   compared with million  or of managed loans  as of december  all delinquent receivables in debt forbearance programs are included in table forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our principal market risk is due to changes in interest rates 
this affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities  as well as indirectly  as interest rates may impact the payment performance of our cardholders 
to manage our direct risk to market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest rates and the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
we seek to minimize that impact primarily by matching asset and liability re pricings 
our primary assets are credit card loans  and retained interests in loans securitized 
our receivables and receivables held by the metris master trust are virtually all priced at rates indexed to the variable prime rate 
we fund credit card loans through a combination of cash flows from operations  bank loans  long term debt and equity issuances 
our securitized loans are held by the metris master trust and bank sponsored multi seller receivables conduits and investors in term series securities within the metris master trust  which have committed funding primarily indexed to variable commercial paper rates and libor 
the long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
at december  and  none of the securities issued out of the metris master trust and conduit funding of securitized receivables was funded with fixed rate securities 
in an interest rate environment with rates significantly above current rates  the potential negative impact on earnings of higher interest expense is partially mitigated by fixed rate funding and interest rate cap contracts 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis  which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on net income from an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates of basis points 
in this analysis  interest rates on floating rate debt are not allowed to decrease below zero percent 
assuming that we take no counteractive measures  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates affecting our floating rate financial instruments  including both debt obligations and receivables  would result in a decrease in net income of approximately million relative to a base case over the next months  compared to an approximate million increase as of december  relative to a base case over the next months 
a decrease of basis points would result in an increase in net income of approximately million as of december   and an increase of approximately million as of december  the change in sensitivity for the basis point decrease is primarily due to the decreased impact on interest expense as interest expense cannot fall below zero 
the change in sensitivity for the basis point increase is primarily due to a lower percentage of receivables that will be impacted by a rate increase
