item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we operate in four reportable segments hotels and restaurants  franchise  central services and development  entertainment  and real estate 
the hotels and restaurants segment derives revenue primarily from room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels and from management fees charged to the owners of our managed hotels 
management fees are typically based on a percentage of the hotel s gross revenues plus an incentive fee based on operating performance 
the franchise  central services and development segment is engaged primarily in licensing our brands to franchisees 
this segment generates revenue from royalty fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brands and access to our central services programs reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  quality inspections  advertising and brand standards 
the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from ticketing services and promotion of entertainment productions 
the real estate segment generates revenue from owning  managing  leasing and developing commercial and multi unit residential properties 

table of contents a summary of our consolidated results  balance sheet data and hotel statistics for the years ended december   and is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  consolidated statement of operations data hotels and restaurants franchise  central services and development entertainment real estate corporate services total revenues direct expenses undistributed corporate expenses operating income interest expense income tax expense benefit net income income loss applicable to common shareholders earnings per common share basic diluted consolidated balance sheet data end of period working capital property and equipment  net total assets notes payable to bank total long term debt and capital lease obligation total liabilities preferred stock and related additional paid in capital total stockholders equity year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues hotel and restaurant revenues for the year ended december  declined by million  or  to million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to reductions of about million in room revenue and million in food and beverage revenue 
at our owned and leased hotels  adr was in compared to in average occupancy in for owned and leased hotels was versus in the resulting revpar of was lower than although demand suffered significantly in the first and second quarters of due  in our opinion  to declining business and excursion travel resulting from national economic challenges  personal spending cutbacks and certain national security threats  we believe these results reflect that our hotel and restaurants segment began to stabilize during the third quarter 
these results are indicative of the overall national trends 
we expected to experience normal seasonal declines in revenue during the fourth quarter and were able to reduce the impact of these declines through effective expense management 
also  much of the decline between the fourth quarter of and was due to an anticipated drop in group business due to the fact 
table of contents that a government agency  which had conducted significant training in  did not contribute to group business in we also believe the rebranding of hotels from westcoast to red lion hotels  which was completed in the first quarter of  is already having a positive effect 
additionally  in the first quarter of  our hotel in salt lake city was positively impacted by the winter olympics 
the lack of similar activity during the first quarter of resulted in a million decrease in comparative revenues 
management fee revenue for the year ended december  declined thousand from this drop was the result of both a decline in the number of hotels managed during the comparable periods  from eleven down to six  and a general decline in the room revenues for the managed properties  on which our management fees are primarily based 
however  these decreases were partially offset by a thousand management agreement termination fee realized during the fourth quarter of we continue to receive a progressively higher percentage of our reservations through third party internet channels  on which we generally realize lower room rates 
decreases in adr slowed during the third and fourth quarters of  partly reflective of our efforts to control these alternate distribution systems  or ads 
we launched a new pilot ads channel management program in select hotels on august  and have realized positive revenue trends in those properties during the trial period 
we have signed fixed charge markup agreements with nine ads providers  which typically entitle the provider to keep a fixed percentage of the price paid by the customer for each room booked 
the central reservations and distribution management technology placed in service during the first and second quarters of allows us to manage the yield on ads channels on a real time  hotel by hotel basis 
franchise  central services and development revenue for the year ended december  decreased by thousand  or  to million compared to million in net changes in franchise fee income accounted for about thousand of this change 
the variance was caused by a departure of franchises that left our hotel system in early  offset by the addition of three franchises to our system during the year 
however  the decreases in fees during were offset by the recording of termination fees totaling thousand 
we do not believe any of these changes in our system represent a material trend in our business 
entertainment segment revenue increased thousand for the year ended december  to million from million in this increase was due primarily to increased ticket demand for tickets for broadway productions and for tickets in eastern washington and colorado  especially during the winter ski season in january  february and december of real estate revenue for the year ended december  decreased by thousand  or  to million from million in the decrease was due primarily to reduced rental revenue in connection with the sale of an office building that closed in march  offset by rental income from new tenants at owned real estate properties and by commissions received on the sales and leasing of certain real estate space on behalf of third parties 
direct expenses in total  direct expenses for the year ended december  increased thousand or  to million in from million in direct hotels and restaurants segment expenses decreased from million in to million in the improvement was principally due to savings on labor resulting from adjustments of our workforce 
these savings were partially offset by increases in the costs of our self funded employee medical coverage 
we also saw the realization from cost cutting measures early in the year 
in the other operating segments  direct costs increased in aggregate thousand  from million in to million in direct costs for franchise  central services and development were down thousand due to labor savings and cost containment 
entertainment segment direct costs were up 
table of contents thousand in connection with increases in sales activity requiring more labor at events 
real estate segment and corporate services direct expenses have remained consistent between periods 
depreciation and amortization were up due to the million recapture of depreciation on assets held for sale described below  additional depreciation on property and equipment additions during the year and additional amortization associated with deferred finance fees associated with the refinance during for the net loss on asset disposals was thousand 
the amount is comprised of a thousand loss on the disposition of our interest in a hotel and the disposition of signage related to the rebranding of of our hotels  offset by the recognition of deferred gains related to an office building and a hotel property 
the large gain in is related to the original sale of the same office building 
conversion costs represent the expense incurred unrelated to property and equipment to re brand the hotels to the red lion name 
undistributed corporate expenses undistributed corporate expenses for the year ended december  increased thousand to million from million for this change was due primarily to higher employee benefit costs and increases in the expenses relative to both insurance and professional services in  offset by our cost containment efforts 
undistributed corporate expense includes general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  legal expense  contributions  directors and officers insurance  bank service charges  outside accountants and consultants expense  and investor relations charges 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not distributed to those segments 
in contrast  costs more directly related to our business segments such as accounting  human resources and information technology expenses are distributed out and included in direct expenses 
operating income operating income for year ended december  decreased million or from million in to million in we believe the decline in operating income was primarily due to a continued soft market and weak us economy  which continue to result in reduced room rates and occupancy at our hotels 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  up thousand over or 
the increase was due to a greater average amount of outstanding interest bearing debt in versus while the average interest rate on debt stayed consistent  in versus in a substantial portion of our borrowings carry an interest rate of for ten years  which management believes is a favorable long term rate 
income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december  decreased by million to a benefit of thousand compared to million of expense in primarily due to lower pre tax income and the benefit realized from certain tax credits utilized in other income expense other income expense for the year ended december  was a net expense of thousand  comprised of thousand in deferred loan fee write offs related to the refinance of debt during the second and fourth quarters of  partially offset by a contract termination fee of thousand and other miscellaneous net gains of thousand 
the other income expense net balance for the comparable period of was consistent with our historical results 

table of contents net income net income for the year ended december  decreased million compared to  due primarily to a million decline between periods in operating income for hotels and restaurants 
a number of repositioning initiatives impacted year on year financial comparisons  including the following results from the first quarter of included a million pre tax gain on the sale of an office building  results included more than thousand of conversion expenses including a non cash write down of signage related to the re branding of hotels to the red lion name  we completed the refinance and replacement of our revolving credit facility in the second and third quarter of  resulting in a non cash write off of thousand in loan fees  in the second quarter of we realized a loss on disposition of a partnership interest of thousand  and  during we recaptured approximately million of non cash depreciation expense associated with assets that were reclassified in as no longer held for sale 
the above items accounted for a decline in income before taxes of million of the total decline in net income in compared to earnings loss per share earnings per share for year ended december  decreased by to a loss per share of compared to earnings per share for the weighted average number of shares outstanding did not change substantively during  however  income loss applicable to common shareholders decreased million 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  an increase of million or from we attribute the overall increase in revenues from to to the following hotel and restaurant revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in hotel and restaurant revenues resulted primarily from the acquisition on december  of red lion hotels  inc  whose hotels contributed million to the revenues in this revenue increase in was partially offset by a continued soft us economy  resulting in a decrease in demand 
sluggish demand in resulted in lower room and occupancy rates which contributed to decreases in revpar  adr and average occupancy from their levels in franchise  central services and development revenues increased thousand  or  from million in to million in of the revenues   or million  were attributable to franchise and management contracts acquired through the purchase of red lion hotels  inc at the end of this increase was partially offset by reduced franchise application fees and system wide revpar declines in compared to  which we believe resulted from the continued softness of the us economy 
entertainment division revenues decreased thousand  or  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to the removal of call center service revenues and related expenses from the entertainment division to a central program fund which we began to administer effective january and in which we and our franchisees participate 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating revenue as a result of an increase in venues and a favorable event mix in compared to real estate division revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in primarily due to reduced lease revenue that resulted from the sale of our majority interest in an office building in march direct expenses direct expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in virtually all of this increase was due to the addition of hotels to our system as a result of the acquisition of red lion hotels  inc at the end of in addition  net gain on asset dispositions and insurance settlements 
table of contents was million less in than in  partly due to an insurance settlement for assets destroyed in a fire at one of our office buildings in the overall increase was offset by a reduction of thousand in amortization expense related to brand names and goodwill by reduced expense resulting from the removal of call center service revenues and related expenses from the entertainment division to a central program fund that we began to administer in january undistributed corporate expenses undistributed corporate expenses increased thousand  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to a one time executive severance payment related to the acquisition of red lion hotels  inc operating income operating income decreased million  or  from million in to million in we believe the decline in operating income following the acquisition of red lion hotels  inc at the end of was primarily due to a continued soft market and weak us economy  which resulted in decreases in rates and occupancy in compared to their levels in in addition  net gain on asset dispositions was million less in than in interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was attributable to a reduction in outstanding borrowings and a decrease in interest rates charged on our variable rate debt 
income taxes income tax expense decreased thousand from million in to million in the effective income tax rate for decreased to from in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the utilization of certain income tax credits in that exceeded by thousand income tax credits utilized in net income net income increased thousand  or  from million in to million in income applicable to common shareholders decreased million  or  from million in to million in due to a million of dividends paid in on preferred stock issued at the end of in connection with the acquisition of red lion hotels  inc earnings per share basic earnings per share decreased from in to in diluted earnings per share decreased from in to in liquidity and capital resources overview we believe that the consummation of the million offering of trust preferred securities in the first quarter of and the million debt refinance in june  described below in financing  and the elimination of our preferred stock and its associated dividend requirements will strengthen our financial condition  particularly in the long term 
in addition  the credit agreement we entered into in october  also described in financing below  provides revolving credit of up to million and a term loan of up to million 
we currently intend to use this new credit facility for our short term working capital needs and to  among other things  finance capital expenditures and potential acquisitions of hotels 
in january we closed on the purchase of the red lion hotel yakima gateway property under an option exercised in 
table of contents we also held an option to purchase the red lion bellevue inn  which we exercised in january we have not identified any other acquisitions that are probable 
our short term liquidity needs include funds for interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and on the debentures  funds for capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and reserves established from existing cash  the proceeds of the trust preferred offering and  if necessary  by drawing upon our credit facility 
a majority of our leased and owned hotels are subject to leases and debt agreements that require us to spend to of room revenues from these hotels on replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment at  or payment of insurance premiums or real and personal property taxes with respect to  these hotels 
this is consistent with what we would spend on furniture  fixtures and equipment under normal circumstances to maintain the competitive appearance of our owned and leased hotels 
in general  we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property development  property acquisitions  renovations and other non recurring capital improvements through net cash from operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  including our credit facility  through the issuance of debt or equity securities and through joint ventures 
historically  our cash and capital requirements have been satisfied through cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities  and the issuance of equity securities 
we believe cash flow from operations  available borrowings under our new credit facility and cash on hand will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service and other obligations through our ability to fund operations  make planned capital expenditures  make required payments on any securities we may issue in the future and remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will be dependent on our future operating performance 
our future operating performance is dependent on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including occupancy and the room rates we can charge 
these factors include prevailing economic conditions and financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors affecting our business and operations  and may be dependent on the availability of borrowings under our credit facility or other borrowings or securities offerings 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  net income  after reconciling adjustments to net cash provided by operations such as non cash income statement impacts like depreciation  loan fee write offs  the deferred tax provision  gains and losses on assets  and the provision for doubtful accounts totaled million in for net income adjusted for those same items totaled million 
the difference was predominantly due to lower operating performance  specifically in the hotels and restaurants segment 
working capital changes  including restricted cash  receivables  accruals  payables  and inventories  used an additional million in cash during this was predominantly due to the additions to restricted cash and the timing of payroll liabilities 
in  working capital changes accounted for in the change in cash  mostly related to receivables  prepaid expenses  and restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additions to property and equipment totaled million in compared to million in capital additions included an investment in signage related to the red lion rebranding initiative and various other projects in the operating divisions 
it also included additions to certain software and equipment which was sold and then leased back as described in financing below 
the other major variances between the two periods were million of proceeds from asset dispositions received in compared to million of proceeds from asset dispositions received in the comparable period  including thousand received in connection with the disposition of our ownership interest in a hotel property in the second quarter of and million related to the sales operating leaseback of another property during the fourth quarter of also described below in financing 
net financing activities used million during  including scheduled term debt and capital lease payments of million  preferred stock dividends of million  and loan fees paid of million 
the uses 
table of contents of cash were offset by the net activity related to refinancing our debt structure of million and proceeds from short term borrowings of million related to a sales operating lease back transaction described below in financing 
through december  we also incurred approximately thousand in costs associated with the offering of trust preferred securities completed in the first quarter of at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents including million of cash restricted under securitized borrowing arrangements for future payment of furniture  fixtures and equipment  repairs  insurance premiums and real and personal property taxes 
approximately million of the cash balance was held by an intermediary related to the sale of the red lion river inn  without restriction as to use  to facilitate a tax deferred exchange transaction completed in january at december  we had million in cash on hand included restricted cash of million 
financing on june   we obtained term debt of million from column financial  inc  a credit suisse first boston subsidiary 
the debt is secured by ten of our owned hotels  requires monthly payments based on a fixed interest rate of per annum and a year principal amortization schedule  and matures in full on july  in connection with securing this term debt  we incurred loan fees and other costs totaling million which have been capitalized and will be amortized using the effective interest method over the ten year period of the underlying promissory notes 
we then used a majority of these proceeds to pay off the million outstanding balance on our then existing revolving credit facility with us bank  national association 
this facility was terminated in october and all collateral securing the facility was released 
in june  we completed the sale to general electric capital corporation of software and equipment primarily related to our new central reservation system previously included in construction in process 
the proceeds of million were used to repay the outstanding balance on an interim note payable to general electric capital corporation in the same amount 
certain other costs directly related to the software and equipment were paid for directly by general electric capital corporation  totaling thousand 
we then entered into an operating lease agreement with general electric capital corporation which expires in june requiring monthly payments of thousand 
at our option  the lease term is renewable for three one year terms 
in october  we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association 
the credit agreement provides us a revolving credit facility with a total of million in borrowing capacity 
this includes two revolving lines of credit line a allows for maximum borrowings of million and is collateralized by our personal property and five of our owned hotels 
line b allows for maximum borrowings of million and is collateralized by our personal property 
we are required to exhaust our borrowing capacity under line a before we may borrow under line b 
interest under each line is computed based  at our option  upon either the bank s prime rate or certain libor rates 
the agreement contains certain restrictions and covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million and a maximum funded debt to ebitda as defined by the bank ratio of which will decrease to for the fiscal quarter ending december  and remain at that ratio for the remainder of the facility s term 
line a does not require any principal payments until its maturity date of october as a result  any future borrowings under this line in or would be reflected as a long term liability 
line b has a maturity date of october there were no outstanding line of credit borrowings at december  the bank credit facility also allows for a million term facility that is available to refinance  and would be collateralized by  the red lion hotel yakima gateway 
we expect that the term of the loan would be seven years 
in november  we sold the red lion river inn to an unrelated third party for million 
we then leased the property from the new owner 
the lease has a year term and we have the option to extend the term for up to three additional five year periods 
as of december  we had debt obligations of million  of which  or million  were fixed rate debt securities secured by individual properties 
there were no borrowings under the any lines of credit during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents in the first quarter of we completed a public offering of million of trust preferred securities through westcoast hospitality capital trust  a delaware statutory trust sponsored by westcoast 
the securities  which have been listed on the new york stock exchange  are entitled to cumulative cash distributions at a annual rate and will mature on february  the trust used the proceeds of the offering to purchase from us million of our junior subordinated debentures with payment terms that mirror the distribution terms of the trust preferred securities 
after payment of underwriting commissions and expenses of the trust preferred offering and before costs incurred directly by us  we realized net proceeds from the offering of approximately million from the debenture sale 
as discussed below  we applied approximately million of these proceeds to redeem in full all outstanding shares of our series a and series b preferred stock 
we will use the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
other matters assets held for sale at december   our assets held for sale consisted of two office buildings in spokane  washington and the westcoast kalispell center hotel and mall with an aggregate net carrying value of million 
in june  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a potential buyer for the westcoast kalispell center hotel and mall 
subsequently  in july  our company and the buyer mutually terminated this agreement  at which time we determined that it was no longer in our best interest to continue to market the property for sale 
as a result of this decision  the net book value of the kalispell center hotel and mall of million was reclassified from assets held for sale to property and equipment 
a depreciation adjustment of thousand was recorded as of june   reflecting non cash expenses that would have been recognized had the assets been classified as held and used since july following our strategy of divesture of non core assets  we remain committed to the sale of the two spokane office buildings 
we are actively marketing the properties and both are available for sale in their present condition at prices management believes are reasonable compared to their respective estimated fair values 
however  we no longer believe that it is probable that the sale of these assets will be completed in the time frame permissible under generally accepted accounting principles for classification of these assets as held for sale 
as a result of this decision  the net book value of these assets of million was reclassified from assets held for sale to property and equipment 
a depreciation adjustment of million was recorded in september  reflecting non cash expenses that would have been recognized had these assets been classified as property and equipment held and used since december preferred stock dividends on july  we paid a dividend totaling approximately million to the holders of record as of june  of our series a and series b preferred stock  representing all current dividends and dividends that were previously accrued 
we had not paid a dividend due april  to the holders of our series a and series b preferred stock because of restrictions under our previous credit facility relating to anticipatory covenant violations

critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the accounting principles of our company comply with gaap 
the more critical accounting policies and estimates used relate to revenue is generally recognized as services are performed 
hotel and restaurant revenues primarily represent room rental and food and beverage sales from owned  leased and other consolidated hotels and are recognized at the time of the hotel stay or sale of the restaurant services 
hotel and restaurant revenues also include management fees we earn from managing third party owned hotels 
franchise  central services and development fees represent fees received in connection with the franchise of our company s brand name as well as central purchasing  development and other fees 
franchise fees are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the franchise agreements 
other fees are recognized when the services are provided and collection is reasonably assured 
real estate division revenue represents leasing income on owned commercial and retail properties as well as property management income  development fees and leasing and sales commissions from residential and commercial properties managed by our company  typically under long term contracts with the property owner 
lease revenues are recognized over the period of the leases 
we record rental income from operating leases which contain fixed escalation clauses on the straight line method 
the difference between income earned and lease payments received from the tenants is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
rental income from retail leases which is contingent upon the lessees revenues is recorded as income in the period earned 
management fees and leasing and sales commissions are recognized as these services are performed 
the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from computerized event ticketing services and promotion of broadway shows and other special events 
where our company acts as an agent and receives a net fee or commission  it is recognized as revenue in the period the services are performed 
when our company is the promoter of an event and is at risk for the production  revenues and expenses are recorded in the period of the event performance 
property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we also have investments in partnerships that own and operate hotel properties 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make judgments  regarding real estate values  estimated future cash flows from the respective properties and other matters 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we account for assets held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

our company s assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their historical carrying value cost less accumulated depreciation or market value 
depreciation is terminated when the asset is determined to be held for sale 
if the assets are ultimately not sold within the guidelines of sfas no 
 depreciation would be recaptured for the period they were classified on the balance sheet as held for sale 
our company s intangible assets include brands and goodwill 
we account for our brands and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

we expect to 
table of contents receive future benefits from previously acquired brands and goodwill over an indefinite period of time and therefore  effective january   we no longer amortize our brands and goodwill in accordance with sfas no

our other intangible assets include management  marketing and lease contracts 
the value of these contracts is amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average life of the agreements 
the assessment of these contracts requires us to make certain judgments  including estimated future cash flow from the applicable properties 
we review the ability to collect individual accounts receivable on a routine basis 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and amounts that are past due beyond a certain date 
the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
our company s estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts is impacted by  among other things  national and regional economic conditions  including the magnitude and duration of an economic downturn in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates
