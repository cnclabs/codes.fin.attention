item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other parts of this report  the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the statement of income  including trends that might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
please see the risk factors and forward looking statements sections for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview our growth in total revenues during primarily resulted from our acquisition of the primary care business in the united states and puerto rico of elan corporation  plc on june   which includes skelaxin and sonata and our acquisition of meridian medical technologies  inc  on january  we believe that these acquisitions  which include expanded pipeline opportunities  together with the prescription growth potential of many of our existing key products position king for future growth 
sales of key products in the following discussion  net sales for reflect a million charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs for the years to  a million charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs related to and recorded in the fourth quarter of  and a million charge arising from changes made in in accounting estimates for the years to related to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
net sales for reflect an million charge for changes in accounting estimates related to medicaid for the years to and a million charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to medicaid for the years to for additional information  please see the section below entitled governmental investigations  medicaid accrual adjustment  and related matters 
altace net sales of altace grew to million for the year ended december   a increase from million during the prior year 
altace new prescriptions totaled approximately million and total prescriptions equaled approximately million during  increases of and  respectively  over the prior year according to ims america monthly prescription data 
contributing also to the continued sales growth of altace is the sustained shift to mg altace  the same dose used in the landmark heart outcome prevention evaluation  which we refer to as the hope trial 
specifically  total prescriptions for mg altace during increased approximately over the prior year  in comparison to an increase of for the other strengths of altace combined  according to ndc health monthly prescription data 
total net units of altace sold increased for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year 
additionally  price increases contributed to the continued sales growth of altace during based on altace s differentiating indications  positive clinical data and prescription trends  along with our marketing strategies and a composition of matter patent that should protect altace from generic competition through  we anticipate that annual prescriptions of altace should continue to grow  but not necessarily at as high a rate as that achieved in for additional information and a description of anticipated effect of wholesale channel inventory on net sales of altace  please see the section below entitled wholesale channel inventory reductions 
skelaxin and sonata during  we recorded net sales of skelaxin in the amount of million and net sales of sonata totaling million 
we acquired skelaxin and sonata from elan on june  for additional information  see the section entitled strategic developments  elan s primary care business below 
net sales of skelaxin and sonata should increase during  as we will record sales on these products for the entire year 
thrombin jmi net sales of thrombin jmi totaled million in  a increase from million during the prior year 
total net units sold of thrombin jmi increased for the year ended december  from the prior year 
we are near maximum capacity at our facility in madison  wisconsin which will limit our ability to increase unit sales of thrombin jmi during we are currently working on strategies to expand our production capacity for thrombin jmi which should potentially be completed in approximately two years 
we anticipate that annual net sales of thrombin jmi should continue to grow during  but not at as high a rate as that achieved in levoxyl levoxyl net sales were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million during the prior year 
total net units of levoxyl sold decreased for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year 
total prescriptions decreased approximately from to  according to ims america prescription data 
during  wholesale channel inventories of levoxyl were reduced 
if our sales of levoxyl during had been commensurate with the number of units dispensed over the same period according to ims america prescription data  we estimate that our net sales of levoxyl would have been higher than that actually recorded during accordingly  we are anticipating an increase in levoxyl net sales during as sales of the product created by continued demand become more normalized 
wholesale channel inventory reductions in order to facilitate improved management of wholesale channel inventory levels  we are actively engaged in negotiations with our wholesale customers to establish inventory management agreements related to our products 
while we cannot assure that we will successfully negotiate mutually beneficial inventory management agreements  we believe that sales of some of our key products  particularly altace  may be dramatically lower during the first half of  particularly in the first quarter of  than prescription demand would indicate 
research and development our research and development activities involve the discovery and development of chemical compounds  including new chemical entities  which provide us with strategic pipeline opportunities for the commercialization of new branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
in addition to discovering and developing these chemical compounds  we pursue means of enhancing the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that may provide additional benefits to patients  and improvements in the quality and efficiency of our manufacturing processes 
recent fda approvals on june   we received us food and drug administration  which we refer to as the fda  approval of a supplemental new drug application covering pediatric and adult formulations of our nerve gas antidote atropen 
this approval is particularly significant because it is the first time that pediatric formulations of this important homeland security product have been approved for use in the united states 
on october   novavax  inc received fda approval of its new drug application  which we refer to as an nda  for estrasorb tm  a topical estrogen therapy in unique lotion like formulation for symptomatic menopausal women 
we have an exclusive worldwide license to promote  market  distribute  and sell estrasorb tm  except in the united states and puerto rico  where we and novavax will co market the product 
we will share equally with novavax both gross profits from net sales of estrasorb tm and associated costs of promotion within the united states and puerto rico 
novavax will receive royalties on net sales outside of these areas 
novavax  working together with our company  plans to launch estrasorb tm in the united states and puerto rico in the first half of product applications under review by the fda an abbreviated new drug application  which we refer to as an anda  covering our diazepam filled auto injector is presently under review by the fda 
we currently manufacture this product for the military as a treatment for seizures 
once approved  this product will be the only commercially available therapy of its kind for epileptic seizures 
we anticipate fda approval for this product during during the third quarter of  we received an approvable letter for intal hfa from the fda 
intal hfa  a new inhaler formulation of our currently marketed product intal for the long term management of asthma  utilizes the environmentally friendly propellant hydrofluoroalkane  which we refer to as hfa 
with a patent that extends through september  intal hfa is an important product line extension 
sonata extended release formulation we commenced our phase ii clinical trial program for an extended release formulation of sonata  a nonbenzodiazepine treatment for insomnia  in march the phase ii clinical trial program is designed to select the most effective extended release formulation of sonata utilizing elan s commercially proven spheroidal oral drug absorption system  which we refer to as sodas  as the drug delivery technology 
the goal of the phase ii clinical trial program is to determine which new formulation is the most efficacious for the purpose of increasing total sleep time and reducing any potential for premature awakenings  while continuing to build upon the quick onset profile currently available in the immediate release formulation of sonata 
with us patent coverage that extends to  the extended release formulation should establish sonata as a long term cornerstone product for our company 
moreover  this development program should provide us with the opportunity to procure additional patents potentially covering  among other things  unique biopharmaceutical characteristics and methods of use related to the extended release formulation of sonata 
altace product life cycle projects we entered into a licensing agreement with skyepharma plc in may for the purpose of developing and commercializing a modified release formulation of our altace product utilizing skyepharma s patented oral drug delivery technology geomatrix 
skyepharma s geomatrix range of technologies involves a fully developed  multi layered tablet technology that controls the release of a product s active ingredient for the purpose of optimizing a drug s pharmacokinetic behavior 
the specific geomatrix technology planned for use in the development of a modified release formulation of altace should provide the product with extended duration of action and improved bioavailability 
skyepharma has various issued patents covering the geomatrix drug delivery technologies  with us patent protection extending to also  skyepharma has patent applications for additional patents under review covering its geomatrix drug delivery technologies 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed enrollment in the ongoing phase iv clinical trial to determine the safety and effectiveness of altace in the treatment of hypertension high blood pressure in children 
this important trial  which we refer to as tophat treatment of pediatric hypertension with altace trial  is scheduled to conclude by the end of binodenoson on december   we commenced the pivotal phase iii clinical trial program involving binodenoson 
binodenoson is an adenosine aa receptor agonist that we are developing for cardiac pharmacologic stress spect imaging  a procedure used to diagnose the presence and severity of coronary artery disease 
the data from the phase ii dose ranging study indicates that binodenoson  at effective doses  is better tolerated than adenosine  the current market leader  which was previously developed by king 
approximately million pharmacologic stress tests are performed in the united states each year to diagnose heart disease in patients who cannot perform traditional exercise stress tests 
adenosine and dipyridamole are the current agents of choice to achieve the coronary vasodilation necessary for cardiac imaging in the united states  but these drugs do not distinguish between the four subtypes of adenosine receptors 
our phase ii clinical trials showed that by targeting the adenosine aa receptor subtype  binodenoson appears to detect myocardial ischemia as well as adenosine  and produces fewer and less severe side effects like heart block  dyspnea and chest pain than adenosine and dipyridamole 
unlike the currently used drugs  which are administered over to minutes  binodenoson will be given as an intravenous bolus dose 
this advantage  coupled with the improved safety profile  promises to make these diagnostic tests safer for patients and easier and more efficient for physicians to administer 
t during the fourth quarter of  we commenced the phase i clinical trial program for t  a new chemical entity that we are developing as a potential treatment for neuropathic pain 
when given orally  t enhances the effect of endogenous adenosine in the spinal cord and should provide effective relief for neuropathic pain by the same mechanism as intrathecally administered adenosine 
adenosine  a neurotransmitter that affects the adenosine a receptors in the spinal cord to normalize the pain response  has been shown to be an effective treatment for neuropathic pain when injected into the spinal cord via intrathecal administration 
the initial phase i trial for t is a single center  randomized double blind  placebo controlled evaluation of the safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral doses of this new chemical entity in healthy adult subjects 
mre mre  a new chemical entity  is an adenosine aa receptor agonist that we are developing as a potential topical treatment for chronic diabetic foot ulcers 
this product is designed to utilize a novel approach to treating this condition by concentrating on the inflammation associated with such foot ulcers 
adenosine aa receptor agonists have been shown to promote wound closure in mice and diabetes induced rats by regulating the response of inflammatory cells and mediators  promoting tissue formation through various mechanisms including endothelial cell proliferation and migration  and promoting tissue remodeling 
in january we completed the dosing of the initial concentration of mre in our ongoing phase i clinical trial program evaluating the safety of the drug in patients 
strategic developments elan s primary care business on june   we acquired the primary care business of elan and that of some of its subsidiaries  in the united states and puerto rico  including the rights to sonata and skelaxin and the rights pertaining to potential new formulations of these products  together with elan s united states primary care field sales force 
product rights subject to the agreement include those related to sonata  a nonbenzodiazepine treatment for insomnia  and skelaxin  a muscle relaxant  in the united states  its territories and possessions  and puerto rico 
under the terms of the agreement  elan s sale of skelaxin included related ndas  copyrights  trademarks  patents and rights pertaining to potential new formulations of skelaxin 
elan s sale of sonata included its rights to the product  as well as certain related copyrights and us rights to potential new formulations of sonata 
we also acquired certain intellectual property  regulatory  and other assets relating to sonata directly from wyeth 
under the terms of the agreement  we secured an exclusive license to the intellectual property rights in this territory of both wyeth and elan to the extent they relate to new formulations of sonata  other than for use in animals 
the total estimated purchase price was million  which included the cost of acquisition  assumed liabilities and a portion of contingent liabilities 
the purchase price also includes the transfer of inventory with a value of approximately million 
in addition to the initial purchase price  we paid million during january as a milestone payment to elan relating to the continued exclusivity of skelaxin and we paid million during march  as a milestone payment to elan in connection with the development of new formulations of sonata 
we also will pay royalties on the current formulation of skelaxin from the date of closing  will pay up to an additional million if elan achieves certain milestones in connection with the development of a reformulated version of sonata  will pay million as a milestone payment to elan if annual net sales of a reformulated version of sonata exceed million and will pay for costs associated with the development of the reformulated version of sonata 
meridian medical technologies  inc on january   we completed our acquisition of meridian  for a cash price totaling million 
meridian pioneered the development  and is a leading manufacturer  of auto injectors for the self administration of injectable drugs 
an auto injector is a pre filled  pen like device that allows a patient or caregiver to automatically inject a precise drug dosage quickly  easily  safely  and reliably 
this acquisition provides us with additional lines of growing exclusive pharmaceutical products  auto injector technology  and enhanced pipeline opportunities 
meridian s growing commercial pharmaceutical business primarily consists of epipen  an auto injector filled with epinephrine for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis resulting from severe or allergic reactions to insect stings or bites  foods  drugs  and other allergens  as well as idiopathic or exercise induced anaphylaxis 
dey lp markets epipen pursuant to a supply agreement that expires december  under the terms of the supply agreement  we grant dey the exclusive right and license to market  distribute  and sell epipen worldwide 
meridian also has growing lines of pharmaceutical products that are presently sold primarily to the us department of defense  also known as the dod  under an industrial base maintenance contract 
these products include atropen and combopen which are nerve agent antidotes 
atropen is an atropine filled auto injector and combopen consists of an atropine filled auto injector and a pralidoxime filled auto injector 
other products sold to the dod include a diazepam filled auto injector for the treatment of seizures and a morphine filled auto injector for pain management 
additionally  in january  meridian began selling a new auto injector to the dod called the antidote treatment nerve agent auto injector  which we refer to as atnaa 
atnaa  also a nerve agent antidote  utilizes a dual chambered auto injector and injection process to administer atropine and pralidoxime  which provides an improved  more efficient means of delivering these nerve agent antidotes 
the atnaa auto injector and injection process has us patent coverage that extends to april  governmental investigations  medicaid accrual adjustment  and related matters as previously reported  in march the securities and exchange commission  which we refer to as the sec  initiated a formal investigation of our company 
we received sec subpoenas relating to  among other topics  sales of our products to vitarx and prison health services  our best price lists  the pricing of our pharmaceutical products provided to governmental medicaid agencies  the accrual and payment of rebates on the product altace  the products fluogen and lorabid  the king benevolent fund  inc  our calculations related to medicaid rebates  and our audit committee s internal review of issues raised by the sec investigation 
as also previously reported  on november   we received a subpoena duces tecum from the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services requesting the production of documents relating to some of the matters being investigated by the sec and to our sales  marketing and other business practices for altace  aplisol and levoxyl 
in march  upon the recommendation of our management and with the assistance of independent counsel and an independent accounting firm  the audit committee of our board of directors initiated an assessment and internal review of issues raised by the sec investigation 
in connection with the internal review  we estimated that we had underpaid amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  and recorded an adjustment of million to net sales and accrued expenses in the fourth quarter of this amount represented our best estimate as of july of the extent to which we had underpaid amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to the july estimate was based upon an extensive sample of available data supporting the calculation of medicaid rebates paid from to  and was generated with the assistance of outside consultants 
since that time  our outside consultants have undertaken a comprehensive audit to determine the actual amount of underpayments under medicaid during the period from to as a result of that recently completed audit  we have determined that our accrual for estimated amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs through december   should be increased by million 
in addition  based on the results of the comprehensive audit for the period from through  we estimate that we underpaid amounts due medicaid by million during the period from through accordingly  results for the fourth quarter of include an adjustment of million to net sales and accrued expenses 
following the accrual adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of  we recovered on a pre tax basis approximately million in fees we previously paid under our co promotion agreement for altace  and have reduced the accrual for these fees by this amount in the fourth quarter of in addition  fees under our co promotion agreement for altace in the fourth quarter of were reduced on a pre tax basis by approximately million as a result of the accrual adjustment recorded in that quarter 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the million adjustment in our accrual for medicaid rebates for the period from through constitutes a change in an accounting estimate effective as of december  the change resulted principally from two factors 
first  the recently completed medicaid audit included additional data that was used to refine the july estimate 
second  we received legal advice that  in calculating amounts payable under medicaid  we should revise the methodology we had previously been advised to use for calculating best price in respect of a complex issue concerning rebates to pharmacy benefit managers 
the million adjustment in our accrual for medicaid rebates for the period from through reflects the correction of immaterial errors that occurred during that period 
the medicaid audit did not result in any changes to our accruals for programs other than medicaid 
we are currently in the process of conducting detailed audits of our compliance with the requirements of several other governmental pricing programs  but our obligations under these programs are substantially less than our obligations under medicaid  and we do not expect the audits to result in material adjustments to our accruals 
although the amounts described above constitute our best estimate of amounts owed in respect of medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  our calculations are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies 
in connection with the pending governmental investigations  we have continued to engage in discussions with representatives of the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  the department of justice  the department of veterans affairs  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  and the public health service 
we expect that these discussions will include a detailed review of our calculations by the appropriate agencies  and it is possible that this review could result in material changes 
the accruals described above relate solely to our estimated underpayments and exclude any interest  fines  penalties or other amounts that might be owed in connection with the underpayments  as we cannot predict or reasonably estimate their likelihood or magnitude at this time 
pending determination of the precise amount of our obligations  we have placed a total of million in an interest bearing escrow account 
in addition  since the first quarter of  we voluntarily have been making our medicaid payments on a basis that we believe represents an overpayment of amounts actually due  and we would expect to offset these payments against the amounts ultimately determined to be due in respect of prior years 
based on the results of our medicaid audit  we estimate that these overpayments total approximately million as of december  the governmental investigations of king described above are continuing 
the sec  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  the department of justice  the department of veterans affairs  the public health service  the centers for medicare and medicaid services and other governmental agencies that might be investigating or might commence an investigation of us could impose  based on a claim of a violation of fraud and false claims laws or otherwise  civil and or criminal sanctions  including fines  penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs including medicaid and medicare 
some of these laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud 
we cannot predict or reasonably estimate the likelihood or magnitude of any such sanctions at this time 
for additional information  please see section entitled the risk factors under the heading if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid rebate program or other governmental pricing programs  we could be subject to additional reimbursements  penalties  sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
subsequent to the announcement of the sec investigation described above  beginning in march  purported class action complaints were filed by holders of our securities against us  our directors  former directors  executive officers  former executive officers  a subsidiary  and a former director of the subsidiary in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  alleging violations of the securities act of and or the securities exchange act of these complaints have been consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee 
in addition  holders of our securities filed two class action complaints alleging violations of the securities act of in tennessee state court 
we removed these two cases to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  where these two cases were consolidated with the other class actions 
plaintiffs in these actions unsuccessfully moved to remand these two cases back to tennessee state court 
these two actions therefore remain part of the consolidated action 
the district court has appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action  and those lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on october  alleging that we  through some of our executive officers  former executive officers  directors and former directors  made false or misleading statements concerning our business  financial condition and results of operations during periods beginning february  and continuing until march  plaintiffs in the consolidated action have also named the underwriters of our november public offering as defendants 
we and other defendants have filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint  and those motions are currently pending 
seven purported shareholder derivative complaints have also been filed in federal and state courts in tennessee alleging a breach of fiduciary duty  among other things  by some of our officers and directors 
the derivative cases in state court were consolidated and are currently stayed 
the stay will remain in place at least until the motions to dismiss the consolidated federal securities class action are decided 
the derivative cases in federal court are stayed until there is a decision on the merits in the state court derivative suits 
additionally  a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee under erisa 
as amended  the complaint alleges that we and certain of our executive officers  former executive officers  directors  former directors and an employee violated fiduciary duties that we allegedly owed our k retirement savings plan s participants and beneficiaries under erisa 
the allegations underlying each of these additional lawsuits are similar in many respects to those in the class action litigation described above 
we filed a motion to dismiss the erisa action on march   this motion to dismiss is currently pending 
we intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously but are unable currently to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential loss  if any 
if any governmental sanctions are imposed  or if we were not to prevail in the pending litigation  neither of which we can predict or reasonably estimate at this time  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
responding to the government investigations  resolving the amounts owed to governmental agencies in connection with the underpayments and defending us in the pending litigation has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees 
for additional information  please see the risk factors section under the heading the governmental investigations and pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as previously disclosed  we determined in july as a result of the audit committee s internal review that we needed to dedicate additional resources to ensure compliance with all applicable reporting requirements for medicaid rebates and other governmental pricing programs 
we have recently implemented a new information technology system which better enables us to collect and process data needed to more precisely determine our obligations under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
although the new information technology system is intended to significantly enhance the accuracy of our calculations for estimating amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  our processes for these calculations and judgments involved in making these calculations continue to involve subjective decisions and manual input  and  as a result  these calculations remain subject to the risk of errors arising from manual processes 
additionally  notwithstanding this increased automation  compliance with the requirements of government pricing programs will continue to require that we make judgments and estimates with respect to complex matters as to which there may be little or no regulatory or legal guidance 
in addition to improvements to our systems  we have made several important hires  and we are continuing to search for and hire additional qualified personnel 
we have also established a corporate compliance office  and are in the process of implementing a compliance program intended to comport with guidance issued by the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services 
we are committed to further enhancements and continue to identify and implement actions that improve our compliance with medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
the audit committee has stated that it intends to monitor carefully our ongoing discussions with appropriate regulatory authorities  as well as the implementation of proposed improvements to systems  processes  training and personnel

cobalt has filed a paragraph iv certification alleging invalidity of the patent  and we filed suit on march  to enforce our rights under that patent 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the filing of that suit provides us an automatic stay of fda approval of cobalt s anda for months from no earlier than february  should the court find in favor of a cobalt summary judgment motion on the patent  however  we would not receive the full benefit of that month stay 
subsequent to filing our original complaint  we amended our complaint to add an allegation of infringement of the patent 
in its answer to the amended complaint  cobalt denied infringement and alleged that the patent is invalid 
pursuant to fda regulations  however  cobalt is not required to certify against the patent 
we intend to vigorously enforce our rights under the and patents 
regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit involving the and patents  however  cobalt has not challenged the validity of the patent and  therefore  cannot market a generic version of altace prior to the expiration of that patent in january levoxyl patent challenge mylan pharmaceuticals  inc and kv pharmaceutical company have each filed an anda with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of levoxyl 
united states patent no 
 the patent  a utility patent with formulation claims relating to levoxyl  was issued to us on april  the patent is listed in the fda s orange book and does not expire until february  no earlier than april   we received notice of mylan s paragraph iv certification  which alleges noninfringement of the patent

on march   we received a copy of a letter from the fda to all anda applicants for skelaxin stating that the use listed in the fda s orange book for the patent may be deleted from the anda applicants product labeling 
we believe that this decision is arbitrary  capricious  and inconsistent with the fda s previous position on this issue 
we are currently assessing our administrative and legal options and may request the fda to reinstate its previous policy on this issue and reject any andas that delete such use from their product labeling 
if we are unable to persuade the fda to reinstate its previous policy  however  there is a substantial likelihood that a generic version of skelaxin will enter the market  and our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

women s health initiative clinical trial an ongoing clinical trial  the women s health initiative  is being conducted by the national institutes of health 
data from that trial released in july indicated that an increase in certain health risks may result from the long term use of a competitor s combination hormone replacement therapy for women 
news of this data and the perception it has created have negatively affected the entire combination hormone therapy and the oral estrogen therapy  which include our products prefest  delestrogen and menest and may affect our future marketing efforts for estrasorb 
total net sales of these women s health products  together with nordette  an oral contraceptive  decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease from million during the year ended december  total prescriptions for these products decreased an average of during  in comparison to lorabid we acquired the antibiotic lorabid in the united states and puerto rico from eli lilly and company on august  for a purchase price of million  including acquisition costs 
since the acquisition  sales have declined for a variety of reasons 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to divest our rights to lorabid 
also during the fourth quarter of  based on our management s cash flow expectations  we determined that the lorabid intangible assets were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the assets to their estimated fair value 
additionally  based on estimated prescription trends  we believe our minimum purchase commitments under our supply agreement with eli lilly for lorabid were greater than the amount we would be able to sell to our customers 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of we also recorded a million charge related to the liability associated with the amount of our purchase commitments in excess of expected demand 
due to the continued decline in prescriptions for lorabid  we recorded an additional million charge during the fourth quarter of related to the liability associated with the amount of our purchase commitments in excess of expected demand 
as of december   our net intangible assets related to lorabid equal million 
in addition  there is million of remaining exposure related to the supply agreement 
intangible asset issues related to some non key products and our rochester facility on march   the fda approved impax labs anda for fludrocortisone acetate tablets  a generic for florinef 
on january   the fda approved barr laboratories anda for a second generic for florinef 
as of december   we had intangible assets related to florinef with carrying values of million 
during the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million reflecting the reduction in the fair value of the florinef intangible assets 
we determined the fair value of our florinef product based on management s discounted cash flow projections for the product 
as of december   we had net intangible assets related to florinef of approximately million 
if prescriptions for florinef continue to decline  we may incur additional asset impairment charges related to this product in the future 
in march  we also became aware that an anda for cortisporin ophthalmic suspension which was previously inactive  has been reactivated by the fda with a new sponsor 
we understand the sponsor entered the market as of april  with a generic equivalent for cortisporin ophthalmic suspension 
the entry of the generic has negatively affected our market share for this product 
as of december   we have net intangible assets related to our cortisporin product line in the approximate amount of million 
management currently believes that this asset is not impaired based on estimated undiscounted cash flows  however  if prescription declines exceed current expectations  we may have to write off a portion or all of the intangible assets associated with those products in the future 
prescriptions for our women s health products  particularly nordette and prefest  have continued to decline over the past year 
as of december   the nordette and prefest products have net intangible assets associated with them of million and million  respectively

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the implementation of this standard did not have any effect on our financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which we refer to as fin 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is required to absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we are in the process of assessing what impact this pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
based on our preliminary analysis of the impact of fin  we believe that it is reasonably possible that novavax could be a variable interest entity and our interest in novavax may require us to consolidate novavax in the first quarter of during the period from december through june  we provided million in financing to novavax in the form of notes receivable convertible to common stock of novavax 
in addition  during  we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to promote  market  distribute and sell estrasorb tm and androsorb tm  following approval  except in the united states and puerto rico  where we and novavax will co market the products 
once approved  we will pay novavax a royalty based on a percentage of net sales of the products outside of the united states and puerto rico 
novavax will pay us a co promotion fee equal to of net sales less cost of revenues of the products within the united states and puerto rico 
the nda for estrasorb tm was approved by the fda during october as of december   we owned approximately of novavax common stock 
at september   novavax reported total assets of million  total liabilities of million  revenues for the nine months ended september  of million  and a net loss of million for the nine months ended september  critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions 
assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by such estimates and assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are employed in estimates used in determining values of inventories and intangible assets  accruals for rebates  returns and chargebacks  as well as estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those estimates  such as changes in the healthcare environment  competition  legislation and regulation 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical because they involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate all of our inventory for short dated or slow moving product and inventory commitments under supply agreements based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we provide a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
we maintain supply agreements with some of our vendors which contain minimum purchase requirements 
we estimate future inventory requirements based on current facts and trends 
should our minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements or if our estimated future inventory requirements exceed estimated inventory quantities which we will be able to sell to our customers  we record a charge in costs of revenues 
intangible assets  goodwill  and other long lived assets 
when we acquire product rights in conjunction with either business or asset acquisitions  we allocate an appropriate portion of the purchase price to intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
the purchase price is allocated to product rights and trademarks  patents  acquired research and development and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation experts 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
we review our property and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review our goodwill for possible impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
accruals for rebates  returns  and chargebacks 
we establish accruals for rebates  returns  and chargebacks in the same period we recognize the related sales 
the accruals reduce revenues and are included in accrued expenses 
accrued rebates include amounts due under medicaid  managed care rebates and other commercial contractual rebates 
we estimate accrued rebates based on a percentage of selling price determined from historical experience 
with respect to accruals for estimated medicaid rebates  we evaluate our historical rebate payments by product as a percentage of historical sales  product pricing and current contracts 
at the time of rebate payment  which generally occurs with a delay after the related sale  we record a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjust accrued expenses for any differences between estimated and actual payments 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of the rebate  rebate payments remain subject to retroactive adjustment 
returns are accrued based on historical experience 
chargebacks are based on the estimated days of unprocessed claims using historical experience 
in all cases  judgment is required in estimating these reserves  and actual claims for rebates  returns and chargebacks could be different from the estimates 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  collection of sales is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customer 
accruals for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks  determined based on historical experience  reduce revenues at the time of sale and are included in accrued expenses 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
royalty revenue is recognized based on a percentage of sales namely  contractually agreed upon royalty rates reported by third parties 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
for the year ended december   we deferred recognition of revenue associated with a purchase of our products by the king benevolent fund 
we have and will recognize the deferred revenue as the purchased products are distributed by the king benevolent fund 
see the certain relationships and related transactions in item and note  related party transactions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks  including interest rate risk 
our financial instruments are not currently subject to foreign currency risk or commodity price risk 
we have no financial instruments held for trading purposes 
we have marketable securities which are carried at fair value based on current market quotes 
gains and losses on securities are based on the specific identification method 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates rise and decrease as interest rates fall 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible debentures would be impacted by our stock price 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease  the fair value of our long term debt would increase or decrease by approximately million 
at december   and  we did not hold any derivative financial instruments
