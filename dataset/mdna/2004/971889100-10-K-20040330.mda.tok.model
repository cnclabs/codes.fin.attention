   average sales prices oil per bbl 








gas per mfc 









average production costs per boe sales prices received by the company for oil and gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
the fluctuations in oil prices during these periods primarily reflected market uncertainty regarding the inability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to control the production of its member countries  as well as concerns related to global supply and demand for crude oil

critical accounting policies wilshire s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon wilshire s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires wilshire to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
wilshire bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
oil and gas properties the company follows the accounting policy  generally known in the oil and gas industry as full cost accounting 
under full cost accounting  the company capitalizes all costs  including interest costs  relating to the exploration for and development of its mineral resources 
under this method  all costs incurred in the united states and canada are accumulated in separate cost centers and are amortized using the gross revenue method based on total future estimated recoverable oil and gas reserves 
the determination of oil and gas reserves is a complex and interpretive process  which is subject to continued revisions as additional information becomes available 
therefore  the reserve data presented herein should not be construed as being exact 
any reserve estimate depends in part on the quality of available data  engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment  and thus  represents only an informed professional judgment 
subsequent reservoir performance may justify upward or downward revision of the estimate 
capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value  using a discount rate of of the future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
management is of the opinion that  based on reserve reports of petroleum engineers and geologists  the fair value of the estimated recoverable oil and gas reserves exceeds the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties at december  no ceiling test was performed as of december   as the company s oil and gas businesses have been reported as discontinued operations 
see item  business oil and gas properties reserves 
the company recognized a non cash charge of million  net of taxes  in its income statement as a result of a difference between the carrying value of its canadian oil and gas business and the estimated market value of that business

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

the company adopted this pronouncement on january  this adoption had no impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
management does not believe at december  and that the value of any of its rental properties is impaired 
revenue recognition revenue from oil and gas properties is recognized at the time these products are delivered to third party purchasers 
revenue from real estate properties is recognized during the period in which the premises are occupied and rent is due from tenant 
rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in accounts receivable 
an allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained based on the company s estimate of the inability of its joint interest partners in the oil and gas division and its tenants in the real estate division to make required payments 
foreign operations the assets and liabilities of the company s canadian subsidiary have been translated at year end exchange rates 
the related revenues and expenses have been translated at average annual exchange rates 
the aggregate effect of translation losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investment

estimated future development and production costs are determined by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year  based on year end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions

these estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of the financial accounting standards board and the sec
