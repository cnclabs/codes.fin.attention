this estimate is subject to revisions until the valuations of oes s assets and liabilities are finalized 
the operating results of oes have been included in the company s consolidated operating results since the date of acquisition

our revenues are derived from two principal sources service revenues and sales revenues 
service revenues are generally earned pursuant to multi year contracts to provide instant ticket and related services and on line and pari mutuel wagering systems and services  or are derived from wagering by customers at facilities we own or lease 
we believe our service revenues are recurring in nature 
sales revenues are derived from sales of prepaid phone cards and from the sale of wagering systems  equipment  and software licenses 
we operate primarily in four business segments lottery group  pari mutuel group  venue management group and telecommunications products group 
our lottery group derives revenues from the sale of instant lottery tickets and related services and the sale or operation of on line lottery systems 
in  our lottery group accounted for approximately of all retail sales of instant lottery tickets in the united states 
in the instant ticket business  we typically sell our tickets for a per unit price or are paid a fee equal to a percentage of the retail value of the instant tickets sold by a state lottery 
in the on line lottery market in the united states  we are generally paid a fee equal to a percentage of all dollars wagered on lottery tickets  in international markets  we generally sell our lottery systems to the lottery operators 
on line lottery refers to a computerized system in which lottery terminals in retail outlets are continuously connected to a central computer system for the sale and validation of lottery tickets and related functions 
our lottery group provides instant tickets and related services and lottery systems 
instant ticket and related services includes ticket design and manufacturing as well as value added services  including game design  sales and marketing support  inventory management and warehousing and fulfillment services 
in addition  this division includes promotional instant tickets and pull tab tickets that we sell to both lottery and non lottery customers 
our lottery systems business includes the supply of transaction processing software for the accounting and validation of both instant ticket and on line lottery games  point of sale terminal hardware sales  central site computers and communication hardware sales  and ongoing support and maintenance services for these products 
this business line also includes software  hardware and support service for sports betting and credit card processing systems 
we have contracts to operate on line lottery systems for of the on line lottery authorities in the us  and we believe we are the second largest on line lottery provider in europe 
our pari mutuel group is a leading worldwide provider of wagering systems to the pari mutuel wagering industry  to which we also provide related race broadcasting and telecommunications services 
our pari mutuel group is comprised of our north american and international on track  off track and inter track pari mutuel services  simulcasting and communications services  and video gaming  as well as sales of pari mutuel systems and equipment 
we provide our systems and services to thoroughbred  harness and greyhound racetracks  otbs  casinos  jai alai frontons and other establishments where pari mutuel wagering is permitted 
we are generally paid a percentage of all racing industry wagers  or handle  processed by our wagering systems  and we receive a service fee for our satellite communications services on a per event or a monthly subscription basis 
in  our systems processed approximately of the estimated billion in pari mutuel wagering conducted on racing in north america 
our venue management group includes our connecticut otb operations and our dutch on track and off track betting operations 
our telecommunications products group is comprised of our prepaid cellular phone card business 
the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year traditionally comprise the weakest seasons for our pari mutuel wagering businesses 
as a result of inclement weather during the winter months  a number of racetracks do not operate and those that do operate often experience missed racing days 
this adversely affects the amounts wagered and our corresponding service revenues 
wagering equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions  which do not recur on an annual basis 
consequently  revenues and operating results can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales and software license revenue 
in addition  instant ticket and prepaid phone card sales may vary depending on the season and timing of contract awards  changes in customer budgets  ticket inventory levels  lottery retail sales and general economic conditions 
operating results may also vary significantly from period to period depending on the addition or disposition of business units in each period 
the acquisition of of the equity of serchi in  the acquisition of mdi in january and the acquisition of oes in november  all of which were accounted for as purchases  affect the comparability of operations from period to period see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we transferred the listing for our class a common stock to the nasdaq national market  and our trading symbol was changed to sgms 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as accounting policies critical to us revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes and management estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred 
almost all of our revenues  except revenues earned from the sale of wagering systems  are earned pursuant to contractual terms and conditions either as a percentage of the amount wagered or when products are shipped to the customer and the customer assumes ownership of the product 
such revenues do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenues from fixed price contracts to provide wagering systems including equipment and software licenses are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete with revisions to estimated costs reflected in the period in which changes become known 
anticipated losses on fixed price contracts are recognized when the losses can be estimated 
recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion method requires us to make estimates regarding the resources required or the scope of work to be performed 
if we do not accurately estimate the extent of work to be performed  manage our projects properly or complete our contracts within the specified time period  we may experience changes in revenues and resulting reductions in margins or losses on our contracts in subsequent periods 
at the time we enter into service or sales contracts  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of our fee is due beyond our normal payment terms  which may vary depending on the nature of the contract and location of the customer  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable and recognize the revenue when payments become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
for our international customers  we frequently require collateral in the form of a letter of credit for all or a portion of our fee 
if we determine collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize the revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate equal to our weighted average cost of capital  or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
at december   the net carrying value of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill amounted to approximately million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives as of january  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and sfas require that we evaluate our existing goodwill and intangible assets and make any necessary reclassifications to conform with the new criteria outlined in sfas and sfas we completed our assessment of goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter of  and we made all necessary reclassifications to goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no material adjustments were made to the goodwill and intangible assets balances at december  we also evaluated the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets that will continue to be amortized and have determined that no revision to those useful lives is necessary 
we performed an annual impairment test for fiscal and  and no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as of december  or income taxes income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under this method  deferred income taxes are calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates to cumulative temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
under sfas  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
prior to  we had a history of losses  which generated sizable net operating loss carryforwards for both state and federal tax purposes 
we did not recognize any income tax benefits from those losses in excess of the amount of net taxable temporary differences that would reverse during the carryforward period because we were not able to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize some or all of these net operating losses  and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance offsetting our deferred tax asset associated with these losses 
because of improved financial results in  and anticipated taxable income in and beyond  it was determined that it was more likely than not that we would utilize our tax losses to offset future taxable income considering any limitations on the use of our tax losses imposed by the internal revenue code of as a result  we recorded a deferred tax asset in of approximately million by reducing the corresponding deferred income tax valuation allowance  and recognized an income tax benefit in income from continuing operations 
should our expectations for future levels of taxable income not materialize or occur in amounts significantly less than what we have forecasted  some of our deferred tax assets may not be recoverable 
a significant change in our expectations for future taxable income could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management involve percentage of completion for contracted lottery and pari mutuel wagering systems  as discussed above  evaluation of the recoverability of assets including accounts receivable  inventories and long lived assets and the assessment of litigation and contingencies  and income taxes 
management specifically evaluates the recoverability of accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  past collection experiences with specific customers  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we do not require our customers to provide collateral for services provided pursuant to our service contracts 
for sales of equipment and wagering systems to international customers we generally require that no less than a significant portion of the amounts to be paid be collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit 
changes in the underlying financial condition of our customers could result in a material impact to our results of operation and financial position 
our inventory consists principally of parts and finished goods to which we provide a reserve for obsolete and slow moving items 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by reviewing historical rates of scrap  on hand quantities as compared to historical and projected usage levels  orders for new equipment  and contractual requirements to service our installed base of equipment 
we record a liability pertaining to pending litigation based on our best estimate of a potential loss  if any  or at the minimum end of the range of loss in circumstances where the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the ultimate liability to us  if any  we continually revise our estimated losses as additional facts become known 
related party transactions statement of financial accounting standards no 
 related party disclosures  requires us to identify and describe material transactions involving related persons or entities and to disclose information necessary to understand the effects of such transactions on our consolidated financial statements 
we are not a party to material transactions involving related persons or entities 
reclassification of previously reported extraordinary item effective january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas rescinds statement no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect  and requires the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
to be used to classify gains and losses 
accordingly  in  we reclassified the extraordinary losses incurred in to early extinguishment of debt 
these debt extinguishments totaled approximately million of pre tax expense in certain other reclassifications were made to the prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to the current presentation

because of improved financial results in  and anticipated taxable income in and beyond  it was determined that it was more likely than not that we would utilize our tax losses to offset future taxable income considering any limitations on the use of our tax losses imposed by the internal revenue code of as a result  we recorded a deferred tax asset in of approximately million by reducing the corresponding deferred income tax valuation allowance  and recognized an income tax benefit in income from continuing operations

additionally  the credit agreement governing the facility contains the following financial covenants  which are computed quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis as applicable a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of  which will be reduced according to the terms of the credit agreement through july   from which date until december the ratio shall be 
consolidated leverage ratio means the ratio of x the aggregate stated balance sheet amount of our indebtedness determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with gaap as of the last day of the fiscal quarter for which such determination is being made to y consolidated ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which such determination is being made 
a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of  which will be increased according to the terms of the credit agreement through july   from which date until december the ratio shall be 
consolidated interest coverage ratio means the ratio computed for our four most recent fiscal quarters of x consolidated ebitda to y total interest expense less non cash amortization costs included in interest expense 
a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of  which will be increased according to the terms of the credit agreement through july   from which date until december the ratio shall be 
consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio means  as of any date of determination  the ratio computed for our four most recent fiscal quarters of x consolidated ebitda to y the sum of i total interest expense less non cash amortization costs included in interest expense  ii scheduled payments of principal on indebtedness  iii certain restricted payments and iv all income taxes paid in cash 
a maximum consolidated senior debt ratio of  which will be reduced according to the terms of the credit agreement through july   from which date until december the ratio shall be 
consolidated senior debt ratio means the ratio of x the aggregate stated balance sheet amount of our indebtedness  less the amount of notes  determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with gaap as of the last day of the fiscal quarter for which such determination is being made to y consolidated ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which such determination is being made 
for purposes of the foregoing limitations  consolidated ebitda means the sum of i consolidated net income  ii consolidated interest expense with respect to all outstanding indebtedness  iii provisions for taxes based on income  iv total depreciation expense  v total amortization expense and vi certain adjustments  in each case for the period being measured  all of the foregoing as determined on a consolidated basis for us and our subsidiaries in accordance with gaap 
although we were in compliance with our loan covenants at december  and expect to continue to remain in compliance over the next months  no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to continue to meet the covenant requirements beyond months 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  but no outstanding borrowings under the facility  leaving us with a total availability of million as compared to million at december  our ability to borrow under the facility will depend on our remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our lenders  including the maintenance of the specified financial covenants 
presently we have not sought and  therefore  do not have any other financing commitments 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and future minimum operating lease obligations  as set forth in the table below cash payments due by period contractual obligations total within year years years after years in thousands long term debt  notes and facility    other long term debt    interest expense      operating leases      other long term liabilities     total contractual cash obligations     based on rates in effect at december  because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments  we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our pension plans and deferred compensation plans aggregating  at december  we have also excluded liabilities aggregating  at december   related to deferred revenues  deferred income taxes and minority interests in businesses we own 
our series a preferred stock requires dividend payments at a rate of per annum 
to date  we have satisfied the dividend requirement using additional shares of convertible preferred stock 
the terms of the convertible preferred stock provide us with the flexibility to satisfy the dividend in cash  subject to compliance with the facility  which we expect to initiate in our pari mutuel wagering and on line lottery systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
our primary expenditures associated with these services are personnel and related costs  which are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses services in the consolidated statements of operations 
historically  the revenues we derive from our service contracts have exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations under these pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems service contracts 
we expect that we will continue to realize positive cash flow and operating income as we extend or renew existing service contracts 
we also expect that we will enter into new contracts that are accretive to our cash flow 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are continually deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies will continue to positively impact our future cash flows and operating results 
we are not party to any other material short term or long term obligations or commitments pursuant to these service contracts 
periodically  we bid on new pari mutuel and on line lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant up front capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically we have funded these up front costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to procure new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to enter into additional borrowings at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial up front costs 
once operational  long term service contracts have been accretive to our operating cash flow 
for fiscal  we anticipate that capital expenditures and software expenditures will be approximately million 
however  the actual level of expenditures will ultimately depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
the amount of capital expenditures in fiscal and beyond will largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
furthermore  our pari mutuel wagering network consists of approximately  wagering terminals 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
we presently have no commitments to replace our existing terminal base and our obligation to upgrade the terminals is discretionary 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory quantities to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations 
at december   our available cash and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  our available cash and borrowing capacities fluctuate principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  repayment of our outstanding debt and changes in our working capital position 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of million exceeded cash used in investing activities of million  excluding funds used to acquire mdi and oes 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities consisted of the excess of the million that was provided by operations less the million that was used to fund changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from increases in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under the facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future  however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
while we are not aware of any particular trends  our contracts periodically renew and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced any difficulty obtaining such bonds  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while we are not aware of any reason to do so  if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  including our senior subordinated notes  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  including the facility and our senior subordinated notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 consolidated financial statements  to address consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities previously often referred to as special purpose entities  which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  or the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses 
interpretation no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company does not have any variable interest rate entities  and we do not expect that interpretation no 
will have an impact on our financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements eitf 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
it also addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early application permitted 
companies may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
we believe that our current accounting is consistent with the provisions of eitf on march   the fasb added to its agenda a project that will seek to improve the accounting and disclosures relating to stock based compensation 
among other issues  the project on stock based compensation will address whether to require that the cost of employee stock options be treated as an expense 
the fasb plans to start deliberating the key issues on this subject at future public meetings with a view to issuing an exposure draft in that could become effective in recent developments on february   the united states patent and trademark office issued us a patent for our method of playing a group participation game 
this is our third patent for this game family 
the patents apply to lottery  casino  horse and dog racing and jai alai games that have an optional bonus wager as a feature of the game

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
we consider the fair value of all financial instruments to be not materially different from their carrying value at year end 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
in the third quarter of  we completed the offering and used approximately million of the net proceeds to redeem a portion of our senior subordinated notes 
in the fourth quarter of we replaced our senior secured credit facility with the facility 
in the fourth quarter of we amended and restated our senior credit facility  repaying the term b loan with a portion of the proceeds of a million term c loan due  and increasing the revolving credit facility to million

these instruments  which had a notional value of million canadian dollars at december   have been designated as cash flow hedges 
for the year ended december   we recorded a debit to other comprehensive income loss of million for the change in the fair value of these foreign exchange instruments 
the following table provides notional amounts and exchange rate information about our canadian currency hedge derivative financial instruments 
we do not hold any market risk instruments for trading purposes 
notional amount by expected maturity canadian currency hedge december  there after total fair value dollars in thousands canadian currency hedge notional us amount   exchange rate we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  germany  netherlands  france  austria and chile 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments 
translation gains and losses historically have not been material 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii utilizing borrowings denominated in foreign currency  and iii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
we believe that a adverse change in currency exchange rates would not have a significant adverse effect on our net earnings or cash flows 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit ratings 
this investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks
