concurrent with this transaction  the stfc pooled companies received cash of million and fixed maturities totaling million  which related to the additional net insurance liabilities assumed by the stfc pooled companies on july  the business of the former meridian mutual includes both standard and nonstandard personal lines and standard commercial lines 
the principal lines of business include standard personal and commercial automobile  nonstandard personal automobile  homeowners  commercial multi peril  workers compensation  general liability and fire insurance 
as the former meridian mutual standard and nonstandard business was written and processed through the meridian underwriting and claims system platform  management monitored this business as a separate segment from the state auto standard and nonstandard business 
monitoring of these segments separately was necessary in order to facilitate the integration of the business as these new policies and renewals were converted to the state auto systems platform through which state auto contract forms  pricing  underwriting  and claims philosophies were fully implemented 
with the addition of the former meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement in  the company renamed the two insurance segments that existed prior to to be the state auto standard segment and the state auto nonstandard segment and the former meridian mutual business to be the meridian standard segment and the meridian nonstandard segment 
due to the integration efforts by management  along with the meridian nonstandard segment no longer meeting the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting  beginning with the first quarter of  this segment s business was included in the state auto nonstandard segment 
the and disclosures have been revised to reflect this change 
likewise  the meridian standard business  beginning with the first quarter of  will be included in the state auto standard segment 
effective october   the management agreement was amended to eliminate the management and operations services fee charged by state auto p c to participants to the agreement  including mutual 
as a result of the loss of this income  substantially all of state auto p c s management services income was eliminated at that time 
consequently  beginning with the first quarter  the management and operations services segment is included in the all other category for segment reporting  as the results of this segment no longer meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment 
see reportable segments included herein and footnote regarding the company s operating segments in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the pooling arrangement was amended  effective october   such that the stfc pooled companies aggregate participation was increased from to 
in conjunction with this change in pool participation  the stfc pooled companies received cash of million and fixed maturities totaling million from mutual  which related to the additional net insurance liabilities assumed by the stfc pooled companies on october  for the period october  through december   mutual entered into a stop loss reinsurance arrangement the stop loss with the stfc pooled companies 
under the stop loss  mutual agreed to participate in the pooling arrangement s quarterly underwriting losses and gains in the manner described 
if the pooling arrangement s quarterly statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio the pool loss and lae ratio was between and after the application of all available reinsurance  mutual reinsured the stfc pooled companies of the pooling arrangement s losses in excess of a pool loss and lae ratio of up to 
the stfc pooled companies were responsible for their share of the pooling arrangement s losses over the threshold 
also  mutual had the right to participate in the profits of the pooling arrangement

state auto financial used the proceeds from these debt instruments to contribute additional paid in capital to its insurance subsidiaries as follows million to state auto p c  million to sa national and million to milbank 
milbank used the million additional paid in capital contribution to repay its million surplus note with meridian security 
state auto financial also used these proceeds to repay million of its bank debt and invested the remaining amount in fixed maturity and equity securities 
md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations  continued critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed therein 
losses and loss expenses payable are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what the company expects to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined based on the company s reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months  are case reserved at that time 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes  and certain underwriting expenses relating to the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized ratably over the contract period 
the method followed for computing the acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premium to be earned  losses and loss expenses to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
these amounts are based on estimates  and accordingly  the actual realizable value may vary from the estimated realizable value 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations are long term in nature and require significant management judgment in estimating the factors used to determine these amounts 
management  along with its defined benefit consulting actuary  reviews these factors  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets among other factors 
because these obligations are based upon significant management estimates which could change given available information  the ultimate benefit obligation could be different than the amount estimated 
fixed maturity and equity security investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the net unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
the company regularly monitors its investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary  an assessment that requires significant management judgment 
among the factors management considers are the nature of the investment  severity and length of decline in fair value  events impacting the issuer  and overall market conditions 
when a security in the company s investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  the company adjusts the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income 
as part of the company s management of its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements in connection with the issuance of its million senior notes 
the interest rate swap agreements are the only derivative contracts to which the company is party and are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
this statement requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations  continued at the time a derivative contract is entered into  the company formally documents and designates the derivative as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
the company does not have any derivative contracts hedging foreign currencies or derivative contracts held for speculative purposes 
the company formally assesses  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives used for hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent effective  are recorded in net unrealized gains losses on derivatives  a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
amounts are reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded currently in earnings which are offset to the extent the derivative was affected by changes in fair value of the hedged item

the company s gaap loss and lae ratio defined below reflected a point improvement in from  despite the largest catastrophe loss event in company history occurring in may while all insurance segments reflected an improvement in underwriting results from  the most significant improvement was within the meridian standard segment 
consolidated earned premiums increased million to million in from this increase was primarily the result of premium rate increases across all lines of business see earned premium table below 
the state auto standard segment contributed a increase to consolidated earned premiums in from  while the state auto non standard segment contributed a increase to consolidated earned premiums in the same period 
contributing also to the state auto standard segment s increase was the migration of the meridian standard segment s policies to the state auto systems platform 
these increases in earned premiums were partly offset by two factors declines in the meridian standard segment and an increase in premiums ceded to mutual under the stop loss 
the meridian standard segment declined points in from contributing to this segment s decrease are the following re underwriting the policies migrating on renewal to the state auto systems platform  as well as the non renewal of policies due to significant rate increases and underwriting action taken that management believed were necessary to improve the underwriting performance of the meridian book of business 
the integration also includes the migration of indiana business to affiliate companies outside the pooled companies

overall the composition of the company s book of business did not change significantly from year to year  with the standard auto personal line continuing to be the company s most significant line of business 
in the past months  the company took necessary and in some cases significant rate increases  particularly within the meridian book  in almost all lines of business 
the company expects to be able to implement smaller rate increases in than it had implemented during and this is expected to affect earned premium growth in the years following the implementation of these increases 
in fact  within the last year  the industry has been experiencing a leveling of rate increases and in some cases certain lines have experienced modest rate decreases 
management continues to emphasize that it will not compromise profitability for top line growth and will continue to focus on maintaining its underwriting consistency through all industry cycles 
net investment income increased million to million in from this increase was the result of an increase in invested assets generated by cash flow provided from operations and financing  partly offset by a decline in the investment yield

the auto personal line continues to be the most significant line of business and therefore has the greatest influence on net income 
the homeowners line of business is the company s second largest see earned premium table above 
the loss experience in this line was adversely affected in the last two years by the increased severity of storms  however  due to management s efforts  its gaap loss and lae ratio improved by points in from workers compensation continues to be the company s most volatile line of business due to the risks insured 
workers compensation results have been volatile both for the company and the industry and can have a significant adverse impact on earnings

in addition  all new nonstandard private passenger auto business produced by the former meridian mutual agents is now written through the sa national system platform utilizing a more appropriate rating structure as well as credit scoring as permitted by local law and point of sale underwriting tools 
management continually monitors this segment s underwriting performance  as it is typically a more volatile line of business than the standard segment  paying particular attention to rate adequacy and risk selection in states and agencies with unusually high premium written growth 
kentucky  this segment s largest state of operation  had experienced significant written premium growth over the last year  but with unacceptable underwriting results 
the company has terminated or suspended eleven fast growing  but extremely unprofitable  nonstandard auto oriented agencies in kentucky

the meridian integration is proceeding according to plan

acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the gaap expense ratio  were and for the years and  respectively 
one factor contributing to the point increase is the company cession of earned premium under the stop loss  which was million and million in and  respectively 
these earned premium cessions under the stop loss increased the company s gaap expense ratio by point and less than point for the years and  respectively 
the stop loss agreement terminated december  and was not renewed 
certain significant variable expenses that are tied directly to the company s insurance operation s profitability also contributed to the increased gaap expense ratio 
these are the company s profit sharing plans  the quality performance bonus qpb that covers substantially all employees and the quality performance agreement or contingent commission agreement qpa which is available to substantially all the company s agents

management reviews the qpb plan and the qpa annually to determine the appropriateness of each bonus formula 
any increase in the expense ratio is difficult to accept  but the fact is  that the increase seen this year is largely the result of the company s profitable underwriting operations  as discussed above 
notwithstanding these directly profit driven expense increases  expense control has been and remains one of the critical elements of the company s success  and the importance of this is regularly communicated to all employees 
interest expense increased million to million in from this increase was the result of the additional net million of debt obtained as of december  from december  see discussion included in liquidity and capital resources  partly offset by a decline in the interest rate on the million line of credit with mutual 
other expense  as a percentage of earned premiums  was and for the years and  respectively 
the increase in other expense is primarily attributable to the legal and other related costs incurred by the company related to the tender offer initiated by gregory m 
shepard and his wholly owned company  and other proposals from mr 
shepard that preceded the tender offer 
see part i  item legal proceedings included within this form k 
the effective tax expense rate for the years and were and  respectively 
improvement in the company s underwriting results along with an increase in net realized gains on investments and the gradual shift in increasing the fixed maturity portfolio from tax exempt to taxable securities from contributed to the tax expense rate increase 
management believes the existing level of pre tax earnings is sufficient to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
compared to net income for the company increased by million in contributing to this increase was a point improvement in the company s gaap combined ratio and  as more fully described above  changes made to the company s participation in the pooling arrangement in the second half of additionally  net investment income increased due to the pooling arrangement changes in  which was offset by a decrease in the company s management and operations service income

the addition of the former meridian mutual business and the pooling change increased consolidated earned premiums 
the internal growth of the state auto standard segment s earned premiums increased consolidated earned premiums 
this increase was driven by growth in commercial lines of business due to a combination of rate changes as well as increased policy counts 
personal lines of business continued to experience sales increases over prior year due to changes in the marketplace that permitted rate increases  as well as the expansion of the new personal lines sales specialist position that contributed to increased policy counts 
the internal growth of the state auto nonstandard segment earned premiums increased consolidated earned premiums due to a combination of rate changes and increased policy counts 
md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the internal decline of the meridian standard and nonstandard segments decreased consolidated earned premiums 
this decrease was expected  given the corrective actions taken by management in both these segments  which actions included appropriate and necessary rate increases in almost every line of business 
additionally  one of the more significant actions taken within the meridian standard segment was the discontinuance in late of the group advantage r program which had generated substantial underwriting losses for meridian mutual 
the last group advantage r policy on the books terminated january regarding the meridian nonstandard segment  in addition to taking significant corrective rate action  beginning in late  the company implemented an integration plan to write all new nonstandard auto business produced by the former meridian mutual agents through the state auto nonstandard segment  specifically through national on the national system platform utilizing a more appropriate rating structure as well as credit scoring as permitted by local law and point of sale underwriting tools 
the order of integration had been prioritized such that the states with the most need for profit improvement migrated to national first 
all meridian nonstandard auto new business is now being written through the state auto nonstandard segment 
the business that remains within the meridian nonstandard segment is expected to decrease given this segment s historically low retention rate as well as the company s continuing to take appropriate rate increases

consequently  beginning with the first quarter  the meridian nonstandard auto business was included in the state auto nonstandard segment category 
net investment income increased by million in contributing to the increase over the previous year was an increase in invested assets due to a transfer of million in cash and fixed maturity securities from mutual to the pooled subsidiaries in the second half of this transfer was made in conjunction with the changes made to the pooled subsidiaries participation in the pooling arrangement  as more fully described above 
total cost of invested assets at december  and  was  million and  million  respectively

see further discussion regarding investments at the liquidity and capital resources  investments and market risk sections  included herein

the service fee under the management agreement paid by mutual in was million 
consolidated losses and loss adjustment expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the gaap loss and lae ratio  were and for the years and  respectively 
comparison of the overall results of with those of was affected by the addition of the former meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement 
since the former meridian mutual business was added to the pooling arrangement effective july   it negatively impacted the loss results of the company only in the second half of however  in the results of the former meridian mutual business were included in and negatively impacted the results of the pooling arrangement for the entire year 
comparison of the overall results of with those of is also affected by the reserve strengthening that occurred during the second half of with respect to the meridian segments 
while the meridian standard business continues to produce loss results poorer than the state auto book of business see table of gaap loss and lae ratios operating segments below  management believes there has been improvement in the performance of the meridian segments due to the continuing efforts to improve pricing and risk selection applicable to these segments during during the quarters ended september  and june   the pooled companies produced a pool loss and lae ratio under the stop loss described above that exceeded the threshold  thereby recovering from mutual million and million in losses  respectively total of million for the year ended december  
in the quarters ended december  and march   the pooled companies pool loss and lae ratio was less than  but more than  thereby ceding to mutual  under the stop loss million and million in earned premiums  respectively total of million for the year ended december  
the cession activity through the stop loss had the effect of lowering the gaap loss and lae ratio by and points in and  respectively 
the year was the worst catastrophe year in the history of the company on a dollar loss basis and third worst in terms of gaap loss and lae ratio points 
during the second quarter of  a series of tornadoes and hailstorms went through several of the company s operating states  including an f tornado in la plata  maryland 
this storm was the largest single catastrophe event for the company in  accounting for gaap loss and lae ratio points 
overall  catastrophe losses in were gaap loss and lae ratio points higher than in md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued for discussion purposes  the following table provides comparative gaap loss and lae ratios for the company s insurance operating segments for the and periods  respectively  except for the meridian segments for  which is for the six month period ended december  gaap loss and lae ratio state auto standard segment state auto nonstandard segment meridian standard segment total gaap loss and lae ratio the state auto standard segment gaap loss and lae ratio increased in to from in catastrophe losses represented points of this segment s loss results for compared to points for with the significant increase in new business policy count came an increase in claim submissions 
while general inflation has been relatively modest for the past several years  price inflation on goods and services for which insurance pays  such as medical care and repairs to automobiles and buildings  exceeded the rate of overall inflation and adversely impacted the gaap loss and lae ratio 
the company has reacted to this inflationary trend by filing more aggressive  cost based  rate increases 
also contributing to the current year deterioration in the gaap loss and lae ratio were restrictions on the use of credit scoring in some states where the company does business 
to the extent these limitations result in higher loss ratios  the actuarial rate indications will increase resulting in larger rate increases being sought 
the company is also reviewing its credit scoring models to ensure that the premium rate derived from the model continues to accurately reflect the loss experience associated with each particular credit score range 
representing approximately of this segment s business  personal automobile has over the last five years yielded loss results better than industry average  and in fact  has produced combined ratios of less than 
while the current year results are expected again to better industry average  this line of business did experience deterioration in its current year loss ratio  specifically within the auto liability and no fault lines  which management believes is due at least in part to increasing rates of inflation applicable to the health care sector of the us economy and an increased volume of new business  as noted above 
adverse loss results on workers compensation  commercial multi peril and other liability lines of business  which collectively represents approximately of this segment s business  also contributed to the current year loss result increase 
the company is taking substantial and necessary rate increases in rate per exposure across these lines of business 
workers compensation continues to be one of the most volatile lines that the company provides  and for this reason the company has always maintained a particularly conservative posture on pricing in this line 
the state auto nonstandard segment  which now includes the former meridian nonstandard segment  gaap loss and lae ratio improved in to from in this segment was significantly impacted by the former meridian nonstandard segment case reserve strengthening that occurred during the second half of also largely contributing to the current year loss results improvement were the substantial policy rate increases the company implemented in and in the former meridian nonstandard segment 
this segment experienced more volatility in  especially in those states experiencing substantial premium growth due to policy count increases 
as described above  contributing to this growth has been the addition of national s product to agents who wrote the former meridian mutual s nonstandard auto business 
while nonstandard automobile tends to be a more volatile line of business than standard automobile  management continually monitors this segment s premium rate adequacy 
management has been paying particular attention to the adequacy of these rates in these growth states  as well as risks written in certain agencies  and is reacting accordingly by increasing rates and working with those agencies regarding risk selection 
the meridian standard segment gaap loss and lae ratio for was compared to for the six month period ended december  comparison of the overall results of with those of is affected by the reserve strengthening that occurred during the second half of within this segment 
catastrophe losses represent approximately points of this segment s loss results for both the and periods 
while the meridian standard business continues to produce loss results worse than the state auto book of business  management believes there has been improvement in this segment due to the necessary and continued efforts that began in  eg seeking adequate cost based rates  re underwriting commercial renewals to be certain that risks written are within the state auto underwriting guidelines and discontinuing the group advantage r program

due to the integration efforts by management  along with this segment no longer meeting the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting within the meridian nonstandard business  beginning with the first quarter of  the meridian nonstandard business was included in the state auto nonstandard segment 
the and disclosures have been revised to reflect this change 
likewise  the meridian standard business  beginning with the first quarter of  will be included in the state auto standard segment

the improved loss experience in in these segments reflects the company s continual emphasis on strict underwriting  which includes taking necessary and appropriate rate increases 
the decrease in the company s profit within the state auto standard insurance segment is primarily due to an increase in this segment s loss experience as discussed at compared to in results of operations 
for the state auto nonstandard insurance segment in  increased earned premium growth  as well as an increase in the net investment income  despite deterioration in its loss results  contributed positively to this segment s profit 
as discussed above  management continually monitors these segments premium rate adequacy and seeks adequate cost based rates 
the company s profit within the meridian standard insurance segment is due to an improvement in this segment s current year loss experience as discussed at compared to in results of operations 
the improved loss experience in in this segment is evidence of the company s successful integration efforts that began in to obtain adequate cost based rates  re underwrite the business within state auto underwriting guidelines and terminate unprofitable programs

this segment s revenue is based on the average fair value of the portfolio of the companies managed 
during these years  the investment management segment profit increased as managed invested assets increased 
the increase in segment profit of the all other category is due to an increase in the state auto p c management fee earned from management agreements that are described at overview 
the management fee increased because of the increase in direct written premiums collected under the midwest management agreement and the increase of allocable employee expenses under the migi management agreement 
beginning with the first quarter of  the former management and operations services segment is now included in the all other category for segment reporting as the results of this segment no longer meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment 
all other segment profits  including management and operations services  decreased in and the termination of the service fee under the management agreement was due to the resolution of the disagreement between the company and ohio department of insurance regarding the service fee paid by mutual to the company in see discussion at significant transactions and compared to in results of operations

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability of the company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for both long and short term cash obligations as they come due 
the company s significant sources of cash are premiums  investment income  sales of investments and the maturity of fixed maturity investments 
the company continually monitors its investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
overall net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in is attributable to improved underwriting cash flow  partly offset by an increase in cash paid on estimated federal income taxes and a cash contribution to the companies defined benefit pension plan the plan see discussion below 
the increase in is largely attributable to the prior year changes to the pooled subsidiaries participation in the pooling arrangement 
in the second half of  the pooled subsidiaries received cash of million and fixed maturities of million from mutual as a result of adding the meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement and changing the pooling participation percentage of the pooled subsidiaries from to 
over the last three years  operating cash flows have been sufficient to meet the operating needs of the company while providing increased opportunities for investment 
during  as permitted by irs regulations  the company contributed million in cash to the company s plan on behalf of its employees 
this is the first year since that management has been permitted under applicable rules to make a tax deductible contribution to the plan 
during the years when the company was permitted to make plan contributions  it was the practice of management to contribute the maximum possible as permitted under irs regulations 
this historic practice faired well for the company in the past several years  as many companies with defined benefit plans experienced additional minimum liability recognition 
in it is expected the company will be impacted for the first time in years by a net periodic cost within the plan of approximately million 
while management acknowledges that the net periodic benefit the company recognized in recent years has not been at the levels it experienced in the late s through  it has not impacted the profitability of the company 
as the company continues to be permitted to make contributions  it is management s intent to make the maximum contribution to the plan for the benefit of its employees 
for  it is estimated that the maximum plan contribution will again be approximately million 
total net cash used in investing activities was million during  million during and million in the cash used in investing activities reflects the increase in cash flow provided by improved operating activities and the increase in cash flow provided by financing activities discussed below 
the and years investing activity was reflective of the cash flow generated from operations discussed above

the national association of insurance commissioners naic utilizes a collection of analytical tools designed to assist state insurance departments with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
one such set of analytical tools is key financial ratios that have come to be known in the insurance industry as the iris ratios 
iris ratios are derived from financial statements prepared on a statutory accounting basis  which are accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department with regulatory authority over the company s insurance subsidiaries 
a defined range of results for each ratio has been established by the naic for solvency monitoring 
while management utilizes each of these iris ratios in monitoring its operating performance on a statutory accounting basis  the net written premium to statutory surplus ratio the leverage ratio is monitored to ensure that each of the company s insurance subsidiaries continues to operate within the defined range of to the higher the leverage ratio  the more risk a company bears in relation to statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
in considering this range  management also considers the distribution of net premiums between property and liability lines of business 
a company with a larger portion of net premiums from liability lines should generally maintain a lower leverage ratio 
in the case of sa national and mid plains  both nonstandard auto insurers that write lines of business that are generally short tail in nature and with generally lower amounts of coverage applicable  there is relatively less loss exposure to the premium than is generally the case with other lines of business that are written for higher limits and for which losses develop over long periods of time  such as workers compensation or other liability 
in sum  a higher premium to surplus ratio with a non standard auto insurer is not necessarily indicative of dangerous financial conditions as might be the case with another type insurer 
md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company magagement s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the statutory leverage ratios for the company at december  and are as follows december statutory leverage ratios to state auto p c milbank farmers and subsidiary mid plains sa ohio sa national weighted average the company uses the statutory leverage ratio as there is no comparable gaap measure 
this ratio measures the company s statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
these improvements are due to a combination of the capital contributions made by state auto financial state auto p c million and sa national million from proceeds of the debt securities issued in  improvement in the underwriting operations for the year of each company  as well as effective january   the reserving process for statutory reporting began anticipating salvage and subrogation recoverable for each company 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the reserving process has historically anticipated salvage and subrogation recoverable 
management believes these leverage ratios at december  indicate the financial strength of the company and its position to support future premium growth 
on march   the board of directors of state auto financial declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share  payable on march   to shareholders of record on march  this is the st consecutive cash dividend declared by state auto financial s board since state auto financial had its initial public offering of common stock on june  state auto financial has increased cash dividends to shareholders for twelve consecutive years 
the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to state auto financial during by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval under current law is limited to million 
the company is required to notify the insurance subsidiaries respective state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all such dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary commissioner of each insurer subsidiary has the authority to limit a dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations

state auto financial is obligated to repay spc which would repay the lenders by redeeming the preferred shares over a five year period 
in the event of a default by state auto financial  the obligation to repay spc has been secured by a put agreement among state auto financial  mutual and the lenders  under which mutual would be obligated to either purchase the preferred shares from the spc or repay the spc for the loan s outstanding

as indicated in the table above  the fixed maturity portfolio is of high quality with all holdings in either government obligations  municipal  or corporate obligations 
the company does not intend to change its investment policy on the quality of its fixed maturity investments 
investments in equity securities are selected based on their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
additional information regarding the composition of investments  along with maturity schedules regarding investments in fixed maturities at december   is presented in tabular form above 
the company s primary market risk exposures are to changes in market prices for equity securities and changes in interest rates and credit ratings for fixed maturity securities 
related to the company s investment portfolio  the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk nor does it rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
to provide the company greater flexibility in order to manage its market risk exposures  the company categorizes its fixed maturities as available for sale 
also  the company does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the company s total investments at fair value grew approximately during to  million at december  from  million at december  this growth was generated primarily from cash flow provided by operations and financing  and an increase in the unrealized gains on equity securities partly offset by a decrease in the unrealized gain on fixed maturity securities

based upon the notes payable cost at december   including the effect of the hedge  the company has million notes payable with variable interest and million notes payable with interest fixed at  which equates to approximately variable interest debt and fixed interest debt 
the company s decision to obtain fixed versus variable interest rate debt is influenced primarily by the following factors a current market interest rates b anticipated future market interest rates c availability of fixed versus variable interest instruments and d its currently existing notes payable fixed and variable interest rate position 
as noted above  the company s notes payable mature staggered over the next years due million in  million in and million in losses and loss expenses payable the company s management conducts periodic reviews of loss development reports and makes judgments in determining the reserves for ultimate losses and loss expenses payable 
several factors are considered by management in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  late reported claims  entry errors  and other reasonableness tests 
management s best estimate mbe for sa national  mid plains and the stfc pooled companies share of the pooled companies loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve loss and alae reserve at december   is million compared with an actuarial point estimate of million that is within a projected range of million to million 
the actuarial point estimate and mbe are not materially different 
these values presented are on a direct basis  gross of salvage and subrogation recoverable  and before reinsurance  except for the stfc pooled companies participation in the inter company pooling arrangement 
therefore these values cannot be compared to other loss and loss md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company magagement s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued expenses payable tables included elsewhere within the company s form k 
ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the reserve projections  while the point estimates establish a mean  or expected value for the ultimate reserve 
the mbe of loss reserves considers the actuary s point estimate  or expected value  to be a reasonable and appropriate position within the range 
the following table provides a reconciliation of mbe of the company s direct loss and alae reserve to the company s net loss and loss expenses payable at december  the stfc pooled companies net additional share of transactions assumed from mutual through the pooling arrangement for the year has been reflected in the table below as assumed by stfc pooled companies for the year and at december  direct loss and alae reserve in thousands stfc pooled companies  national and mid plains  assumed by stfc pooled companies  total direct loss and alae reserve  direct unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae stfc pooled companies  national and mid plains  assumed by stfc pooled companies  total direct ulae  direct salvage and subrogation recoverable stfc pooled companies  national and mid plains  assumed by stfc pooled companies  total direct salvage and subrogation recoverable  reinsurance recoverable  assumed reinsurance  reinsurance assumed by stfc pooled companies  total losses and loss expenses payable  net of reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses payable of   alae are those costs that can be related to a specific claim  which may include attorney fees  external claims adjusters  and investigation costs  among others 
ulae are those costs incurred in settling claims  such as in house processing costs  for which no identification can be made to specific claims 
alae and ulae comprise the loss expense portion of the total loss and loss expenses payable 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience being different from historical data and trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
in the preceding paragraphs the company has offered a description of certain factors management considers in estimating the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses 
with respect to the auto line of business  which represents almost half of the company s total reserves  perhaps the most significant external variable is legal developments 
as discussed in impact of significant external factors below  court decisions have a significant impact on the property and casualty insurance industry 
some of these decisions have a more prospective effect as  for example  when contract provisions relating to third party coverages are construed in ways not anticipated by the company 
other court decisions may have more of a retroactive effect which may be seen more clearly in the auto insurance line 
auto insurance tends to be a line of business more regulated by statutes  consequently  the courts tend to have more of an opportunity to construe and apply those statutes to existing contracts 
uninsured motorists and underinsured motorists collectively um are statutory coverages in almost every state where the company does business 
when courts of appeal construe um statutes adversely to the company and the industry  the effect of that decision is typically retroactive  because  legally speaking  when the court interprets a statute it is as though the statute was always construed in the manner that the court determined 
this retroactive effect is exacerbated in um cases and other first party coverage cases because the statute of limitations applicable to um claims and other first party coverages can be as long as years 
claims that had been closed or not even presented  going md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company magagement s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued back as long as fifteen years  can be re born by an adverse court decision 
the company considers the impact of adverse court decisions of which it has become aware when it sets ultimate loss and lae reserves for auto insurance as well as other lines to the extent those lines may be retroactively affected by such matters 
the effect of court decisions is also apparent in the commercial lines of coverages such as commercial multi peril and other liability and products liability 
courts can expand coverage or void exclusions which can increase the company s exposure to claims 
some of these third party claims may still be brought within the statute of limitations applicable to such third party claims and expose the company to some retroactive liabilities 
these liabilities are sought to be addressed by the ultimate loss and lae reserve that is the company s estimate of loss and loss expenses payable 
it is not feasible to quantify the impact of judicial decisions by the courts that may have retroactive effect because the company cannot foresee  among the range of issues that are litigated every day in courts in each state in which the company does business  which cases will be decided adversely and how such decisions will actually apply to the company

with this increased growth  the company experienced more loss activity in which resulted in commensurate reserve growth throughout the current year development of the prior years ultimate liability does not reflect any changes in the company s fundamental claims reserving practices 
a tabular presentation of the current year million development broken down by accident year is shown below derived from the company s and  year loss development tables  as presented in the reserves section of the company s form k  narrative description of business section

this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  this statement requires more prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of this statement and will adopt a transition method at the time when the fasb issues final guidance that is required to be adopted 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of certain entities considered to be variable interest entities vies 
an entity is considered to be md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued a vie when it has equity investors who lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest  or its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
consolidation of a vie by an investor is required when it is determined that the investor will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
as a result of the company adopting fin  effective july   the financial operations of stfc capital trust i  the company s delaware business trust subsidiary see liquidity and capital resource above  are no longer consolidated within the accompanying financial statements of the company 
the net impact of the adoption of fin  effective july   was a reclassification adjustment to eliminate the capital trust s capital securities of million from notes payable and include state auto financial s investment of  in the common securities of capital trust in other invested assets and include million principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated debt securities issued to the capital trust in notes payable

 accounting for certain financial instruments with the characteristics of both liabilities and equity  effective for reporting periods after july  this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the company adopted this statement effective july  with no significant impact to the consolidated financial statements 
impact of significant external factors inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
general inflation  as measured by the cpi  has been relatively modest over the last several years  however  price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims has been steadily increasing 
in particular  repair costs for homes  autos  and commercial buildings  and medical care costs  have risen disproportionately over the last few years 
the company continues to adjust its pricing projections as loss cost trends change in order to ensure premiums keep pace with inflation in all lines of business 
the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses 
the company is also affected by court decisions 
premium rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit 
these rates contemplate a certain level of risk 
the courts may modify  in a number of ways  the level of risk which insurers had expected to assume including eliminating exclusions  multiplying limits of coverage  creating rights for policyholders not intended to be included in the contract and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed 
courts have also undone legal reforms passed by legislatures  which reforms were intended to reduce a litigant s rights of action or amounts recoverable and so reduce the costs borne by the insurance mechanism 
these court decisions can adversely affect an insurer s profitability 
they also create pressure on rates charged for coverages adversely affected and this can cause a legislative response resulting in rate suppression that can adversely affect an insurer 
the company may also be adversely affected by regulatory actions on matters within the jurisdiction of the various insurance departments where the company does business or has entities domiciled 
after credit scoring  the industry s use of which has been limited to varying extents by certain states laws  the next most predictive underwriting report available to insurers is previous loss information 
third party vendors obtain loss information from insurers based on the insured  the vehicle and or the property location 
as insurers write new business the database is accessed to analyze any loss experience of the insured  vehicle and or property location 
many times insurer s premium rates will be adjusted to reflect the loss experience accessed from these databases 
in some cases the overall acceptability of the insured s application in the standard market may be determined by these reports 
during and  use of this loss information database product by the insurance industry as a predictive underwriting tool has been challenged by several west coast states and most recently in a few of the company s states of operation 
while it is too soon to determine states reaction to the utilization of these database systems  any restrictive regulation of the full use of these md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued underwriting reports could have an adverse impact on the company as it has utilized these database systems for several years as an underwriting tool 
since such regulation is applicable to all companies writing business which utilize these reports  the company does not expect to suffer a competitive disadvantage 
the impact of sarbanes oxley act of is continuing to be felt  as the securities and exchange commission sec implements regulatory changes to meet the obligations imposed on it by congress 
certain deadlines have been extended by the sec which may mitigate the cost of compliance to a limited extent 
in addition to complying with the sec and congressional mandates  state auto financial also has to comply with new listing standards of the national association of securities dealers nasd recently approved by the sec  which will contribute to an increase in expenses 
the terrorism risk insurance act of the terrorism act established a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest 
in order for a loss to be covered under the terrorism act  it must be the result of an event that is certified as an act of terrorism by the us secretary of treasury subject losses 
in the case of a war declared by congress  only workers compensation losses are covered by the terrorism act 
the terrorism insurance program the program generally requires that all commercial property casualty insurers licensed in the us participate in the program 
the amount of compensation paid to participating insurers under the program is of subject losses  after an insurer deductible  subject to an annual cap that limits the amount of subject losses to billion aggregate per program year 
the company s deductible under this federal program is approximately million for  subject to final rules to be established by the us treasury 
under the terrorism act  commercial property and casualty insurers must offer their commercial policyholders coverage against certified acts of terrorism  but the policyholders may choose to reject this coverage 
if the policyholder rejects coverage for certified acts of terrorism  the company intends  subject to the approval of the state regulators  to cover only such acts of terrorism that are not certified acts under the terrorism act and that do not arise out of nuclear  biological or chemical agents 
trends and uncertainties company management has identified certain trends and uncertainties that have the potential to significantly affect the company and the property and casualty insurance industry increasing price competition declining investment rate of return volatile investment market increasing frequency and severity of storm losses  including catastrophes increasing health care cost increasing consolidation of the property and casualty insurance industry changing product distribution channels new and changing insurance risks such as asbestos  mold  silica and acts of terrorism business continuity planning company management considers these trends and uncertainties  and others  in the management of the company operations 
increasing price competition can have the effect of decreasing the rate of growth of earned premiums  if not decreasing earned premiums  as the company s underwriting philosophy does not permit risk selection at a price below which management believes is adequate 
the declining investment rate of return can decrease the rate of growth of  investment income as well as decrease  investment income and net income  as the company invests for an adequate return with a focus on principal preservation risk 
the volatile investment market and related investment valuation can affect the insurers statutory surplus as the fair value of investments fluctuate 
the increasing frequency and severity of storm losses and increasing health care costs can have the effect of increasing losses and decreasing operating profits 
management considers these trends and uncertainties in the writing and pricing of policies 
because of the company s growth and planned greater geographic dispersion of risk  the loss ratio point impact of recent catastrophes has not been as severe as catastrophe losses several years ago that had fewer loss dollars associated with them 
there continues to be consolidation within the property and casualty insurance industry which can increase competition by creating insurance companies with more resources and capital 
as demonstrated over the years  the company has acquired and successfully integrated insurance companies in the past and considers acquisition opportunities as they arise 
the company believes acquisitions md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued will be an important part of its growth strategies 
company management also monitors the changing product distribution channels  along with its changing relationships with agencies and consolidation occurring within the agency distribution system itself 
the company remains committed to cultivating strong relationships with its agencies and to selling insurance products through the independent agency system 
the company considers the expanding scope of insurance risks  such as asbestos  mold  silica and acts of terrorism  in its pricing  writing of policies and drafting policy forms 
the company established a business continuity plan to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed 
management will continue to assess the business continuity plan to ensure it meets the company s changing core business operations needs 
overall  the company considers one of its key strengths to be its core values which are to i fairly price and ethically sell useful insurance products  ii treat every transaction with absolute honesty and integrity  iii extend dignity and respect to everyone  iv encourage innovation  and v fully utilize every person s talents 
these core values  which reflect the tone at the top  serve the interests of all the company s constituencies 
as discussed above  there was particular emphasis throughout  and on improving the former meridian mutual book of business 
the company believes its underwriting and pricing discipline  as well as its commitment to delivering its products as effectively and efficiently as possible  have been key factors in the company s underwriting results over the last several years 
the company remains active in the personal and commercial markets  developing new products to enhance its product portfolio  appointing new agents in its operating territories  and refining its pricing levels for the markets and lines of business the company believes offer the most profit potential 
forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results statements contained in this form k or any other reports or documents prepared by the company or made by management may be forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected 
forward looking statements may be identified  preceded by  followed by  or otherwise include  without limitation  words such as plans  believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  or similar expressions 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual financial performance 
the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for losses and loss expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent estimates  generally using actuarial projection techniques at a given accounting date 
the company refines reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
the company records adjustments to reserves in the results of operations for the periods in which the estimates are changed 
because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be adequate 
if the company concludes that estimates are incorrect and reserves are inadequate  the company is obligated to increase its reserves 
an increase in reserves results in an increase in losses and a reduction in the company s net income for the period in which the deficiency in reserves is identified 
accordingly  an increase in reserves could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
the company s insurance operations expose it to claims arising out of catastrophic events 
the company has experienced  and will in the future experience  catastrophe losses that may cause substantial volatility in the company s financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce the company s profitability or harm the company s financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  hailstorms  windstorms  earthquakes  explosions  severe winter weather  and fires  none of which are within the company s control 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
the geographic distribution of the company s business subjects it to catastrophe exposure from hailstorms and earthquakes in the midwest as well as catastrophe exposure from hurricanes in florida and the gulf coast  southern coastal states  and mid atlantic regions 
catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed the company s recent historic results 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the company uses reinsurance to help manage its exposure to insurance risks 
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions  both in terms of price and available capacity  which can affect the company s business volume and profitability 
although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the ceded reinsurance  the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
as a result  ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate the company s obligation to pay claims 
the company is subject to credit risk with respect to the company s ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
reinsurance may not be adequate to protect the company against losses and may not be available to the company in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
in addition  the magnitude of losses in the reinsurance industry resulting from catastrophes may adversely affect the financial strength of certain reinsurers  which may result in the company s inability to collect or recover reinsurance 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims 
ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors that they believe are relevant to policyholders 
ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in the company and in its ability to market its products 
a downgrade in the company s financial strength ratings could  among other things  negatively affect the company s ability to sell certain insurance products  the company s relationships with agents  new sales  and the company s ability to compete 
the company markets its insurance products through independent  non exclusive insurance agents  whereas some of the company s competitors sell their insurance products through insurance agents who sell products exclusively for one insurance company 
if the company is unsuccessful in attracting and retaining productive agents to sell the company s insurance products  the company s sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the agents that market and sell the company s products also sell the company s competitors products 
these agents may recommend the company s competitors products over the company s products or may stop selling the company s products altogether 
additionally  the company competes with the company s competitors for productive agents  primarily on the basis of the company s financial position  support services and compensation and product features 
mutual and the company have acquired other insurance companies and it is anticipated that mutual and the company will continue to pursue acquisitions of other insurance companies in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including the following obtaining necessary regulatory approvals of the acquisition may prove to be more difficult than anticipated  integrating the acquired business may prove to be more costly or difficult than anticipated  integrating the acquired business without material disruption to existing operations may prove to be more difficult than anticipated  anticipated cost savings may not be fully realized or not realized within the anticipated time frame or additional or unexpected costs may be incurred  loss results of the company acquired may be worse than expected  and retaining key employees of the acquired business may prove to be more difficult than anticipated 
in addition  other companies in the insurance industry have similar acquisition strategies 
there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the company s operations  that competition for acquisitions will not intensify or that the company will be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions 
in addition  the costs of unsuccessful acquisition efforts may adversely affect the company s financial performance 
the company s operations are subject to changes occurring in the legislative  regulatory and judicial environment 
risks and uncertainties related to the legislative  regulatory  and judicial environment include  but are not limited to  legislative changes at both the state and federal level  state and federal regulatory rulemaking promulgations and adjudications that may affect the company specifically  its affiliates or the industry generally  class action and other litigation involving the company  its affiliates  or the insurance industry generally  and judicial decisions affecting claims  policy coverages and the general costs of doing business 
many of these changes are beyond the company s control 
md a state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad regulatory powers relative to approving intercompany arrangements  such as management  pooling  and investment management agreements  granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating trade practices  licensing agents  approving policy forms  setting reserve requirements  determining the form and content of required statutory financial statements  prescribing the types and amount of investments permitted and requiring minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus 
in addition  although premium rate regulation varies among states and lines of insurance  such regulations generally require approval of the regulatory authority prior to any changes in rates 
furthermore  all of the states in which the state auto group transacts business have enacted laws which restrict these companies underwriting discretion 
examples of these laws include restrictions on agency terminations and laws requiring companies to accept any applicant for automobile insurance and laws regulating underwriting tools 
these laws may adversely affect the ability of the insurers in the state auto group to earn a profit on their underwriting operations 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
while prices have generally increased in some lines  the rate of increase has moderated and competition continues to be intense 
the company competes with numerous insurance companies  many of which are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial resources 
the company competes through underwriting criteria  appropriate pricing  and quality service to the policyholder and the agent and through a fully developed agency relations program
