item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some information contained in the management s discussion and analysis is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties 
the results achieved this year are not necessarily an indication of future prospects for the company 
actual results in future years may differ materially 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  fluctuations in the volume and timing of product orders  changes in demand for the company s products  changes in technology  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace  availability of raw materials  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
overview the company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications 
the overall business is comprised of three reportable segments surfactants surfactants  which accounted for percent of total net sales  are a principal ingredient in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents  shampoos  lotions  fabric softeners  toothpastes and cosmetics 
other applications include lubricating ingredients and emulsifiers for agricultural products  and plastics and composites 
surfactants are manufactured at six north american sites four in the us and one each in mexico and canada  three european sites and one south american site 
polymers polymers  which accounted for percent of total net sales  includes three primary product lines phthalic anhydride pa  polyurethane polyols and polyurethane systems 
pa is used in polyester alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive  boating and other consumer products 
polyurethane polyols are used in the manufacture of laminate board for the construction industry and are also sold to the appliance  coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 
polyurethane systems provide thermal insulation and are sold to the construction  industrial and appliance markets 
all polymer product lines are manufactured at one us site  and polyurethane polyols are also manufactured in a new facility in europe germany 
specialty products specialty products  which accounted for three percent of total net sales  include flavors  emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries 
specialty products are manufactured at one us site 
because of the diverse markets it serves  the company has numerous competitors 
the company generally competes on price  product performance and the ability to meet specific needs of customers 
in some instances  particularly for the surfactants segment  the company competes with large divisions of its customers 
the impact of such competition  particularly when combined with excess capacity in the chemical industry  was felt in late and all of as the company lost sales volume in its surfactants business when two major customers shifted business from the company into the customers own internal production facilities 

table of contents the company relies heavily on processing equipment to manufacture its products 
in that sense  the company is capital intensive  and therefore  its manufacturing costs are relatively fixed in nature 
as a result  gross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales is susceptible to declines when volume decreases 
such cost behavior played an important role in the company s decreased profitability in a number of the company s key raw materials are commodities  principally natural gas used to power the company s plants and petroleum based and other feedstocks  whose prices fluctuate due to weather  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
during  raw material costs increased due to political uncertainty in the middle east and to tight supplies resulting from greater material consumption by china and other parts of asia 
this trend has continued into early and is likely to do so for the near future 
increased raw material costs are passed on to customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements with the company which allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent raw material costs from being passed on to customers  particularly in periods when there is excess industry capacity 
accordingly  some product lines or market segments may take time to recover raw material cost increases 
the company s operating expenses  which include marketing  administrative and research and development expenses  are predisposed to period to period fluctuations 
such fluctuations are principally caused by the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans  obligations associated with environmental remediation liabilities and the impact on translation of fluctuations in foreign currencies 
the company operates in a setting of extensive local  state and federal regulations concerning the environment 
the company has been named as a potentially responsible party  to perform environmental remediation at the company s expense  at a number of geographic sites 
the company believes it has adequate reserves for all known environmental sites  but an adverse determination could result in a significant negative effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in  fluctuations related to deferred compensation plans and environmental matters resulted in a million increase in administrative expenses versus for further discussions of these matters  see the environmental and legal matters and critical accounting policies sections of this management discussion and analysis 
as reflected in the percent year to year decline in net income  was an extremely challenging year for the company 
replacing the aforementioned lost surfactants business has progressed slower than anticipated 
as a result  the company implemented a strategy to reduce costs and streamline operations by eliminating discretionary spending  reducing its us work force by five percent and freezing salaries company wide beginning in although the company will continue to seek ways to contain costs  the highest priority is to realize opportunities that have been targeted for growth 
surfactants opportunities include growing the company s global position in fabric softener markets and developing a greater presence in the soap bar market 
in june  the company began producing polyurethane polyols at its new german manufacturing facility  ton capacity  which positions the company to take further advantage of an increasing european demand for polyester polyol products 
on february   the company entered into an agreement with a partner to build a polyol plant outside nanjing  china 
the plant would require at least months to build  so no earnings contributions are expected from this joint venture in however  longer term  the company believes there is potential for serving asia s construction market 

table of contents results of operations compared with summary net income for fell million  or percent  to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for below is a summary discussion of the factors leading to the year to year drop in profitability 
a more detailed discussion of segment operating performance follows the summary 
consolidated net sales increased million  or five percent  to million in from million in the effects of foreign currency translation contributed million  or three percent  of the increase in consolidated net sales 
the remaining two percent increase in consolidated net sales was attributable primarily to sales price increases  as consolidated volumes were essentially flat with last year 
all three segments reported increases in net sales from year to year 
surfactants segment sales were up million  or three percent  due to favorable foreign currency translation and higher sales prices  as higher european volumes were offset by lower us domestic  canada and south american sales volume 
net sales for the polymers segment increased million  or percent  due primarily to higher selling prices that reflected rising raw material costs and higher sales volume 
the specialty products segment reported nearly flat year to year net sales 
despite the increase in net sales  operating income fell million  or percent  to million in from million in gross profit dropped million  or percent  from year to year  primarily due to lower domestic surfactants sales volume and higher surfactants and polymers raw material costs 
in addition  gross profit was unfavorably impacted by a million charge for impairment losses on specific surfactants equipment 
operating expenses  consisting of marketing  administrative and research and development expenses  increased million  or six percent  to million in from million in the year to year operating expense increase included million of environmental expenses related to remediation requirements at previously and currently owned facilities  a million increase in deferred compensation expense that resulted primarily from the appreciation in value of the mutual fund assets held for the deferred compensation plan  and a fourth quarter charge of million for separation costs associated with a five percent reduction in the company s domestic work force 
for additional details regarding the fluctuations in net sales  gross profit and operating income  see the segment results discussion that follows this overview 
interest expenses increased million  or nine percent  between years due to a higher proportion of fixed rate debt 
the company secured additional fixed rate debt in first half of to lock in low long term rates  although such rates are higher than current short term rates 
income from the company s philippine joint venture decreased to million in from million a year ago 
a change in product mix coupled with lower royalty income accounted for the drop in joint venture profit 

table of contents other  net  which includes foreign currency gains and losses and investment income and expense  increased million between year 
foreign currency exchange gains on european operations debt that is denominated in us dollars accounted for most of the increase 
the gains reflected the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 
the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the lower effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the tax benefit realized on foreign joint venture equity income and federal and state tax credits  which increased as a percentage of consolidated income due to the decline in domestic operating results 
the decrease is also attributable to a greater percentage of consolidated income being generated in foreign countries where the overall effective tax rate is lower 
segment results dollars in thousands surfactants polymers specialty products corporate total for the year ended december  net sales operating income for the year ended december  net sales operating income surfactants surfactants net sales increased million  or three percent  from year to year 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  due particularly to the strengthening euro and british pound sterling against the us dollar 
excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  net sales for foreign operations increased million  or six percent  on sales volume that increased four percent 
domestic net sales dropped million  or two percent  on sales volume that declined five percent 
european operations  most notably the company s uk subsidiary  accounted for the foreign volume gain 
the company s growing share of the uk s sulfonation market as well as new sales resulting from the late acquisition of the pentagon chemicals specialties biocides and specialty surfactants businesses led to the improvement in the uk operations volume 
the decline in domestic sales volume was due principally to the loss of business from two large customers who brought previously outsourced production into internal production facilities 
lost share at some smaller laundry and cleaning products customers  due to competitive situations  also contributed to the drop in volume 
the company had anticipated that growth in its fabric softener products would reduce the impact of the lost business  however  while fabric softener growth has occurred  it has not materialized as rapidly as originally projected 
surfactants operating income fell million  or percent  from to  primarily due to a gross profit decline of million  or percent  to million in 
table of contents from million in essentially all of the gross profit decline represents a domestic gross profit decrease of million  or percent  from year to year due to the previously noted five percent drop in sales volume 
because of the generally fixed nature of the company s manufacturing costs  gross profit is susceptible to significant declines when sales volumes fall as occurred in the company s us business in cost increases for a number of key surfactant raw materials also contributed to the lower domestic gross profit 
in addition to the lower sales volume and higher raw material costs  domestic gross profit was negatively affected by million of asset impairment losses related primarily to equipment located at the company s millsdale joliet  illinois plant that was specifically used for the processing of a product that will no longer be manufactured at that site 
no alternative use could be found for the equipment  which represented a very small portion of the plant s production capacity 
gross profit for foreign operations increased million  or three percent  between years 
excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  foreign gross profit fell million from year to year 
the positive impact of the sales volume increase was more than offset by higher raw material costs  particularly in europe 
operating expenses increased million  or percent  from to excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation  operating expenses declined million 
domestic research and development expense accounted for the decrease  which resulted from lower payroll related expenses and year to year reallocation of resources to the specialty products segment 
polymers polymer net sales increased million  or percent  from year to year 
higher prices  due primarily to passing recent raw material cost increases to customers  a four percent increase in sales volume and million of favorable foreign currency translation on european sales all led to the increase in net sales 
within the polymers segment  polyurethane polyols net sales increased million  or percent  on sales volume that grew percent due primarily to an improved us construction market that led to higher sales volumes to existing customers and from an increased share of the growing european laminate board market 
polyurethane systems net sales improved million  or percent  on sales volume that increased percent due to the acquisition of a major new customer during the year 
pa s net sales were down million  or three percent  on sales volume that declined five percent  as demand from two major customers declined in as a result of a shrinking share of their respective markets 
despite its increased net sales and sales volume  polymers operating income decreased million  or four percent  to million in from million in gross profit was up just million  or one percent  between years 
gross profit for polyurethane systems and pa improved million and million  respectively  while gross profit for polyurethane polyols dropped million 
the aforementioned sales volume increase accounted for the improvement in polyurethane systems gross profit 
pa s gross profit was positively impacted by lower manufacturing costs  particularly utilities and depreciation 
the decrease in polyurethane polyols gross profit was due to higher raw material costs that more than offset the effect of increased sales volume 
second quarter selling price increases were effective in passing on only a portion of the higher costs to customers 
polymer raw material prices are expected to increase further as global demand for ethylene and petroleum based products is high and current supplier inventories are low 
polymer operating expenses increased million  or nine percent  from year to year 
higher expense in europe led to million of the increase 
foreign currency 
table of contents translation accounted million of europe s increase  while the remainder of the change was due to higher administrative and marketing expenses supporting the new german facility 
domestic expense increased million due primarily to higher product development expenses 
specialty products net sales for the year were million  a million increase from the million reported a year ago 
despite the increase in net sales  operating income declined million  or percent  due a lower sales volume of higher margin pharmaceutical products 
higher research expense also contributed to the operating income decline 
corporate expenses corporate expenses  which primarily include corporate administrative and corporate manufacturing expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments  increased million  or six percent  from million in to million in environmental expenses were up million between years due to contractual obligations for shared remediation costs associated with a formerly owned manufacturing site and anticipated remediation expenses for a currently owned facility 
a million increase in deferred compensation expense  arising primarily from the appreciation in value of the mutual fund investments held for the deferred compensation plan  contributed to the corporate expense increase for an explanation regarding the company s deferred compensation plan see the critical accounting policies section of this discussion also factoring into the higher corporate expenses was a fourth quarter charge of million for separation costs associated with a five percent reduction in the company s us work force 
the reduction in force  which was part of a strategy to reduce operating costs and streamline operations  was realized through a process of voluntary and involuntary terminations and through eliminating unfilled open positions 
costs associated with implementation of the company s enterprise resource planning system erp were down million due primarily to the completion of the north american implementation in the fourth quarter of stepan uk s erp implementation was completed in the fourth quarter of  and the erp implementation throughout the rest of europe will occur in a million recovery of settlement costs related to an old legal case also offset the corporate expense increases 
fourth quarter compared with the company reported a fourth quarter net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  compared to fourth quarter net income of million  or per diluted share 
consolidated net sales increased million  or nine percent  to million for the fourth quarter of from million for the fourth quarter of net sales increased for all business segments 
excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  consolidated net sales increased million  or five percent 
despite the net sales increase  the company posted an operating loss of million in the last quarter of compared to operating income of million for the same period of gross profit fell million  or percent  from quarter to quarter 
the surfactants segment accounted for the decline in gross profit  reporting a drop of million  or percent 
surfactants gross profit decline reflected lower domestic sales volume  higher global raw material costs and a fourth quarter asset impairment loss of million 
gross profit for the polymers and specialty products segments increased by 
table of contents million  or percent  and million  or percent  respectively 
operating expenses increased million  or percent  to million in the fourth quarter of from million in the fourth quarter of a million increase in deferred compensation expense related to the appreciation in investment assets held for the deferred compensation plan accounted for a large part of the expense increase 
also contributing to the quarter to quarter operating expense increase were million of severance charges related to the company s fourth quarter reduction in force and approximately million related to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation 
all of the foregoing factors combined with million of lower philippine joint venture income  resulting from a change in sales mix  and million of realized losses on investment sales led to a fourth quarter loss before income taxes of million compared to fourth quarter income before income taxes of million

the fluctuations in operating income and gross profit are discussed further under segment results below 
interest expenses rose million  or three percent  from year to year  due primarily to higher average debt levels 

table of contents philippine joint venture equity income increased to million in from million a year ago 
the rise was due to royalty income and higher equity income generated by higher sales volume 
pre tax income increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the lower effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the effective tax rate on european earnings and a higher us tax benefit realized on export sales

the company also meets short term liquidity requirements through uncommitted domestic bank lines of credit 

table of contents as of december   the company would have been out of compliance with the interest coverage test under its us loan agreements with pre tax earnings as reported 
the company notified its banks and long term lenders of the potential non compliance in a timely manner  in accordance with the terms of all loan agreements 
as of march   the company had obtained amendments  effective as of december   to the interest coverage test for all of its us loan agreements 
as a result  the company was in compliance with all loan agreements  as amended  as of december  the company s foreign subsidiaries maintain bank term loans and short term bank lines of credit in their respective countries to meet working capital requirements as well as to fund capital expenditure programs and acquisitions 
as of december   the company s european subsidiaries had term loans  including current maturities  totaling million and short term debt totaling million  all in local currencies

as of december   the company had million in standby letters of credit for these agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
environmental and legal matters the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million 
these projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which is typically years 
recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at our manufacturing locations were approximately million for and million for while difficult to project  it is not anticipated that these recurring expenses will increase significantly in the future 
the company has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under cercla and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
it is the company s accounting policy to record liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
because reported liabilities are recorded based on estimates  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
after partial remediation payments at certain 
table of contents sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december  the company s reserve was million for legal contingencies and environmental matters compared to million at december  during  non capital expenditures related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in for certain sites  estimates cannot be made of the total costs of compliance or the company s share of such costs  accordingly  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on future results of operations 
in the event of one or more adverse determinations in any annual or interim period  the impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations for those periods could be material 
however  based upon the company s present belief as to its relative involvement at these sites  other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
certain of these matters are discussed in item  legal proceedings  in this report and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company 
see also note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the environmental proceedings related to certain environmental sites 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
deferred compensation the company maintains deferred compensation plans 
these plans allow management to defer receipt of its bonuses and directors to defer receipt of director fees until retirement or departure from the company 
the plans allow for the compensation being deferred to grow or decline based on the results of investment options chosen by the participants 
such options include either a the appreciation depreciation in stepan company common stock or b a limited variety of mutual funds 
ultimately  upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive the cash equivalent value of the investment choices they have made as of the date of plan distribution 
as a result  any appreciation in the value of stepan company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan result is additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the market price of stepan company stock or the value of the mutual funds results in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
it is these market price movements that result in the significant period to period fluctuations that impact the company s consolidated statements of income 

table of contents as of december   the company s deferred compensation liability is approximately million  of which approximately percent represents deferred compensation tied to the performance of stepan company common stock and the remainder is tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of stepan company common stock will result in approximately  of additional compensation expense 
similarly  a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will fluctuate generally in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by buying a portfolio of mutual funds that matches the investment choices made by the plan participants 
when plan participants choose the stepan company common stock option  the company will generally acquire  and put into treasury stock  an equivalent number of stepan company common shares from the open market 
the mutual fund assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
while these market value adjustments affect the income statement due to their impact on the company s ultimate cash liability  there is not an offsetting income statement impact from fluctuation in the asset value  as generally accepted accounting principles require unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities be recorded as a direct adjustment to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
dividends and capital gains received from the mutual funds  as well as realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss under the other  net caption of the consolidated statements of income 
since the stepan company stock is held as treasury stock  no further adjustments are made to equity as a result of market price movements in the stock 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
for example  during  the company recorded million of expense related to estimated liabilities at two sites for which no prior reserves had been established based on new information received  whereas  in  there were no such similar charges 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
the company believes recognition of revenue upon shipment is the appropriate point of revenue recognition as the company has no further performance obligations to the customer other than in connection with customer volume discount programs 
volume discounts due customers are estimated and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and are reported as reductions of revenue in the statements of income 
volume discount programs are specific and unique to each customer and are based on negotiated contract rates 
such contracts are generally annual in nature
