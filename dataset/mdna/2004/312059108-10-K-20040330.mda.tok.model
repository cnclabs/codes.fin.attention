item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking statements in addition to the historical information contained herein  this report contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies  and expectations of bankshares  and are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project may  will or similar expressions 
although we believe our plans  intentions and expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that these plans  intentions  or expectations will be achieved 
our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain  and actual results could differ materially from those contemplated 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  the legislative regulatory climate  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the quality or composition of tfb s loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in our market area and accounting principles  policies and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements in this report  and you should not place undue reliance on such statements  which reflect our position as of the date of this report 
critical accounting policies general 
bankshares financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in our estimates 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable accounting method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the specific allowance  the formula allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for larger balance  non homogeneous loans 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
first  analysis of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  the prospects for support from financial guarantors  and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
additionally  the migration of historical default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  industry and market conditions and trends  and other environmental factors are considered 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the formula allowance is used for estimating the loss on pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  including family mortgage loans  installment loans  other consumer loans  and outstanding loan commitments 
also  the formula allowance is used for the remaining pool of larger balance  non homogeneous loans which were not allocated a specific allowance upon their review 
the formula allowance begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the homogeneous portfolio based upon various statistical analyses 
these include analysis of historical and peer group delinquency and credit loss experience  together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions 
we also consider trends and changes in the volume and term of loans  changes in the credit process and or lending policies and procedures  and an evaluation of overall credit quality 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses 
as a result  even though this history is regularly updated with the most recent loss information  it could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowances 
in addition  an unallocated reserve is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring inherent losses on individual loans or pools of loans 
executive overview this discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding bankshares and tfb and may not contain all the information that is important to the reader 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements 
as such  this discussion should be read carefully in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report 
through merger and consolidation  tfb has become the primary independent community bank in its immediate market area 
it continually seeks to be the primary financial service provider for its market area by providing the right mix of high quality customer service  efficient technological support  value added products  and a strong commitment to the community 
net income of million in was a increase from net income of million 
bankshares and tfb experienced growth across all of its primary operating businesses  with growth in commercial and retail lending  deposit accounts and core deposits  and assets under wms management 
during  tfb modified its loan pricing strategies and expanded its loan product offerings in an effort to increase lending activity without sacrificing the existing credit quality standards 
the result of this was a increase in net loan outstandings in deposits increased from year end to year end  with tfb gaining in market customers who grew dissatisfied with the service and pricing resulting from the consolidation of other local community banks into larger  out of market financial institutions 
assets under management grew by million to million  or  from  with revenue increasing from  to  or  as management focused more people  marketing  and other resources toward its wms business 
net interest income is the largest component of net income  and equals the difference between income generated on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
future trends regarding net interest income are dependent on the absolute level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the amount of lost income from non performing assets  the amount of prepaying loans  the mix and amount of various deposit types  and many other factors  as well as the overall volume of interest earning assets 
these factors are individually difficult to predict  and when taken together  the uncertainty of future trends compounds 
based on management s current projections  net interest income may increase in and beyond as average interest earning assets increase  but this may be offset in part or in whole by a possible contraction in tfb s net interest margin resulting from competitive market conditions 
additionally  tfb s balance sheet is positioned for a stable or rising interest rate environment 
this means that net interest is projected to increase if market interest rates rise  and to decrease if market interest rates fall 
the specific nature of tfb s variability in net interest income due to changes in interest rates  also known as interest rate risk  is to a large degree the result of tfb s deposit base structure 
during  demand deposits  now  and savings deposits averaged   and of total average deposits  respectively  while the more interest rate sensitive time certificates of deposit averaged of total average deposits 
tfb continues to have strong credit quality as evidenced by non performing loans totaling  or of total loans at december   as compared with  or of total loans at december  the provision for loan losses was  for compared with  for the increase in the provision for loan losses from to was largely in response to the growth in new loan originations during  and  to a lesser extent  the continued uncertainty existing in the economic and geopolitical environment 
management continues the expansion of its branch network into southern fauquier county with a new branch scheduled to open in bealeton  virginia during the first half of additionally  tfb looks to add to its branch network in western prince william county 
tfb is looking toward these new retail markets for growth in deposits and wms income 
management also seeks to increase the level of its fee income from deposits and wms through the increase of its market share within its marketplace

certain expenses associated with that misappropriation of cash reduced and earnings by  and  net of tax  respectively 
on december   earnings were reduced by  net of tax benefit  or per diluted share  due to an extraordinary expense associated with the early payoff of the fhlb of atlanta advances 
the restructuring of tfb s balance sheet through the early payoff of the fhlb of atlanta borrowings resulted from the greater than anticipated success of tfb s retail deposit retention campaign 
deposits grew by million  or  from december  to december  the benefit of this restructuring strategy  in addition to increasing tfb s flexibility in its asset liability management process  included the reduction of interest expense during and beyond 
the realized and anticipated reduction in interest expense is projected to more than offset the one time extraordinary expense of the early payoff

loans are charged off when deemed by management to be uncollectable  after taking into consideration such factors as the current financial condition of the customer and the underlying collateral and guarantees 
bankshares adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
this statement has been amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
fasb statement no 
 as amended  requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation is to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
fasb statement no 
 as amended also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that tfb will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  financial condition of the borrower  and the current economic conditions 
a performing loan may be considered impaired if the factors above indicate a need for impairment 
a loan on non accrual status may not be impaired if it is in the process of collection or if the shortfall in payment is insignificant 
a delay of less than days or a shortfall of less than of the required principal and interest payments generally is considered insignificant and would not indicate an impairment situation  if in management s judgment the loan will be paid in full 
loans that meet the regulatory definitions of doubtful or loss generally qualify as impaired loans under fasb statement no 
as is the case for all loans  charge offs for impaired loans occur when the loan or portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectible 
bankshares considers all consumer installment loans and residential mortgage loans to be homogenous loans 
these loans are not subject to individual impairment under fasb statement no 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they have been specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed from income 
interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest income on other non accrual loans is recognized only to the extent of interest payments received 
total loans on the balance sheet are comprised of the following classifications as of december      and loan portfolio in thousands december  loans secured by real estate construction      secured by farmland    family residential      commercial real estate      commercial and industrial loans except those secured by real estate      consumer loans to individuals except those secured by real estate      all other loans      total loans      less unearned discount total loans  net of unearned discount      the following is a schedule of maturities and sensitivities of loans subject to changes in interest rates as of december  maturity schedule of selected loans in thousands year within within after year years years total commercial and industrial loans    construction loans    for maturities over one year floating rate loans   fixed rate loans    the following table sets forth certain information with respect to tfb s non accrual  restructured and past due loans  as well as foreclosed assets  for the periods indicated non performing assets and loans contractually past due in thousands years ended december  nonaccrual loans restructured loans other real estate owned total non performing assets loans past due days accruing interest allowance for loan losses to total loans at period end non performing assets to period end loans and other real estate owned potential problem loans at december   management is not aware of any significant problem loans not included in table 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  credit concentration  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and current economic conditions 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio to determine probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowances relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance remains subject to change 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  recorded as the provision for loan losses on bankshares statements of income  are made monthly to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged off or recovered during a given period and current national and local economic conditions 
at december      and the allowance for loan losses was     and  respectively

the allowance has been allocated according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the following categories of loans at the dates indicated  although the entire allowance balance is available to absorb any actual charge offs that may occur 
during  tfb refined its policies  guidelines  and methods for determining the allowance for loan losses  and allocating the allowance among various loan categories 
greater weight was given to the loss history by loan category  prolonged changes in portfolio delinquency trends by loan category  and changes in economic trends 
as a result  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses in   and may not be comparable to prior periods

the growth in the provision for loan losses from to primarily reflects the same year to year growth in smaller balance  homogeneous loans  including family mortgage loans  installment loans  other consumer loans  and outstanding loan commitments 
there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts  or that increased amounts of provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
non performing loans non performing loans  in most cases  consist of loans that are days or more past due and for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
management evaluates all loans that are days or more past due  as well as borrowers that have suffered financial distress  to determine if they should be placed on non accrual status 
factors considered by management include the net realizable value of collateral  if any  and other resources of the borrower that may be available to satisfy the delinquency 
non performing loans totaled  or of total loans at december   as compared with  or of total loans at december  non performing loans as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses were and at december  and  respectively 
loans that were days past due and accruing interest totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
at december   loans days past due consisted of four loans 
of the   was secured by real estate 
no material loss is anticipated on any of these four loans 
there are no loans  other than those disclosed above as either non performing or impaired  where information known about the borrower has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to repay 
there are no other interest bearing assets that would be subject to disclosure as either non performing or impaired if such interest bearing assets were loans 
at december   no concentration of loans to commercial borrowers engaged in similar activities exceeds of total loans 
the largest industry concentration at december  was approximately of loans to the hospitality industry hotels  motels  inns  etc non interest income compared to total non interest income increased by million from million in to million in non interest income is derived primarily from fee income  which consists primarily of fiduciary and other wms fees  service charges on deposit accounts  and other fee income 
this increase stemmed primarily from the net gain on sale of securities  as well as from revenues related to the continued growth of tfb s deposit base and retail banking activities  the increase of estate fees within tfb s wms  and income generated from the purchase of bank owned life insurance boli 
wms income increased  or from to service charges on deposit accounts increased  or to million for  compared with million for the major factor in the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was the impact of tfb s average demand deposit base increasing from million during to million during other service charges  commissions and fees increased from million in to million primarily due to  of income from the february  purchase of million of boli policies on certain key executives  as well as increased income from visa check card fees 
gains on securities  available for sale was  for  the result of selling million of available for sale government agency and corporate securities  whose weighted average remaining maturity was approximately one year  for a gain on sale of  and reinvesting the proceeds from the sale into available for sale government agency securities with a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately four years 
this was partially offset by a loss on the sale of a million investment in a short term mortgage backed security bond mutual fund 
management seeks to increase the level of its future fee income from wealth management services and deposits through the increase of its market share within its marketplace 
wealth management fees are not projected to continue to grow at a annual pace as it did in  but are projected to stabilize during and show more moderate growth over the longer term 
fees from deposits are projected to grow approximately in concert with the growth in demand deposit balances  and as result  are expected to be somewhat less than s annual growth of 
income from boli will be less in than due to the effect of the decline in market interest rates over the last two years on the crediting rate on the insurance 
management is not projecting any gains on the sale of securities at this time 
compared to total non interest income increased by  from million in to million in excluding the previously discussed non loan charge off insurance recovery of  before taxes during  total non interest income increased by  or 
non interest income is derived primarily from fee income  which consists primarily of fiduciary and other wms fees  service charges on deposit accounts  and other fee income 
in  the increase was generated primarily from a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
major factors in the increase in service charges on deposit accounts were the impact of the increase in tfb s deposit from year end to year end  as well as management s focus on meeting the needs of its customers with new value added  fee based products 
non interest expense compared to total non interest expense increased  or in from the primary component of this was an increase in salaries and employees benefits of  or  primarily due to the increase in full time equivalent personnel from approximately at year end and at year end to at year end  as well as customary annual salary increases 
the growth in personnel primarily reflects the expansion of the lending function 
significant increases in the defined benefit pension plan expense and the cost of medical insurance benefits also added to increased salary and employees benefit expense in occupancy expenses increased  or  from to primarily due to rent and other leasehold expenses associated with the full year effect of the addition of finance accounting offices in alexandria pike  warrenton  as well as significant growth in snow removal expense during early furniture and equipment increased  or  which correspond with the growth in occupancy expenses 
tfb expects personnel costs  consisting primarily of salary and benefits  to continue to be its largest non interest expense 
as such  the most important factor with regard to potential changes in other expenses is the expansion of staff 
the cost of any additional staff expansion  however  would be expected to be offset by the increased revenue generated by the additional services that the new staff would enable tfb to perform 
during  tfb projects to expand its personnel base primarily to staff its new branch in bealeton  virginia 
similarly  occupancy  equipment  marketing  and other expenses will increase in response to this new branch opening 
compared to total non interest expenses increased million  or in from the primary component of the increase was an increase in salaries and employees benefits of million  or  primarily due to the increase in full time equivalent personnel from approximately at year end and at year end to at year end  as well as customary annual salary increases 
significant increases in the defined benefit pension plan expense and the cost of medical insurance benefits also added to increased salary and employees benefit expense in the growth in personnel primarily reflects the expansion of the wealth management services and lending divisions  and the full year effect of the august opening of the old town manassas branch office 
in addition  occupancy expenses increased  or  from to primarily due to rent and other leasehold expenses associated with the full year effect of the old town manassas office  as well as the addition of administrative offices in alexandria pike  warrenton 
furniture and equipment increased  or  which correspond with the growth in occupancy expenses 
income taxes income tax expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the effective tax rates were for and for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of due to tfb s investment in tax exempt loans and securities  as well as tfb s boli purchase 
income tax expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the effective tax rates were for and for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of due to tfb s investment in tax exempt loans and securities 
financial condition total assets were million at december   an increase of or million from million at december  balance sheet categories reflecting significant changes included cash and due from banks  investment securities  total loans  bank premises and equipment  other assets  and deposits 
each of these categories is discussed below 
cash and due from banks 
cash and due from banks was million at december   reflecting a decrease of million from december  investment securities 
total investment securities were million at december   reflecting a decrease of million from million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of redeploying the proceeds from the prepayment of mortgage backed securities into loans 
at december  and  all investment securities were available for sale 
the valuation allowance for the available for sale portfolio had an unrealized gain  net of tax  of  at december  compared with an unrealized gain  net of tax  of  at december  at december   and  the carrying values of the major classifications of securities were as follows investment portfolio in thousands available for sale obligations of us government corporations and agencies    obligations of states and political subdivisions    corporate bonds    mutual funds  restricted investment federal home loan bank stock    fhlmc preferred stock other securities total    amounts for available for sale securities are based on fair value

loans 
total net loan balance after allowance for loan losses was million at december   which represents an increase of million or from million at december  the majority of the increase was in family residential real estate loans  which increased million from year end to year end  as well as commercial real estate and construction loans  which increased million and million  respectively  over the same time period 
tfb s loans are made primarily to customers located within tfb s primary market area 
during  tfb modified its loan pricing strategies and expanded its loan product offerings in an effort to increase lending activity without sacrificing the existing credit quality standards 
this was primary reason for the year to year increase in residential and commercial real estate loans outstanding 
management will continue the same pricing strategies during  but does not project to originate the same level of family residential real estate loans as in  primarily due to competitive pressures and market interest rates 
bank premises and equipment  net 
bank premises and equipment  net of depreciation  increased million from million at december  to million at december  approximately million of the increase was related to the purchase of land for a branch office in bealeton  virginia to be opened in other assets 
other assets increased million from december  to december  on february   tfb purchased million of boli policies on certain key executives 
boli is recorded at its cash surrender value  or the amount that can be realized 
at december   the cash surrender value of boli was  deposits 
for the year ended december   total deposits grew million or when compared with total deposits one year earlier 
non interest bearing deposits increased by million and interest bearing deposits increased by million 
the growth in tfb s deposits during were the result of many possible factors difficult to segregate and quantify  and equally difficult to use as factors for future projections 
one factor was tfb gaining in market customers who grew dissatisfied with the service and pricing resulting from the consolidation of other local community banks into larger  out of market financial institutions 
another factor may have been the outflow of funds from equity and mutual fund investments into bank deposits 
a third factor may have been gaining deposits from new loan customers

revenues for standby letters of credit were  for the year ended december  at december  there were separate standby letters of credit 
during  only one liability  totaling  arose from the standby letters of credit arrangements 
this liability was offset by an insurance bond payable to tfb 
past history gives little indication as to future trends regarding revenues and liabilities from the standby letters of credit 
capital resources shareholders equity totaled million at december  compared with million at december  the amount of equity reflects management s desire to increase shareholders return on equity by managing the growth in equity 
during the first quarter of  bankshares initiated a dutch auction self tender offer to repurchase shares directly from shareholders 
as a result of this action  bankshares repurchased  shares  as adjusted for stock splits  or of shares outstanding on december   for million

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of bankshares and tfb are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation does 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk an important component of both earnings performance and liquidity is management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income and economic value of equity from a change in market interest rates 
tfb is subject to interest rate sensitivity to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different time intervals than its interest bearing liabilities 
however  tfb is not subject to the other major categories of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
tfb uses a number of tools to manage its interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income under various scenarios  monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios  and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling 
the earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity under varying market rate assumptions 
tfb monitors exposure to instantaneous changes in rates of up to basis points up or down over a rolling month period 
tfb s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net interest income and change in equity from instantaneous changes in interest rates of basis points over months is and  respectively 
management has maintained a risk position well within these guideline levels during the following tables present tfb s market value changes in equity under various rate scenarios as of december  and market risk percentage market minus current plus market percentage dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value pts value change change federal funds sold securities and interest bearing deposits      loans receivable      total rate sensitive assets      other assets    total assets      demand deposits      rate bearing deposits      borrowed funds     other liabilities    total liabilities      present value equity      total liabilities and equity      percentage market minus current plus market percentage dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value pts value change change federal funds sold    securities and interest bearing deposits      loans receivable      total rate sensitive assets      other assets    total assets      demand deposits      rate bearing deposits      borrowed funds      other liabilities    total liabilities      present value equity     total liabilities and equity
