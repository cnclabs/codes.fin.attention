overview we furnish engineering consulting and control system services to the petroleum refining  petrochemical  pipeline  production and processing industries 
our business consists of two segments engineering and systems 
our engineering segment offers engineering consulting services to clients for the development  management and turnkey execution of engineering projects and inspection services 
our systems segment designs  assembles  programs  installs  integrates and services control and instrumentation systems for specific applications in the energy and processing related industries 
in  the engineering segment accounted for of our total revenues for the year  and realized a million increase in its revenues over fiscal year this increase in revenues is primarily attributable to a large co generation project and a large cyclohexane project  both of which originated out of our beaumont office 
we expect to complete the cyclohexane project in the first quarter of and to continue working on the cogeneration project until our engineering segment has been successful in obtaining major projects in the petroleum refining industry along the texas gulf coast  and mid continent area 
however  we do not currently have any projects that would replace the cogeneration project when it is completed 
the systems segment contributed of our total revenues for fiscal  as its revenues improved million from million in to million in this growth is attributable to large fixed price sales of remote instrument enclosures to two clients 
although the revenues for this segment improved over  the gross profit declined due to cost overruns on fixed price projects and competitive market pressures on pricing 
we formerly operated a third segment  the manufacturing segment 
certain assets of this segment were sold in december and its financial results are reported in discontinued operations

index to financial statements results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data derived from our consolidated statements of operations and indicates percentage of total revenue for each item in thousands 
the manufacturing segment is in discontinued operations

total revenue increased by million or from revenues of million in to million in the revenue growth for compared to is primarily attributable to the engineering segment  which was awarded engineering  procurement  and construction epc phases of major projects 
the engineering segment realized an increase in its engineering revenues of million primarily due to two large projects at the beaumont location  a co generation project and a cyclohexane project 
these projects contributed revenues of more than million during  including materials and subcontractors revenues of million 
usually the engineering segment s revenues are derived from direct labor 
procurement activities contributed to a significant increase in revenues but at a lower mark up on these epc projects 
the labor based revenues for engineering were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
by comparison  the procurement based revenues were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
revenues generated from procurement activities are anticipated to be lower in than since the cyclohexane project is concluding in the first quarter of gross profit margins are expected to increase as a percentage of revenues in because the profits on procurement activities are lower than profits on direct labor 
performance in the other areas of the engineering segment was mixed 
significant growth occurred in the tulsa area during with an increase in revenues of  from million in to million in this growth was due to a concerted marketing effort to bring work to this location 
the houston area  which has traditionally serviced the pipeline industry  has had disappointing sales 
the pipeline industry continues to be over leveraged  and capital expansions have been on hold for over two years while the industry focuses on debt reduction 
the economy in the baton rouge area continued to be very disappointing during the early part of  but improved in the fourth quarter 
however  competition in this area resulted in lower margins 
revenues for decreased from by million in the baton rouge area 
fortunately  the fourth quarter showed signs of improvement  baton rouge revenues improved during the last quarter in as compared to the same quarter in the systems segment s revenues improved million from million in to million in esi s revenues improved million from million in to million in this growth was attributable to large fixed price sales of remote instrument enclosures to two clients 
offsetting this increase 
table of contents 
index to financial statements was a decrease in revenues at ecp of million 
as of january  ecp has physically moved into the houston esi location to help reduce its overhead expenses by sharing employees and reducing rent and utility costs 
eti  a previously dormant entity  which was reactivated in  and senftleber  a november acquisition  generated combined revenues of million in the manufacturing segment was discontinued when certain assets of thermaire were sold in december operational results of this segment are reflected in the caption income loss from discontinued operations 
gross profit 
gross profit for the company increased by million or from million in to million in the margin as a percentage of revenue  however  decreased from in to in this decrease is primarily due to the increase in epc types of projects worked in the engineering segment 
the gross profit for the engineering segment increased by million or from to the engineering segment s gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in eei has many contracts pursuant to which englobal employees are assigned to work at client facilities 
these contracts are generally low risk  with virtually no overhead  and therefore  low margin 
also  the engineering service segment  which normally functions as a source of professional labor  was awarded epc jobs in and with large quantities of material and subcontract work 
these jobs have traditionally had low mark ups on the materials and subcontractors work  which deflates the company s margins 
engineering contributed of the total gross profits in despite its lower margins  the company would like to obtain additional epc contracts in  but currently  no such projects are in the company s backlog 
the systems segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in the decline in gross profits was primarily due to cost overruns on fixed price projects and competitive market pressures on contract pricing 
the cost overruns occurred due to rapid growth in esi s revenues 
management has initiated stronger administrative and support services controls in response to the cost overruns 
the company combined three employee medical insurance plans into one self insured health plan at the beginning of claim trends throughout the year were lower than expected levels based on past years experience 
adjustments to lower the insurance reserve were made in the third and fourth quarters totaling million  which resulted in improved gross profits in both engineering and systems segment 
the engineering segment received approximately of the benefit  and the systems segment received approximately of the benefit 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in primarily due to the creation of a business development department  which substantially combined all the marketing activities of the engineering segment into one centralized group and added several new marketing representatives 
we believe this centralized effort will result in better coordination of the company s marketing efforts 
operating profit 
operating profit increased by million or from million in to million in however  operating profits decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in this decrease was the result of the overall higher revenues and lower profit margins 
in march  the company announced organizational changes intended to reduce overhead and enhance profitability 
the company eliminated four operational facilities and consolidated offices to improve efficiency 
for example  ecp was moved into the same facility as esi  effective january  resulting in improved shop personnel utilization  reduction of duplicative overhead functions  and reduction of facility expenses 
additionally  senior management has been realigned to improve operational efficiencies and to better integrate the company s acquisitions into its operations 
other income expense 
other income decreased from  to expense of  from to  respectively 
the expense in is the loss on the sale of the vacant building in baton rouge  as compared to the income in  which resulted from a legal settlement

index to financial statements provision for income taxes 
the company received a one time tax benefit of approximately  in from the recapture of depreciation on segregated expenditures in company owned buildings in baton rouge 
the one time tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate for income taxes from in to 
the company does not expect the benefit to recur in future tax periods 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue 
total revenue increased by million or from million in to million in revenue from the engineering segment  which comprised and of total revenue in and  respectively  increased by million or 
this increase was due to the company s merger with petrocon the engineering segment of which is referred to as eei 
excluding the revenue from the merged company  the change in revenues was a decrease from million in to million in we believe that this decrease was primarily due to the depressed economics of our clients industries  which resulted in restraints on capital expenditures 
in  the beaumont office of eei was awarded a large epc contract with a significant client that generated over million in revenue  net of million in materials purchased as agent 
due to the depressed economy in other areas of the country  revenues in the baton rouge and tulsa offices decreased from million in to million in houston s revenues also decreased from by million as a result of poor economic conditions 
the systems segment contributed of total revenues in revenues increased from million to million in and  respectively 
the increase in sales was due to the acquisition of petrocon systems  inc the systems segment of which is referred to as esi 
esi contributed revenues of million to total revenues 
without the merger  revenues would have decreased from million to million in and  respectively 
the decrease was due to the depressed market conditions in chargers and battery backup systems 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million or from million in to million in gross profit from the pre merger operations decreased in from due to the depressed markets as indicated by lower revenues 
the company decided to maintain key personnel rather than downsize at the risk of losing short term profits 
the merged operations contributed million in gross profits 
the overall margin as a percentage of revenue  however  decreased from to in and this decrease is primarily due to the shift in types of projects worked in the engineering services segment 
the gross profit for the engineering segment increased by million or from to the engineering s gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from to 
many of the projects acquired in connection with the merger were client directed  whereby the employee works at the client site  under the supervision of the client 
these jobs are generally low risk  have virtually no overhead  and intense competition results in low margins 
engineering services contributed of the total gross profits in the systems segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased from in to in this increase was attributable to the merger with petrocon 
esi has higher profit  higher risk  fixed fee projects 
ecp also experienced a write off of inventory in that was not repeated in  thereby increasing margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million in to million in with the larger entity  expenses increased for several overhead departments  including executive  accounting  human resources  safety  information technology  and business development 
due to the increase in revenues  as a percentage of revenues  these expenses decreased by from to in and  respectively 
interest income expense 
the interest income of  resulted from interest on a receivable 
in  the interest expense resulted from an increase in the line of credit increase caused by the petrocon merger

the interest rate on the line of credit is one quarter of one percent plus prime at december   and the commitment fee on the unused line of credit is 
our credit facility with fleet capital corporation requires that we report monthly to fleet on the status of our compliance with our covenants 
the breach of specific covenants  as well as other events  constitute an event of default under the terms of the agreement 
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default  all or any portion of the obligations under the agreement shall  at the option of fleet  become due and payable 
also  while an event of default exists  the principal amount of all loans bears interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent above the current rate 
the company must meet all covenants through the maturity date of the credit facility 
we believe that the company will remain in compliance with all the loan covenants although no assurances can be given that we will be able to do so 
the credit facility between fleet and the company was modified to increase the limit on capital expenditures to million

much of the increase in our cash flow from operating activities is attributable to the growth in our engineering segment 
investing activities used cash totaling  in  compared to million in  they provided  in in  our investing activities consisted of capital additions of million primarily for computers and leasehold improvements to our beaumont office

partially offsetting these expenditures were cash proceeds from the sale of our building in baton rouge and from the sale of thermaire 
financing activities used cash totaling million and million  and provided cash of  during   and  respectively 
our primary financing mechanism is our revolving line of credit with fleet

index to financial statements we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
asset management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit terms and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million from million as of december  and  respectively  primarily due to increased sales in the beaumont area 
some of our contract terms specify a shortened five day payment cycle 
this has reduced the number of days outstanding for trade accounts receivable from days at december  to days at december  bad debt expenses have been insignificant approximately of revenues and of revenues in and  respectively 
we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from  to  or and of the trade accounts receivable balance for and  respectively

rentals paid under the lease were  for each of  and the lease expires in we believe that this lease is at a commercially reasonable rental rate 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially be liable for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage  or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the concurrent negligence of the clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for engineering services or capital expenditures during the year 
the annual budgeting and approval process under which these clients operate is normally not completed until after the beginning of each new year  which can depress results for the first quarter 
principally due to these factors  our revenues during the first and fourth quarters generally tend to be lower than in the second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition our revenues are largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
we recognize service revenue as soon as such services are performed and we recognize revenue from the sales of products upon shipment to the customer 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts  many of which have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
these time and material billings are produced every two weeks

in accordance with statement of position sop  revenues and costs for these type purchases are not included in total revenues and costs 
for financial reporting this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
profits and losses on fixed fee contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs for each contract 
contract costs include amounts paid to subcontractors 
anticipated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed fee contracts 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenues recognized on fixed fee contracts 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying results 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
one example includes the estimates of uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes the accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  and changes in our customers payment trends when evaluating the provisions for bad debts 
goodwill in conjunction with each acquisition  we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as additional information becomes available  adjustments may be made to the original estimates within a short time subsequent to the acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating current market value of the segments  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
consistent with sfas  we have not amortized goodwill related to the merger with petrocon  but instead tested the balance for impairment 
litigation we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business 
based on legal analysis and advice from our attorneys  allowances have been made for any litigation that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of englobal and all wholly owned subsidiaries 
englobal owns of all of its affiliates 
all intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in the consolidation
