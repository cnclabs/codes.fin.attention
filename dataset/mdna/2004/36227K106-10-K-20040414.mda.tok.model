the company expects to return to profitability in and the company s cash flow is expected to be sufficient for its operating needs during however  the company s liquidity can be affected by any of the following significant risk factors the company s business is substantially dependent on sales to the nuclear power industry of revenue in 
spending by companies in this targeted industry is subject to period to period fluctuations as a consequence of industry cycles  economic conditions  political and regulatory environments and other factors 
the company relies on one customer  battelle s pacific northwest national laboratory of revenue in for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect upon the company liquidity 
sales of products and the provision of services to end users outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s revenue in thus  the company is subject to risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from trade or foreign policy 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in preparing the company s financial statements  management makes several estimates and assumptions that affect the company s reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
those accounting estimates that have the most significant impact on the company s operating results and place the most significant demands on management s judgment are discussed below 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates may require adjustment 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
the company uses the percentage of completion revenue recognition methodology to record revenue under its long term fixed price contracts in accordance with the aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
this methodology recognizes income as work progresses on the contract and is based on an estimate of the income earned to date  less income recognized in earlier periods 
the company bases its estimate of the degree of completion of the contract by reviewing the relationship of costs incurred to date to the expected total costs that will be incurred on the project 
the company s project managers are responsible for estimating the costs to be incurred at the beginning of each project and are responsible for updating the estimate as the project progresses 
management reviews the status of each project periodically with the project managers and determines whether the cost estimates are reasonable 
if changes in the estimated costs to complete the projects are required  the cumulative impact on the percentage of completion revenue calculation is recognized in the period identified 
whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract will exceed its total contract value  the company s operating results are charged for the full amount of the estimated losses immediately 
uncertainties inherent in the performance of contracts include labor availability and productivity  material costs  change order scope and pricing  software modification and customer acceptance issues 
the reliability of these cost estimates is critical to the company s revenue recognition as a significant change in the estimates can cause the company s revenue and related margins to change significantly from the amounts estimated in the early stages of the project 
capitalization of computer software development costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company capitalizes computer software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established  but prior to the release of the software product for sale to customers 
once the product is available to be sold  the company begins to amortize the costs over the estimated useful life of the product  which normally ranges from three to five years 
at december   the company has net capitalized software development costs of  on an annual basis  the company assesses the recovery of the unamortized software computer costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product 
if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software costs the company will write down the investment to its estimated fair value based on future discounted cash flows 
the excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related net realizable value is written down and charged to income 
significant changes in the sales projections could result in an impairment with respect to the capitalized software that is reported on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income tax valuation allowance 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
as required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  management makes a periodic assessment of the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
in making this assessment  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income of the company in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred income tax assets to its net realizable value 
at december   the company s deferred tax assets related primarily to a us net operating loss carryforward of million which expire in various amounts over the next twenty years 
the amount of loss carryforward which can be used by the company may be limitied to approximately  annually 
the recovery of the net deferred tax asset could not be substantiated by currently available objective evidence and  accordingly  the company has established a full valuation allowance for the balance of its deferred tax assets of million 
if the company is able to realize taxable income in the future the valuation allowance will be reduced
