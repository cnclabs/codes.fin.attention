acquisitions and other recent transactions on november   we acquired the bone growth stimulation device business from orthologic  which we now operate as our regentek division  for approximately million in cash 
we financed the purchase with cash on hand of million and a portion of the proceeds of a million term loan received in connection with a new credit agreement 
proceeds from the term loan were also used to repay all of our existing bank debt  amounting to approximately million 
the credit agreement also provides us with available borrowings under a million revolving credit facility 
the regentek acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
we acquired all of the operating assets of the bone growth stimulation device business  which is located in tempe  arizona  and approximately employees of the bone growth stimulation device business have become our employees 
the bone growth stimulation products we acquired utilize patented combined magnetic field technology to deliver a highly specific  low energy signal and include the ol for the non invasive treatment of an established nonunion fracture and spinalogic  a device used as an adjunct therapy after primary lumbar spinal fusion surgery 
the bone growth stimulation business represented substantially all of the operating assets of orthologic 
in december  we signed a lease for a  square foot built to suit facility in tijuana  mexico  where we intend to relocate all of our mexico based manufacturing operations in late in october  we commenced direct distribution of our products in france through a new wholly owned subsidiary  dj orthopedics france sas in june  we completed the purchase of specified assets and assumed certain liabilities of dura kold corporation for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the assets acquired from durakold included tangible and intangible assets related to a line of proprietary cold wrap products for orthopedic and medical applications 
we had previously sold the products manufactured by durakold since july under a distribution agreement 
the durakold acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
performance improvement program in  we completed a company wide performance improvement program with the objective of increasing revenues and reducing both costs of goods sold and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues beginning in we retained the services of alixpartners  llc  a consulting firm specializing in corporate performance enhancement  to assist with the performance improvement program 
with the objective of reducing costs by streamlining our organization structure  our performance improvement program included the elimination of several senior management and other positions 
we also moved the manufacturing of all our remaining soft goods and certain non custom rigid braces manufactured in the united states to our manufacturing facilities in mexico 
the move of these manufacturing operations was completed by the end of and resulted in the elimination of approximately united states positions 
more than positions were added in mexico 
the manufacturing move reduced our manufacturing costs beginning in the first quarter of and is intended to provide ongoing manufacturing cost reduction 
in connection with the manufacturing move  a portion of our united states manufacturing facilities was vacated and in we accrued the estimated future net rent that would be paid for the vacated facilities  in excess of estimated sublease income 
in  we decided to retain the vacant space for future expansion and discontinued our efforts to sublease the vacant space 
accordingly  the remaining accrual for rent for the vacant space of million was reversed and credited to operating expenses in other focuses of the performance improvement program included reducing operating expenses  improving the profitability of sales to our third party payor customers  improving working capital management  and improving our business processes and information systems 
we also refocused our resources on our core rehabilitation business and discontinued the marketing of our surgical products and our knee replacement product in in connection with our decision to discontinue marketing our surgical products  all remaining assets of alaron technologies  llc  which we acquired for  in june  were written off in we also divested our interest in our australian joint venture  dj orthopaedics pty ltd  effective december   with no material gain or loss 
the minority owner assumed full ownership of this entity and continues to sell our current products as an independent distributor 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to contractual allowances  doubtful accounts  inventories  rebates  product returns  warranty obligations  income taxes  intangibles and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations provision for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
we maintain provisions for contractual allowances for reimbursement amounts from our third party payor customers based on negotiated contracts and historical experience for non contracted payors 
we also maintain provisions for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have contracts with certain third party payors for our third party reimbursement billings  which call for specified reductions in reimbursement of billed amounts based upon contractual reimbursement rates 
historically through december   we have reserved for and reduced gross revenues from third party payors by between and for allowances related to these contractual reductions 
for  we recorded contractual allowances for our third party payor revenue of to of gross billed charges to third party payors 
our contractual allowances percentages increased in following increases in our current gross price levels 
for our new bone growth stimulation business  we record revenue net of actual contractual allowances and discounts from our gross prices  which are determined on a specific identification basis and amount to approximately to of our gross prices for bone growth stimulation products 
our reserve for doubtful accounts is based upon estimated losses from customers who are billed directly and the portion of third party reimbursement billings that ultimately become the financial responsibility of the end user patients 
direct billed customers represent approximately of our net accounts receivable at december  and we have historically experienced write offs of less than of these accounts receivable 
our third party reimbursement customers include all of the customers of our officecare business segment  the majority of our regentek business segment and certain third party payor customers of our donjoy business segment  including insurance companies  managed care companies and certain governmental payors such as medicare 
our third party payor customers represented approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  and of our net accounts receivable at december  and we estimate bad debt expense to be approximately of gross revenues from these third party reimbursement customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if third party payors were to deny claims for late filings  incomplete information or other reasons  additional provisions may be required 
historically  we relied heavily on third party billing service providers to provide information about the accounts receivable of our third party payor customers  including the data utilized to determine reserves for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
during  we enhanced the ability of our systems to obtain and analyze the information processed by these billing service providers 
our increased ability to obtain and better analyze information beginning in revealed that  as a result of historical third party billing problems  we had experienced an increase in allowances and bad debts for accounts receivable from our third party payor customers and we increased our provisions for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts accordingly in in march  we completed the transition to a new third party insurance billing service provider 
we also continue to enhance our ability to analyze historical information  resolve issues related to our accounts receivable  and reduce our aging 
based on information currently available to us  we believe we have provided adequate reserves for our third party payor accounts receivable 
if claims are denied  or amounts are otherwise not paid  in excess of our estimates  the recoverability of our net accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount 
in addition  if the transition to our new third party insurance billing service provider is not successful  we may be required to increase our reserve estimates 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
we provide reserves for estimated excess or obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories on hand plus future purchase commitments and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
if future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in addition  reserves for inventories on hand in our officecare locations are provided based on historical shrinkage rates of approximately 
if actual shrinkage rates differ from our estimated shrinkage rates  revisions to the reserve may be required 
we also provide reserves for newer product inventories  as appropriate  based on any minimum purchase commitments and the current status of any fda approval process  if required  and our level of sales of the new products 
in connection with our decision  as part of our performance improvement program  to discontinue marketing our alaron surgical products and our knee replacement product  we recorded provisions in to reserve all remaining net inventories related to these products 
we based our reserves for our knee replacement product on inventory amounts in excess of amounts we estimated would be recoverable from our supplier of the knee replacement product who agreed to repurchase the inventory 
in  we received approximately  from the supplier in excess of our original estimate  which we recorded as a reduction of costs of goods sold 
if we receive additional amounts from the supplier in the future  additional credits may be taken 
we also provided reserves in for all remaining net inventories of our orthopulse product based on the inability of the manufacturer of orthopulse to make any material progress in in achieving fda approval for the product 
we also increased our estimates of reserves required for certain other excess inventories in aggregate inventory reserves recorded in in connection with these decisions were million  which is included within costs of goods sold in our consolidated statement of operations for rebates 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebate programs based upon historical experience and estimated revenue levels 
we offer certain of our distributors rebates based on sales volume  sales growth and to reimburse the distributor for certain discounts 
returns and warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of returns and product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on historical trends 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our actual returns and warranty costs could differ from our estimates 
if actual product returns  failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated return and or warranty liabilities may be required 
valuation allowance for deferred tax asset 
as of december   we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related primarily to tax deductible goodwill arising at the date of our reorganization in and not recognized for book purposes and net losses reported during realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately million of future taxable income over the next years 
our management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted future taxable income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess any need for valuation allowances 
goodwill and other intangibles 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased amortization of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual review for impairment 
goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the segment or reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
at october   our goodwill was evaluated for impairment and we determined that no impairment existed at that date 
with the exception of goodwill related to our regentek acquisition of million  we believe that the goodwill acquired through december  benefits the entire enterprise and since our reporting units share the majority of our assets  we compared the total carrying value of our consolidated net assets including goodwill to the fair value of the company 
at december  other intangibles were evaluated for impairment as required by sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the determination of the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the exercise of judgment 
upon initially recording certain of our other intangible assets  including the intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the regentek acquisition  we used independent valuation firms to assist us in determining the appropriate values for these assets 
subsequently  we have used the same methodology and updated our assumptions 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily used the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry averages 
we recorded an impairment charge for certain long lived assets in as a result of certain new products not achieving anticipated revenues and estimated recovery values of assets being disposed of being less than anticipated 
the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets is exposed to future impairments if we experience further declines in operating results  if additional negative industry or economic trends occur or if our future performance is below our projections or estimates 
segments our reportable segments  which  except for regentek  reflect our primary distribution channels  are as follows donjoy  our largest sales channel  comprised of the sale of rigid braces  pain management products and certain soft goods 
approximately independent sales agents who employ approximately independent commissioned sales representatives and a few of our direct sales representatives sell our donjoy products to orthopedic surgeons  podiatrists  orthopedic and prosthetic centers  hospitals  athletic trainers and other healthcare professionals 
the representatives are technical specialists responsible for educating patients on device usage 
after a product order is received by a sales representative  we generally ship the product directly to the orthopedic professional and pay a sales commission to the agent based on sales of such products 
these commissions are reflected in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated financial statements  procare  in which products are sold by approximately direct and independent representatives that manage over dealers focused on primary and acute facilities 
products are sold primarily to national third party distributors  other regional medical supply dealers and medical product buying groups  generally at a discount from list prices 
the majority of these products are soft goods products requiring little or no patient education 
these distributors resell these products to large hospital chains  hospital buying groups  primary care networks and orthopedic physicians for use by the patients  regentek  in which our regentek products are sold through a combination of direct sales representatives and certain independent regional sales agents  with respect to the ol product  and by depuy spine under a exclusive sales agreement  with respect to the spinalogic product 
these products are sold either directly to the patient or to independent distributors 
we arrange billing to the third party payors or patients  for products sold directly to the patient  officecare  in which we maintain an inventory of product mostly soft goods on hand at orthopedic practices for immediate disbursement to the patient 
for these products  we arrange billing to the patient or third party payor after the product is provided to the patient 
in march  we began outsourcing the revenue cycle of this program  from billing to collections  to an independent third party contractor 
the officecare program is also intended to facilitate the introduction of our products to orthopedic surgeons who had not previously been our customers 
as of december   the officecare program was located at over physician offices throughout the united states 
we have contracts with over third party payors for its officecare products  and international  in which our products are sold in foreign countries through wholly owned subsidiaries or independent distributors 
we sell our products in over foreign countries  primarily in europe  australia  canada and japan

commencing may   we began selling products through our subsidiary in canada in canadian dollars and commencing in october  we began selling products through our subsidiary in france in euros 
the us dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies in and were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the pound sterling 
the us dollar equivalent of the related costs denominated in these foreign currencies were unfavorably impacted during the same period 
in addition  the costs associated with our mexico based manufacturing operations are incurred in mexican pesos 
as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results 
occasionally we seek to reduce the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our business through hedging transactions 
at december   we had no hedging transactions in place
