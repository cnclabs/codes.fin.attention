item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following section presents management s review of the financial condition and operating results of vail banks  inc and its subsidiaries collectively vail banks or the company 
it is intended to assist readers in evaluating vail banks performance 
certain reclassifications have been made to previous periods information to conform to the presentation 
the following analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as well as the selected financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this decision  management has identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments 
although management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses calculation process has two components 
the first component represents the allowance for impaired loans computed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas component 
to determine the sfas component  collateral dependent impaired loans are evaluated using internal analyses as well as third party information  such as appraisals 
if an impaired loan is unsecured  it is evaluated using a discounted cash flow of the payments expected over the life of the loan giving consideration to currently existing factors that would impact the amount or timing of the cash flows 
the second component is the allowance calculated under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas component  and represents the estimated probable but undetected losses inherent within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information about a borrower s financial condition  delinquent loans that have not been determined to be impaired  trends in speculative construction real estate lending  results of internal and external loan reviews  and other factors 
this component of the allowance is calculated by assigning a certain risk weighting  within a predetermined range  to each identified risk factor 
at december   an allowance for loan losses of million has been provided 
management believes that this allowance is adequate to cover probable losses based on all currently available evidence 
future additions to the allowance may be required based on management s continuing evaluation of the inherent risks in the portfolio 
additional provisions for loan losses may need to be recorded if the economy resumes a decline  asset quality deteriorates  or historical loss experience changes 
also  state or federal regulators  when reviewing vail banks loan portfolio in the future  may require vail banks to increase the allowance  which could adversely affect vail banks earnings 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses as well as its allocation among certain categories of the loan portfolio can be found in the financial condition section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  management may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires the company to assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at a minimum annually  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for impairment  and the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the goodwill was not impaired as of that date 
the company also performed an annual impairment test of other intangible assets  comprised of core deposit premium  during the fourth quarter of due to the attrition of acquired deposit accounts  the company determined that  of the remaining net book value was impaired and recorded this amount as additional amortization expense during the company also reassessed the remaining useful life of the core deposit intangible asset at december  and determined that it had a remaining useful life of five years 
deferred income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes requires management to exercise judgment about its future results in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million 
management has determined that the likelihood of realization of these deferred tax assets is greater than  and accordingly no valuation allowance has been recorded 
if future taxable income differs from management s estimate  a valuation allowance may be required and will impact future net income 
disclosures of fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosure about fair value of financial instruments requires the company to disclose estimated fair values of its financial instruments 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information 
these estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument 
because no market exists for a portion of the company s financial instruments  fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates 
fair value estimates are based on financial instruments owned at december  and without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments  including deferred tax assets and premises and equipment 
in addition  the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in these estimates 
certain factors affecting forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions and other statements contained in this report that are not historical facts 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  these forward looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth below 
vail banks does not intend to update any forward looking statements whether written or oral  relating to matters discussed in this annual report on form k 
financial overview net income for decreased million  or  to  from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the net interest margin from for to for primarily because of reduced loan volumes and an increase in non interest expense of million  or  to million from million in net income for decreased  or  to million from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the net interest margin from for to for  which was partially offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization expense with the implementation of sfas no 
the return on average assets was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the return on average equity was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  assets increased by million  or  to million during this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million  offset by a decrease in loans held for sale generated by first western of million and a decrease in gross loans of million 
assets decreased by million  or less than  to million during this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net loans of million offset by an increase in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million and an increase in loans held for sale generated by first western of million 
pro forma operating results during june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides guidance on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets after an acquisition has been completed 
specifically  all new and pre existing goodwill will no longer be amortized  but instead will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
amortization of other intangible assets will continue 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas on january  and determined that the net unamortized goodwill of million was not impaired as of that date 
additionally  the company reassessed the useful life of the core deposit intangible asset related to a previously acquired branch 
the company determined that as of january   the core deposit intangible asset had a remaining useful life of twelve years 
accordingly  the  unamortized balance as of january  was to be amortized to expense on a straight line basis over twelve years 
this reduction in remaining life resulted in additional core deposit intangible amortization expense of   after tax for the year ended december  over the comparable period during in addition to the transitional impairment test required as of january   sfas requires that an annual impairment test be performed 
the company performed this annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the goodwill was not impaired as of that date 
the company also reviews its intangible assets other than goodwill for other than temporary impairment on an annual basis 
if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist  recoverability of the asset is assessed based on expected undiscounted net cash flows 
in addition to the impairment test performed on january  upon adoption of sfas  the company performed its annual impairment test of other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of due to the attrition of acquired deposit accounts  the company determined that  of the remaining net book value was impaired and recorded this amount as additional amortization expense during the company also determined that as of december   the core deposit intangible asset had a remaining useful life of five years 
the following table presents comparative net income and earnings per share information as if goodwill amortization expense had not been recorded for in thousands  except share data net income reported net income add back goodwill amortization adjusted net income basic earnings per share reported basic earnings per share add back effect of goodwill amortization adjusted basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share reported diluted earnings per share add back effect of goodwill amortization adjusted diluted earnings per share results of operations net interest income net interest income continues to be vail banks principal source of income  representing the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
in this discussion  net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis fte includes tax exempt income  such as interest on securities of states and municipalities  increased to an amount that would have been earned had such income been taxable 
this adjustment places taxable and nontaxable income on a common basis and permits comparisons of rates and yields 
the following table sets forth the average balances  interest income and expense  and average yields and rates for vail banks earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated on a fully tax equivalent basis 
average balance sheet and net interest income analysis in thousands on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate assets federal funds sold and other short term investments investment securities taxable tax exempt loans total earning assets non earning assets total assets liabilities interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts certificates of deposit total interest bearing deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase short term borrowings long term borrowings trust preferred total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing demand deposits other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity total deposits fte net interest income margin tax exempt securities have been adjusted to an fte basis using a marginal tax rate of in and in and loans are presented net of unearned income and include nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale 
interest income on loans includes loan fees of million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
fte margin has been computed by dividing fte net interest income by total earning assets 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest yields and rates on these assets and liabilities 
an analysis of how changes in volume and yields and rates affected net interest income for the years ended december   and is presented below 
analysis of changes in net interest income over over in thousands volume yield rate total volume yield rate total interest income federal funds sold and other short term investments investment securities taxable tax exempt loans total interest income interest expense interest bearing transaction accounts certificates of deposit securities sold under agreements to repurchase short term borrowings long term borrowings trust preferred total interest expense change in net interest income fte fully taxable equivalent fte 
notes the change in interest that cannot be attributed to only a change in rate or a change in volume  but instead represents a combination of the two factors  has been allocated to the rate variance 
fte net interest income decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the net interest margin on an fte basis was for as compared to for net interest margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity as well as the cost of interest bearing liabilities as compared to the yield on earnings assets 
the decrease in net interest margin during was primarily due to a million decrease in average loan volumes since december  as a result of the soft economy  more conservative underwriting policies  and a temporary internal focus on resolving problem loans 
this resulted in additional liquidity that the company used to purchase lower yielding investments and to sell federal funds 
at the same time  the company capitalized on the low interest rate environment and its wholesale funding source to extend fixed rate financing to several customers  thereby locking in a spread 
these borrowings came at a higher interest cost than deposits 
also contributing to the decrease in net interest margin was the basis point interest rate cut implemented by the federal reserve during second quarter and the basis point cut during november finally  the company deferred more loan fees during compared with during  the company deferred  in loan fees versus  in  reflecting a more conservative approach that more closely recognizes loan fee income over the lives of the related loans 
a portion of the deferral also included fees on long term loans now being funded with long term borrowings  a substantial portion of which will be recognized as income in subsequent quarters 
fte interest income decreased million  or for as compared to despite the fact that earning assets increased million or during the same period 
during  the mix of earning assets continued to shift away from loans and more toward lower yielding investment securities and federal funds sold 
loans had a yield of during as compared to the yield on investment securities and yield on federal funds sold 
during  average loans declined to of earning assets as compared to during as a result of this shift  the total yield on average earnings assets decreased basis points to for  as compared to for interest expense increased  or for as compared to primarily due to an increase in interest bearing liabilities of million during this same period 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities during this period  however  decreased basis points from during to for this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits from during as compared to during the basis point interest rate cut implemented by the federal reserve during second quarter and the basis point cut during november contributed to this lower cost 
fte net interest income decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the net interest margin on an fte basis was for as compared to for the decrease in net interest margin during was primarily due to the multiple interest rate cuts implemented by the federal reserve throughout and in november as well as a shift in the mix of earning assets from loans to investments and federal funds sold  and in interest bearing liabilities from deposits to borrowings 
during  vail banks experienced increased liquidity as the result of a decrease in loan demand attributable to the soft economy and more conservative underwriting policies 
in response  the company completed a short term leverage strategy that enabled it to add income by borrowing from the federal home loan bank fhlb and reinvesting those funds primarily in mortgage backed securities  resulting in a net spread 
although this strategy was designed to add net income  it did  however  have a somewhat negative impact on the net interest margin due to the smaller spread between rates offered on investments and charged on borrowings than would have been generated from the spread between loan and deposit rates 
fte interest income decreased million  or for as compared to despite the fact that earning assets increased million or during the same period 
during  the mix of earning assets shifted away from loans and more toward investment securities and federal funds sold 
loans had a yield of during as compared to the yield on investment securities and yield on federal funds sold 
however  during  average loans declined to of earning assets as compared to during as a result of this shift  the total yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to for  as compared to for interest expense decreased million  or for as compared to despite the fact that interest bearing liabilities increased million during the same period 
this decrease was primarily due to the full year impact of the basis point decline in interest rates that occurred throughout as a result  the total cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for  as compared to for this decrease in cost of interest bearing liabilities  however  was not in proportion to the decrease in yield on average interest earning assets  resulting in an overall decrease in the net interest margin for provision for loan losses the amount of the provision for loan losses is based on regular evaluations of the loan portfolio  with particular attention directed toward non performing  delinquent  and other potential problem loans 
during these evaluations  consideration is also given to such factors as management s evaluation of specific loans  the level and composition of delinquent and non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  results of examinations by regulatory agencies  external and internal asset review processes  the market value of collateral  the strength and availability of guarantees  concentrations of credit and other judgmental factors 
the provision for loan losses was  in  compared to  in and  in the allowance for loan losses of million as of december  decreased from the million level as of december  and represents of total loans and of non performing loans as of december  as compared to and  respectively  at december  the company believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the decreased loan portfolio gross loans were million at december  compared to million at december  with a lower level of non performing loans 
during  average loans decreased million  or  and non performing loans decreased million  or 
net charge offs during were  resulting in a net decrease in the allowance for loan losses of  compared to a net decrease of  during and a net increase of  in the decrease in the provision during was due to the company s determination during that the current allowance for loan losses was adequate to absorb probable losses in the decreased loan portfolio gross loans were million at december  compared to million at december  
at december   the allowance was of total loans and of non performing loans 
while non performing loans increased significantly during to million at december  from million at december  causing the allowance to non performing loans ratio to decline  the majority of the non accrual loans were real estate secured  were recorded at net realizable value  and were subject to foreclosure or other collection proceedings that were underway 
non interest income the following table sets forth vail banks non interest income for the years indicated 
in thousands mortgage broker fees service charges on deposits other fee income rental income gain on sale of foreclosed properties other total non interest income non interest income decreased  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other fee income and service charges on deposits 
other fee income decreased  or  from primarily due to the outsourcing of the company s merchant card program 
during  service charges on deposits decreased  or due primarily to a decline in the number of insufficient funds charges 
rental income decreased during due to several tenant vacancies in rental properties owned by the company 
non interest income grew  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage broker fees partially offset by a decrease in deposit related service charges 
mortgage broker fees increased  or  from due to continued refinancing activity 
during  deposit related income decreased  or due primarily to a decline in the number of deposit account overdrafts and to some degree a general decrease in the number of transaction accounts interest and non interest bearing checking accounts 
non interest expense the following table sets forth vail banks non interest expense for the years indicated 
in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy furniture and equipment loss on sale  disposal or write off of premises and equipment professional fees banking service fees telephone and data communications amortization of intangible assets marketing and promotions retail banking supplies and printing postage and freight litigation settlement other total non interest expense total non interest expense increased million during  or  from million in the increase is primarily due to the write off of premises and equipment  and increases in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  amortization expense on intangible assets  the opening of a de novo branch in denver during the second quarter and the settlement of litigation 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction in retail banking expenses and the company s concerted efforts to reduce operational costs such as postage  supplies and professional fees 
total non interest expense decreased  during  or  from million in the decrease is primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization effective january  and reductions in operational type costs such as postage  supplies and marketing 
these expense reductions were offset by increasing costs of employee related expenses  occupancy expenses and professional fees as well as a full year of operating expenses for the grand junction branch that opened during third quarter during  the company scrutinized its premises and equipment listing and determined that certain premises and equipment were no longer required for the efficient operation of the company 
these premises and equipment were written off during the fourth quarter of resulting in a pre tax charge to income of million 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased  during  or from this increase is primarily due to the opening of a de novo branch in denver during the second quarter which contributed an additional  of compensation expense 
additionally  stock based compensation expense increased  during during  the company recognized compensation expense of  related to grants of restricted stock in additionally  an officer of the company terminated his employment during and all of his restricted stock and stock options became fully vested as of december  the company recognized additional compensation expense of  in related to these shares 
finally  during the company accelerated the stock option vesting of a former officer of the company and recognized additional compensation expense of  expenses associated with premises and equipment  including occupancy  furniture and equipment  rose  and  in and  respectively 
increases in were primarily related to accrued lease termination costs for three closed branches  cost of living increases in facilities rent  increased common area maintenance charges for leased facilities  and the opening of a new branch in denver during increases in were primarily related to a full year of expense related to the grand junction branch opened in  as well as cost of living increases in building rent and property taxes 
amortization of intangible assets in rose  or from the company performed its annual impairment test of other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of due to the attrition of acquired deposit accounts the company determined that  of core deposit premium created by former acquisitions was determined to be impaired and recorded this amount as additional amortization expense during during  amortization of intangible assets decreased million  or 
this decrease was due to the elimination of goodwill amortization effective january  with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
retail banking expenses decreased  or  from this decrease was due to the outsourcing of the merchant card program during first quarter that resulted in decreased merchant card expenses of  during during third quarter  the company settled a lawsuit at a cost of  the lawsuit resulted from actions taken by a former officer at an acquired bank prior to the company s acquisition of such bank 
the efficiency ratio represents non interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and non interest income and is a measure of the cost to generate a dollar of revenue 
the efficiency ratio increased in to from in and in the increase in was primarily due to the decline in revenue net interest income plus non interest income of million over while non interest expenses increased million during the same period 
the increase in was largely due to the decline in revenue net interest income plus non interest income of million over while non interest expenses only decreased  during the same period 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income was for compared with and for and  respectively 
the amortization of goodwill recorded in was primarily non deductible for income tax purposes  thus affecting the effective tax rates 
during and  goodwill amortization was not recorded as a result of adopting sfas no 
on january  other intangibles continued to be amortized during and excluding amortization of non deductible goodwill for  the effective tax rate in would have been 
during  the company had a significant increase in tax exempt interest as a result of municipal bond purchases during this reduction in current income tax expense was offset by additional deferred tax expense associated with the adjustment of the tax bases of certain premises and equipment 
a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this annual report on form k 
financial condition investments at december   the carrying value of investment securities was million  which was an increase of million  or  over million at december  during this period  quality loan demand decreased while deposits continued to grow  resulting in additional funds to invest 
these funds were invested in securities as well as overnight federal funds 
at december   the carrying value of investment securities was million  which was an increase of million  or  over million at december  during this period  quality loan demand decreased while deposits continued to grow  resulting in additional funds to invest 
additionally  the company completed a short term leverage strategy by borrowing from the federal home loan bank and reinvesting those funds primarily in mortgage backed securities 
vail banks investment policy is designed primarily to ensure liquidity and to meet pledging requirements and secondarily to provide acceptable investment income 
management s focus is on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio oriented primarily toward mortgage backed and other government agency securities 
the determination of the amount and maturity of securities purchased is a function of liquidity and income projections based on the existing  and expected  balance sheet and interest rate forecasts 
vail banks is required to account for investment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at the date of purchase  vail banks is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
since its inception  vail banks has not had any trading account activities 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
since the initial classification of its investment securities  vail banks has not transferred any investment securities between categories  nor has it sold any investment securities classified as held to maturity

management believes that the balance sheet information as of the dates indicated should be read in conjunction with the average balance information in the tables above under the caption average balance sheet and net interest income analysis 
vail banks has followed a policy to manage the loan portfolio composition to mitigate risks in specific markets by diversifying the loan portfolio 
however  vail banks does have a concentration of loans in the commercial  industrial and land category 
as a result of seasonal trends in the retail  service and real estate markets  balances of commercial loans may fluctuate significantly 
gross loans outstanding at december  in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial  industrial  and land real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer total at december   gross loans were million  which was a decrease of million  or  over million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the continued softening of the economy  a continued conservative underwriting policy  and a temporary internal focus on resolving problem loans 
at december   non performing loans were million  the lowest level during the past three years 
at december   gross loans were million  which was a decrease of million  or  over million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the softening of the economy and a conservative underwriting policy 
commercial  industrial  and land loans principally include loans to service  real estate and retail businesses and to a small degree  agricultural interests 
these loans are primarily secured by real estate and operating business assets 
commercial  industrial and land loans are made on the basis of the repayment ability and financial strength of the borrower as well as the collateral securing the loans 
real estate construction loans principally include short term loans to fund the construction of buildings and residences or to purchase land for planned and near term commercial or residential development 
these loans are primarily non revolving lines of credit and are secured by real estate  typically well margined with a first security lien 
real estate mortgage loans principally include short term financing for existing one to four family residences 
the majority of these loans have maturities of less than five years 
these loans are secured by the subject real estate  typically well margined with a first lien position 
consumer loans to individuals principally include one to five year loans for consumer items  such as automobiles  motor homes and other goods 
these loans are typically secured  at minimum  by the items being financed 
banking officers are assigned various levels of credit extension approval authority based upon their respective levels of experience and expertise 
credit relationships exceeding million are evaluated and acted upon by the directors credit committee and are reported to the board of directors board on a monthly basis 
vail banks strategy for approving or disapproving extensions of credit is to follow a conservative credit policy and underwriting practices which include extending credit on a sound and collectible basis  investing funds for the benefit of shareholders and the protection of depositors  serving the needs of the community and vail banks general market area while obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk  ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the credit extended  developing and maintaining diversification in the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each loan category  and ensuring that each extension of credit is properly documented and  if appropriate  insurance coverage is adequate 
vail banks credit review and compliance associates interact daily with commercial and consumer lenders to identify potential underwriting or technical exception variances 
in addition  vail banks has placed increased emphasis on early identification of problem loans in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of such situations 
management believes that this strict adherence to conservative credit policy guidelines has contributed to vail banks reduced level of credit losses 
loan maturities the following table presents loans by maturity in each major category at december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual repricing maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
gross loan maturities at december  in thousands within year years a over years a total commercial  industrial and land real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer total a of the loans with maturities over one year  million had adjustable interest rates and the remainder had fixed interest rates 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and foreclosed properties 
when  in the opinion of management  a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest  regardless of the delinquency status of the loan  the accrual of interest income is discontinued and interest accrued but uncollected during the current year is generally reversed through a charge to current year earnings 
while the loan is on nonaccrual status  interest income is recognized only upon receipt and then only if  in the judgment of management  there is no reasonable doubt as to the collectibility of the principal balance 
loans days or more delinquent generally are changed to nonaccrual status unless the loan is in the process of collection and management determines that full collection of principal and accrued interest is probable 
additional interest income that would have been recorded for nonaccrual loans had they been performing in accordance with their contractual requirements was  and  for the years ended december  and actual interest income recorded for these loans was  and  for those years 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including reduction of interest rate below a rate otherwise available to the borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
the following table sets forth information concerning the non performing assets of vail banks as of the dates indicated 
asset quality at december  in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans total non performing loans foreclosed properties total non performing assets loans days or more past due and accruing total risk assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total loans plus foreclosed properties non performing assets to total assets risk assets to total loans plus foreclosed properties during  the company completed foreclosures and subsequent sales of real estate on several large loans that were on non accrual at december   resulting in a decrease in non performing loans and related ratios 
the significant increase in the ratio of non performing loans to total loans from to was primarily a result of the million increase in non accrual loans from compounded by a million decrease in loans during that same time period 
the increase in non accrual loans was a result of the sluggish economy  however  the majority of the non accrual loans are real estate secured  are recorded at net realizable value  and are subject to foreclosure or other collection proceedings that are underway 
the decrease in loans was primarily due to the continued softening of the economy and a continued conservative underwriting policy 
management believes vail banks is adequately collateralized to recover the majority of the balance of these nonaccrual loans 
management generally obtains and maintains appraisals on real estate collateral 
management is not aware of any adverse trends relating to vail banks loan portfolio  not reflected above 
at december   there were no loans excluded from non performing loans set forth above where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in such loans becoming non performing 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses the allowance represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries

weststar lending associates are responsible for ongoing reviews of the quality of the loan portfolio

state and federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  also review weststar s loans and its allowance 
a list containing problem loans is updated and reviewed by management and the board monthly 
in order to comply with certain regulatory requirements  management has prepared the following allocation of vail banks allowance for loan losses among various categories of the loan portfolio for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in management s opinion  such allocation has  at best  a limited utility 
it is based on management s assessment as of a given point in time of the risk characteristics for each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change 
such allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
by presenting such allocation  management does not mean to imply that the allocation is exact or that the allowance has been precisely determined from such allocation 
additionally  during  the company changed its methodology for computing the allowance for loan losses  as discussed above 
a significant portion of the sfas component has not been allocated to each of the four categories specified in the table below  but rather represents loans in all four categories 
it is represented by the term cross allocated in the table below 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses amount in thousands commercial  industrial and land real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer cross allocated unallocated total deposits vail banks primary source of funds has historically been in market customer deposits 
deposit products are concentrated in business and personal checking accounts  including interest bearing and non interest bearing accounts 
generally  deposits are short term in nature with approximately of deposits having a committed term less than three months and approximately having a committed term of less than one year 
vail banks resort locations experience a seasonality of deposits  however  deposits in non resort oriented markets help to mitigate such seasonality 
total deposits were million at december   a million  or a  increase from the balance at december  this increase was primarily related to a focused effort to gather funding in anticipation of a positive turnaround in the economy and greater loan demand 
additionally  the selective pricing of deposit products as well as the maturing of newer branches also contributed to the increase in deposits 
finally  public funds increased million  or  from december  total deposits were million at december   a million  or a  decrease from the balance at december  this decrease was primarily related to deposit attrition resulting from a decline in money market rates  offset by the introduction of a new short term certificate of deposit cd product 
this new cd enabled weststar to attract new money as well as retain funds from maturing cd s

deposits from related parties held by weststar at december  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
such loans and deposits are on the same terms and conditions as then prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non related parties 
on march   the company sold the building in vail  colorado in which a retail office is located 
commissions related to the sale amounting to  were paid to two related parties 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to meet its commitments and obligations with available funds 
these commitments may include paying dividends to shareholders  funding new loans for borrowers  funding withdrawals by depositors  paying general and administrative expenses  and funding capital expenditures 
historically  the company s primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan repayments are also a relatively stable source of funds 
deposit inflows and unscheduled loan repayments  which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions and other factors  are relatively unstable 
other sources of liquidity include sale or maturity of investment securities and the ability to borrow funds 
company borrowing may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
company borrowing may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending and investing activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
cash flows net cash from operating activities during the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by operating activities consisting primarily of net income of  non cash expenses of million and net decreases in operating assets and liabilities from of million 
non cash expenses consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization expense on premises and equipment  a million loss on sale  disposal or write off of premises and equipment   of intangible asset amortization   of net amortization of premium on investment securities  a  loan loss provision  and  of stock compensation expense  offset by a  gain on sales of foreclosed properties   of deferred income tax benefit  and  of deferred loan fee amortization 
the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a million decrease in loans held for sale offset by a  increase in other assets 
this decrease in loans held for sale during the last quarter of was primarily attributable to slowing mortgage refinancing activity 
during the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by operating activities consisting primarily of net income of million and non cash expenses of million  offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities from of million 
non cash expenses consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization expense on premises and equipment   of net amortization of premium on investment securities and a  loan loss provision  offset by  of gains on sales of investment securities

with favorable mortgage interest rates during  refinancings continued to be strong  accounting for the increase in loans held for sale 
the decline in the loan portfolio during resulted in a related decline in the interest receivable on loans 
the increase in interest payable and other liabilities was partly due to the million increase in fhlb borrowings over december  during the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by operating activities consisting primarily of net income of million and non cash expenses of million  offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities from of million 
non cash expenses consisted primarily of million of intangible amortization expense  million of depreciation and amortization expense on premises and equipment  an  loan loss provision and  of deferred income tax expense 
the net increase in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a million increase in loans held for sale offset by an  decrease in interest receivable 
with the multiple interest rate reductions during  loans held for sale increased as a result of increased mortgage refinancings 
additionally  the decline in the loan portfolio and reduced interest rates resulted in a related decline in the interest receivable on loans 
net cash from investing activities during  net cash of million was used by investing activities 
these outflows consisted primarily of million of purchases of investment securities and interest bearing deposits in banks  and the purchase of million of premises and equipment to begin construction of a new building in glenwood springs to replace an existing facility  to remodel several owned buildings and to upgrade equipment 
these outflows were partially offset by the maturity and or calls of million of investment securities  million from the sales of investment securities  a million decrease in net loans  and million from the sales of foreclosed properties 
during  net cash of million was provided by investing activities 
these inflows consisted primarily of a million decrease in net loans  the maturity and or calls of million of investment securities  million from the sales or redemption of investment securities  and million from the sales of premises and equipment

these inflows were partially offset by the million purchase of investment securities and the purchase of million of premises and equipment to construct and furnish the new grand junction branch opened during  to construct a new building in dillon to replace an existing facility  and to upgrade equipment 
net cash from financing activities during  net cash of million was provided by financing activities consisting primarily of an increase in deposits of million and the receipt of million of net proceeds from short and long term fhlb advances 
these inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of million of outstanding common stock of the company  and the payment of dividends on common stock of million 
during  net cash of million was used in financing activities consisting primarily of a decrease in deposits of million  the repurchase of million of outstanding common stock of the company  and the payment of dividends on common stock of million 
these outflows were partially offset by the receipt of million of net proceeds from short and long term fhlb advances 
the decrease in deposits was largely attributable to a decline in money market rates  offset by the introduction of a new short term certificate of deposit product 
this new product enabled weststar to attract new money as well as retain funds from maturing certificates of deposit 
during  net cash of million was used in financing activities consisting primarily of a decrease in deposits of million due to multiple rate cuts during and the withdrawal of a million temporary deposit received during december  the repayment of million of short term borrowings  the repurchase of million of outstanding common stock of the company  and the payment of dividends on common stock of million 
these outflows were partially offset by the receipt of million of proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities and the receipt of million of net proceeds from short and long term fhlb advances 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for are estimated to be between million and million associated primarily with the construction of a new facility in glenwood springs to replace an existing facility  design and construction of a new retail office in fruita  expansion or remodeling of existing facilities  and routine replacement and upgrades of furniture and equipment 
the company will fund these expenditures from various sources  including operating cash flows  retained earnings and borrowings

dividends payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board and is determined after taking into account earnings  capital levels  cash requirements  and the financial condition of vail banks and weststar  as well as applicable government regulations and other relevant factors 
the principal source of vail banks income is dividends from weststar 
there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by weststar to vail banks  as well as by vail banks to its shareholders 
specifically  approval of the regulators will be required if the total of all dividends declared by any banking subsidiary in any year exceeds the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years 
due to the high volume of dividends relative to earnings paid in earlier years  beginning in  any dividend payments from weststar to vail banks will require prior regulatory approval 
management believes that approval will be granted as long as weststar maintains its well capitalized regulatory status 
on january   the board declared a regular quarterly dividend of per share payable to vail banks shareholders of record on january  the dividend of  was paid on february  stock repurchase plan at its meeting on january   the company s board of directors reauthorized the company s stock repurchase program that was originally approved in february the total amount of repurchases under the program  both previously completed and allowable up to january  aggregate approximately million 
since inception of the program through december   the company has repurchased  shares at an average price of per share  or approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit are primarily used to facilitate a trade transaction and are issued with the intent that they will be utilized by the beneficiary as the instrument of payment for goods shipped 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued on behalf of local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the company uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments and letters of credit as for on balance sheet instruments 
united evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amounts of these instruments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments often expire without being used 
the amounts outstanding under these financial instruments are described below as other commercial commitments 
we are not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments or that could significantly impact earnings 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables present the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years fhlb borrowings trust preferred securities operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial commitments a total amounts committed less than year years years over years commitments to extend credit b customer letters of credit total commercial commitments a many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
thus the indicated commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
b commitments to extend credit in the years category primarily represent home equity lines of credit which typically have a five year draw period 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents including federal funds sold of million  interest bearing deposits in banks of million and investment securities of million 
almost of the company s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale and can be readily sold to meet liquidity needs 
based on current plans and business conditions  the company expects that its cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities  together with any amounts generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
concentrations of credit risk concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of counterparties have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in the economy or other conditions 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and real estate loans located in colorado  making the value of the portfolio susceptible to declines in real estate values and other changes in economic conditions in colorado 
the company does not believe it has excessive exposure to any individual customer 
effect of inflation and changing prices the banking industry is unique in that substantially all of the assets and liabilities are of a monetary nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more profound effect on a bank s performance than does inflation 
although there is not always a direct relationship between the movement in the prices of goods and services and changes in interest rates  increases in inflation generally lead to increases in interest rates 
however  in short periods of time interest rates may not move in the same direction or magnitude as inflation 
asset and liability management vail banks earnings depend to a significant extent on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings 
the net interest margin is highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond vail banks control 
these factors include competitive and general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
changes in the discount rate or targeted federal funds rate by the federal reserve bank usually lead to general changes in interest rates 
these interest rate shifts affect vail banks interest income  interest expense and investment portfolio 
also  governmental policies  such as the creation of a tax deduction for individual retirement accounts  can increase savings and affect the cost of funds 
from time to time  the interest rate structures of earning assets and liabilities may not be balanced  and a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the net interest margin and results of operations of vail banks 
vail banks cannot predict the nature  timing and effect of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies 
the liquidity position of vail banks is monitored by management and its asset liability committee 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income variances in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that are subject to repricing in the near term  including both variable rate instruments and those fixed rate instruments which are approaching maturity 
changes in net interest income can occur when interest rates on interest sensitive assets  such as loans and investment securities  change in a different time period from that of the interest rates on liabilities  such as deposits 
these differences  or gaps  provide an indication of the extent that net interest income may be affected by future changes in interest rates 
a positive gap exists when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities and indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given time period 
with a positive gap  rising rate environments generally enhance earnings  while a declining rate environment has a tendency to depress earnings 
conversely  a negative gap exists when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets 
with a negative gap  rising rate environments usually depress earnings  while declining rate environments tend to enhance earnings 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of vail banks assets and liabilities at december   and sets forth the repricing dates of vail banks interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as vail banks interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
this table indicates vail banks will be in an asset sensitive or positive gap position for the twelve month period ending december  during that period  million of interest earning assets will reprice compared to million of interest bearing liabilities 
this asset sensitive position would generally indicate that vail banks net interest income would decrease should interest rates fall and increase should interest rates rise 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of the repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same 
the table is based on assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment  and since such assumptions can be no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the following table does not necessarily indicate the actual future impact of interest rate movements on vail banks net interest income

vail banks and weststar are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by governmental banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct  material effect on vail banks performance 
vail banks and weststar must meet specific capital adequacy guidelines and weststar must meet guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action that together involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
vail banks and weststar s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require vail banks and weststar to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets  and of tier capital to average assets 
see supervision and regulation in item for explanations of these terms and requirements

qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk arising from the instruments and transactions into which the company enters 
these include loans  securities available for sale  deposit liabilities  and borrowings 
interest rate risk occurs when interest sensitive assets and liabilities reprice at different times as market interest rates change 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that are subject to repricing in the near term  including both variable rate instruments and those fixed rate instruments that are approaching maturity 
for example  if fixed rate assets are funded with floating rate debt  the spread between asset and liability rates will decline or turn negative if rates increase 
additionally  interest rate risk results from changing spreads between asset and liability rates 
interest rate risk is managed by the company s asset liability committee 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
as of december   the company has never used interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposures 
during  the company faces risk primarily from the possibility of lower interest rates 
this is because during  vail banks experienced increased liquidity as the result of a decrease in loan demand and an increase in deposits 
the increase in liquidity was used to invest in investment securities and short term federal funds sold 
this increased liquidity position increased the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet and has made vail banks more sensitive to changes in interest rates at december  than at december  given the company s interest rate gap position at december   if rates fall  asset yields will decline faster than the cost of interest bearing liabilities  leading to a decline in the margin 
the extent of this decline will depend on the degree to which retail deposit rates change relative to market rates 
the reduction in short term rates by the federal reserve during  and effectively repriced a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio 
while it also produced an opportunity to reduce funding costs  at the current level of interest rates  further reductions in funding costs may be more limited
