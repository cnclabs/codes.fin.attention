item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special risk factors and uncertainties impact of financial condition on business 
our overall financial position has impacted our terms of sale with customers 
where our standard terms of sale require deposits upon contract execution and significant payment prior to shipment  some customers who order systems with long lead times have been reluctant to remit the necessary funds or have required that we provide security in the form of standby letters of credit 
we currently cannot provide standby letters of credit with maturities extending beyond the august  maturity of our senior credit facility 
as a result  we may have to continue to accept less than favorable terms on customer orders 
history of losses and potential for future losses 
our net loss for the fiscal year ended april  and was million and million  respectively 
as described in this section and the notes to the financial statements  in may  we began an month plan to significantly restructure our operations 
we believe these restructuring and the related cost cutting initiatives will reduce overall spending 
if our restructuring efforts fail to adequately reduce costs  or if our sales are less than we project  we will continue to incur losses in future periods 
economic weakness in our served markets may adversely affect our ability to meet our sales projections 
compliance with current financing arrangements 
we are operating under an amended credit agreement with our senior lenders and an amended note agreement with our subordinated lender 
the agreement with our senior lenders expires august  and sets forth specific financial covenants to be attained on a quarterly basis 
our subordinated lender has amended the subordinated note agreement 
the revised covenants are similar to the covenants in the amended senior credit facility 
in the event of default  the senior and subordinated lenders together  the lenders may limit our access to borrow funds as needed 
our ability to continue operating is dependent on the lenders willingness to grant access to funds 
if we are unable to obtain 
table of contents the necessary funds  our ability to continue operations would be seriously impaired unless we are able to obtain alternative financing from another source 
in the event of a default  obtaining alternative financing is unlikely  especially in the short term  given our current financial position 
we may be unable to achieve our projected operating results and maintain compliance with the loan covenants which would trigger an event of default with our lenders 
in an event of default  the lenders would be in the position to exercise default remedies which include applying a default interest rate and acceleration of payment schedules for our outstanding debt 
if the debt were called in such a manner  it is unlikely we would be able to pay off our lenders and we would be subject to the authority of our lenders as provided in the credit agreement and also in the amended subordinated note agreement 
our lenders may pursue any number of plans to reduce the outstanding debt  including  in certain circumstances  a liquidation of some or all of our assets 
satisfaction of subordinated debt 
the million initial principal amount of notes issued under the note agreement mature in two installments of million each on april  and our subordinated lender has agreed to defer and capitalize the semi annual interest remittances due from april  through april   which total million  less the million paydown that we made concurrent with the signing of the amendment to the note agreement in july  as a component of the principal balance outstanding 
this unpaid interest accrues interest at the rate of 
in order to satisfy these obligations and to obtain favorable senior financing  we may be required to enter into transactions which could be dilutive to current shareholders such as converting the subordinated debt into equity or selling additional equity 
it is likely that we will not generate sufficient cash from operations to pay installments due on either april  and any agreement that we reach with the subordinated lender could have a material impact on the company  including dilution to existing shareholders 
additional capital 
our credit facilities may not provide us with sufficient capital to pursue all the business opportunities that may be available to us 
in addition  the amended credit agreement expires on august  and we will need to seek either replacement debt  equity financing or a combination of both 
there is no assurance that such financing will be available  or if it is available  that it will be on acceptable terms or that it will be sufficient in amount 
both senior and subordinated credit facilities require payment of significant additional fees if certain reductions in outstanding debt levels do not occur 
retention and replacement of key management 
given our current financial position and substantial losses  we may lose key management personnel and encounter difficulties replacing these positions 
we may have to incur greater costs to attract replacement personnel 
intellectual property rights 
we defend our intellectual property rights because unauthorized copying and sale of our proprietary equipment and consumables represents a loss of revenue to us 
from time to time we also receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights 
the number of these claims may grow in the future  and responding to these claims may require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products  or to pay damages 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of contingencies 
current events lender update 
effective july   we amended our current credit agreement with our senior lenders 
this amendment extends the credit facility s expiration to august  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate in effect from time to time plus currently through october  with stepped quarterly increases of basis points beginning november  the agreement sets forth specific financial covenants to be attained on a quarterly basis  which we believe  based on our financial forecasts  are achievable 
on july   our subordinated lender amended the covenants of the subordinated note agreement in a similar fashion to those covenants agreed to by the senior lenders and will continue to allow the capitalization of the required semi annual interest payments at october  and april   which total million 
any unpaid interest accrues further charges at the rate of 

table of contents restructuring 
since may  we have been executing on a plan intended to return us to profitability through reductions in headcount  consolidation of facilities and operations  and closure or divestiture of selected operations 
we further evaluated the workforce and skill levels necessary to satisfy the expected future requirements of the business 
as a result  we have implemented plans to eliminate redundant positions and realign and modify certain roles based on skill assessments 
we have recorded restructuring charges of million for the year ended april   which are shown in the table below in thousands year ended april  severance benefits facility exit costs professional fees inventory write downs other these charges included employee severance related costs for approximately individuals 
the fiscal reductions to date in the global workforce were made across manufacturing  engineering as well as general and administrative functions 
we have also recorded facility exit costs for the year ended april  primarily as a result of consolidating our two kent facilities into one facility  vacating the manufacturing warehouse portion of our flow europe facility and reducing the space utilized in our swedish manufacturing facility 
we incurred professional fees associated with the restructuring of our debt in july and in addition  we scrapped some obsolete parts  returned surplus parts to vendors or sold parts to third parties  in conjunction with the shutdown of our manufacturing operation in europe and standardization of our product line 
see restructuring accrual information in note to consolidated financial statements 
in february we entered into a relationship with the food partners  llc  an investment banking firm specializing in the food industry  to develop and implement value maximizing strategic alternatives for avure 
when we did not receive an acceptable offer for the business  we terminated the relationship with the food partners  llc and made an interim decision to downsize the business and continue the operation of avure 
recent orders of our food processing and general press product lines will utilize available capacity at current manufacturing levels through december we continue to review the best options for avure

the contained pressure operation  avure  is made up of the food  north america press and international press segments 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales waterjet 
the waterjet operation includes cutting and cleaning operations  which are focused on providing total solutions for the aerospace  automotive  job shop  surface preparation cleaning and paper industries 
for the year ended april   waterjet revenue increased million or to million from million in the prior year  fueled by market demand for our dynamic waterjet and improved global market conditions in the primary industries we serve 
domestically  we recorded a million or revenue increase over the prior year period for sales of our standard waterjet cutting systems  as compared to the domestic machine cutting tool market  which recorded a year over year improvement of  according to the association for manufacturing technology amt 
we do not believe that our shapecutting equipment business is as subject to cyclical fluctuations as the traditional methods tracked by the amt 
the broader machine tool market is recovering from historical lows 
our waterjets are experiencing continued acceptance in the marketplace from their flexibility and superior machine performance 
this recent increase in domestic revenues was further enhanced by improved demand in the domestic automotive and aerospace sectors which included an expansion of our cutting cell applications to non automotive customers 
for the year ended april   domestic waterjet revenues were million  up million or from million for the prior year 
outside the us  waterjet revenue growth was positively influenced by growth in asian revenues which were up million or for the year ended april  to million  compared to million in the prior year 
these increases were driven largely by sales in japan where we experienced strong demand for our surface preparation and shapecutting systems 
within our other international waterjet segment  revenues from 
table of contents our european operations have improved by million or to million during fiscal market specific pricing and standardization of system offerings and a recovering european marketplace contributed to this improvement 
we are typically able to sell our products at higher prices outside the us due to the costs of servicing these markets 
as much of our product is manufactured in the us  the weakness of the us dollar also helped strengthen our foreign revenues 
we also analyze our waterjet revenues by looking at system sales and consumable sales 
systems revenues for the year ended april  were million  an increase of million or  compared to the prior fiscal year due to strong global sales from recovering economic conditions fueled by a weaker us dollar 
consumables revenues also recorded an improvement of or million to million for the year ended april   compared to the prior year consumable revenue of million 
this is due to increased machine utilization by our customers in north and south america and asia  all of which led to higher parts consumption 
consumables revenue continues to be positively impacted by our proprietary productivity enhancing kits and improved parts availability as well as the introduction of flowparts 
com  our easy to use internet order entry system 
avure 
the avure operation includes the fresher under pressure technology as well as general press operations 
fresher under pressure meets the increasing demand in the us for a post packaging  terminal pasteurization like step eg packaged ready to eat meats  the demand for high quality  minimally processed foods eg fresh guacamole and salsas  and the demand to utilize the productivity enhancing capabilities of uhp in food processing eg shellfish  while the general press business manufactures systems which produce and strengthen advanced materials for the aerospace  automotive and medical industries 
for the year ended april   revenues for fresher under pressure were million  representing a million  or improvement  compared to the prior year s revenue of million 
a portion of this increase can be attributed to the reversal in the prior year of million of percentage of completion revenue previously recognized on three food systems one customer based on the customer s failure to fulfill its obligations under the contract terms 
additionally  in fiscal  we were able to record revenue on fiscal orders where we delivered already completed systems 
these orders did not qualify for percentage of completion accounting and the corresponding revenue was recognized upon delivery and acceptance in fiscal of the systems that were sold 
for the year ended april   general press revenues increased or million from million for the prior year to million  on stronger order volume and production 
the majority of this revenue increase occurred in europe and  accordingly  net consolidated revenues in europe have increased over the prior year 
general press revenues will vary from year to year due to the nature of its sales and production cycle 
the sales and production cycle on a general press can range from one to four years 
cost of sales and gross margins 
gross margin for the year ended april  amounted to million or of revenues  as compared to gross margin of million or of revenues in the prior year 
fiscal gross margin was negatively impacted by a number of adjustments posted during the third quarter of that year which totaled million 
excluding these adjustments  the fiscal gross margin percentage would have been 
generally  comparison of gross margin rates will vary year to year depending on the mix of sales  which includes special system  standard system and consumables sales 
gross margin rates on our systems sales are typically less than as opposed to consumables sales which are in excess of 
on average  standard systems carry higher margins than the custom engineered systems  which include general presses 
waterjet margins represented million of the overall margin or of waterjet revenues and avure margins amounted to million or of avure revenues 
waterjet gross margin improved on better overhead absorption in light of higher sales volumes in the year and on fiscal inventory valuation adjustments 
avure gross margins increased on improved production volumes and prior year adjustments related to percentage of completion and inventory valuation 
marketing expenses 
marketing expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year marketing expenses of million 
the decrease stems primarily from the fiscal increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of million recorded based on 
table of contents our previous assessment of the financial conditions of our individual customers and general marketplace conditions 
we have also implemented cost justification measures during fiscal aimed at providing return on invested marketing dollars 
the remainder of the decrease is attributable to the cost of participation by waterjet at the bi annual imts tradeshow 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  marketing expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
research and engineering expenses 
research and engineering expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year s research and engineering expenses of million 
this reduction is related to the timing of research and development work and the increased use of engineers on revenue generating projects 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  research and engineering expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year s general and administrative expenses of million 
the increase is attributable to higher costs of doing business as a public company following the enactment by congress of the sarbanes oxley act of and includes increased directors and officers liability insurance as well as higher consulting costs for internal control work and other special projects 
in addition  we resumed the compensation of our board members in fiscal and implemented a performance based bonus plan 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
restructuring charges 
during the year ended april   we incurred million of restructuring related costs  including severance  lease termination and consultant costs  primarily in the us  germany and sweden 
impairment charges 
there were no impairment charges in fiscal during fiscal  we conducted a selected review of the carrying value of our goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires a company to perform impairment testing when certain triggering events affecting a business unit have taken place 
the triggering events were the expectation of a sale or full or partial disposal of certain of our divisions and the continuing deterioration of the economic climate 
our review resulted in impairment charges of million during the quarter ended january  the impairment resulted primarily from continued weakness in the automotive industry  as well as weakness in our european operations 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  we prepared an analysis of the fair value of the company s reporting units for our required fas annual assessment 
this assessment  performed as of april   revealed no further impairment 
at april   we also conducted an impairment review of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this review led to a million impairment charge related primarily to the carrying value of the depreciable assets of avure 
operating loss 
we recorded an operating loss of million for the year ended april   as compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
interest and other income expense  net 
fiscal net interest expense increased million or to million compared to the prior year of million due to increased amounts of amortization of fees from our credit facilities and a higher weighted average cost of capital from interest charged on the deferred and capitalized semi annual interest payments to our subordinated lender  john hancock 
included in other income  net is a million gain from the sale of our investment in wgi heavy minerals 
in addition  the weaker dollar has positively impacted our foreign transactions and we have thus recorded currency gains of million in fiscal as the us dollar remains weak  this has also caused other changes in our balance sheet  including an increase in our goodwill and intangible assets due to the translation from foreign currencies 
included in other expense  net for the year ended april   are million of realized foreign exchange transaction losses as well as a million accrual related to a discount agreed to as part of the sale of a substantial portion of our long term notes receivable to a financial institution 

table of contents income taxes 
we are providing for income taxes in jurisdictions where we have generated taxable income 
during fiscal  as a result of foreign asset collateral requirements and the amended credit agreements discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  we were no longer able to permanently defer foreign earnings and recorded a million liability for withholding taxes payable on future repatriation of foreign earnings 
we also recorded a us tax liability of million on foreign earnings which we have decided to no longer permanently defer 
the total million tax liability is offset by a release of the valuation allowance 
in addition  we continue to assess our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the continued losses generated during the quarter and in prior periods  we have determined it appropriate to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our domestic net operating losses  certain foreign net operating losses and certain other deferred tax assets based on the expected reversal of both deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of april   we had approximately million of domestic net operating loss carryforwards to offset certain earnings for federal income tax purposes 
all of these net operating loss carryforwards expire in fiscal net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions amount to million and do not expire 
see note to consolidated financial statements for discussion of tax components 
discontinued operations  net of tax 
as of april   we held one of our service subsidiaries for sale and consequently showed its results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the sale of this subsidiary was consummated may  and resulted in cash proceeds of million and a gain of approximately  the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is  for fiscal and  for fiscal net loss 
our consolidated net loss for fiscal amounted to million  or 
basic and diluted loss per share as compared to a net loss of million  or basic and diluted loss per share in the prior year 
fiscal comprehensive financial review 
during fiscal  we revised our approach to receivable collection  inventory reduction and investigated other cash generating initiatives in response to the continued declined in the economy and our highly leveraged position 
we reviewed the carrying values of those assets that we expected to convert to cash in the short term  as well as long lived tangible and intangible assets and adjusted the carrying value of such assets to reflect their estimated current net realizable value 
in addition  we conducted a review of potential liabilities 
the total adjustments for the year ended april  are included in the consolidated statement of operations 
these adjustments  which are summarized below  were highly influenced by the economic environment our customers and we are facing 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million 
this increase was based on extensive collection efforts and the results of a worldwide receivable by receivable review  including evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions  which had restricted customers ability to pay their account balances 
we evaluated our ability to convert inventories  including evaluation and demonstration units  into cash in the short term by their sale or disposition 
this evaluation led to a total adjustment of million to arrive at the estimated net realizable value of our inventories 
we conducted a detailed review of the carrying value of our goodwill in accordance with fas the triggering events were the expectation of sale or full or partial disposal of certain of our divisions  the continuing deterioration of the economic climate  and our operating losses 
our review resulted in impairment charges of million during the third quarter of fiscal the impairment resulted primarily from continued weakness in the automotive industry  as well poor performance at our european operations 
our required annual fas review as of april  led to no further impairment charges 

table of contents although our former ceo remains obligated to perform consulting services through may  the remaining term of his consulting contract  we determined that no significant future services are likely to be required of him 
therefore we accrued and charged to operations all remaining contractual fees and related benefits aggregating approximately million 
during fiscal  we sold million of long term notes receivable for million 
this discount of million plus an additional accrual of million on potential future notes available for sale were recorded in other expense  net 
we accrued an additional million for potential losses related to several recourse repurchase obligations on european sales 
we have from time to time entered into recourse obligations with third party leasing companies 
in response to continued concerns about the financial health of several customers  we revised our estimate of potential future exposure 
included in the million accrual was  for the estimated loss on the repurchase and subsequent sale of a flex form press system  where we had a recourse obligation for a bankrupt customer 
we sold this unit to an unrelated party in fiscal we had deferred million in professional fees associated with previous ongoing strategic transactions  consisting of a planned equity offering and spin off of avure 
we have abandoned these plans and accordingly expensed all of these fees 
we reversed percentage of completion revenue previously recognized on three food systems one customer based on the customer s failure to fulfill its obligations under the contract terms 
the total revenue reversed in the third quarter of fiscal was million with an associated gross margin of million 
we received new orders for which we plan to deliver already completed systems from inventory 
accordingly  these specific contracts did not qualify for percentage of completion accounting and the corresponding revenue was recognized upon delivery and acceptance in fiscal we assessed our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the magnitude of the losses generated during the fiscal year  we determined it appropriate to establish a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets  with the exception of our swedish operations  amounting to million as well discontinuing  in the near term  any future recognition of deferred tax assets resulting from losses 
based upon our proposed strategy to downsize and streamline our operations and convert non core or excess assets to cash  we adjusted various other asset values and reserves to appropriately reflect their net realizable value on a prospective basis  in accordance with fas these adjustments totaled million for the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales waterjet 
as a result of continued weakness in the machine tool market for the year ended april   waterjet revenue decreased to million from million in the prior year 
domestically  we recorded a million or revenue decrease over the prior year period  as compared to the domestic machine cutting tool market  which recorded a year over year decline of  according to the association for manufacturing technology 
our shapecutting equipment business continues to outperform the broader domestic market which demonstrates the ongoing application expansion that flow waterjets are experiencing resulting from their flexibility and superior machine performance 
this decrease in domestic revenues was further exacerbated by weak demand in the domestic automotive and aerospace sectors which was offset slightly by an expansion of our cutting cell applications to non automotive customers 
for the year ended april   domestic waterjet revenues were million  down from million for the prior year 

table of contents outside the us  waterjet revenue growth was positively influenced by asia  whose revenues were up for the year ended april  to million  compared to million in the prior year 
these increases were driven largely by sales into china 
additionally  in korea  changes in lending policies have provided capital to small and mid sized businesses flow s traditional customers 
our european operations have been negatively impacted over the past several months by the continued slowing of the overall economy and weakening customer financial stability 
these marketplace conditions have resulted in a significant decrease in waterjet s revenues in europe as compared to the prior fiscal year posting a decrease of million or to million compared to million in in an effort to offset any additional future impact  we have put in place a new general manager  changed our pricing structure and accelerated payment terms 
systems revenues for the year ended april  were million  a decrease of million or  compared to the prior fiscal year due to the impact of revenue decreases in the us and europe 
consumables revenues  on the other hand  recorded a or million improvement to million for the year ended april   compared to the prior year consumable revenue of million 
this is due to increased machine utilization by our customers which has led to higher parts consumption 
avure 
as expected  a portion of the decrease in avure s revenues resulted from reduced general press revenues 
for the year ended april   general press revenues were down from million for the prior year to million 
the majority of this revenue decrease occurred in europe and accordingly net consolidated revenues in europe are down over the prior year 
for the year ended april   revenues for fresher under pressure were million  representing a million  or decline  compared to the prior year s revenue of million 
a portion of this decrease can be attributed to the million reversal of percentage of completion revenue previously recognized on three food systems one customer based on the customer s failure to fulfill its obligations under the contract terms 
in addition  we received some orders for which we plan to deliver already completed systems 
accordingly  these specific orders do not qualify for percentage of completion accounting and the corresponding revenue will be recognized upon delivery and acceptance in a later period 
cost of sales and gross margins 
gross margin for the year ended april  amounted to million or of revenues  as compared to gross margin of million or of revenues in the prior year 
fiscal gross margin was significantly impacted by a number of adjustments posted during our third quarter  which are described below 
generally  comparison of gross margin rates will vary year to year depending on the mix of sales  which includes special system  standard system and consumables sales 
waterjet margins represented million of the overall margin or of waterjet revenues  while avure margins amounted to million or of avure revenues 
both of our business operations experienced decreased margins resulting in part from adjustments made to the carrying value of inventories to net realizable value  amounting to million in both segments or of revenues 
waterjet gross margin was further depressed by weak sales in the automotive and aerospace business which resulted in underabsorption of overhead costs 
in addition  the weakened european economy has led to a change in estimate on several revenue projects in which we had a financial obligation to a third party 
gross margins were negatively impacted by million due to increased revenue reserves based on this change in estimate 
additionally  the decrease in avure gross margins dollars resulted from the revenue reversal of three units due to the customer s failure to fulfill contractual obligations as well as an accrual for the anticipated loss of a general press unit on which the customer defaulted 
these adjustments amounted to million or of total revenues 
marketing expenses 
marketing expenses increased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year marketing expenses of million 
the increase stems primarily from an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during the year as a result of our assessment of the financial conditions of our individual customers and general marketplace conditions 
the remainder of the increase is attributable to the completion of the investment in the marketing organization and infrastructure of avure  which now has a complete sales team  and the cost of participation by waterjet at the bi annual imts tradeshow 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  marketing expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 

table of contents research and engineering expenses 
research and engineering expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year s research and engineering expenses of million 
this reduction is due to our focused global realignment of resources and overall cost cutting efforts 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  research and engineering expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year s general and administrative expenses of million 
these increases stemmed in part from the accrual of our former ceo s severance  the write off of previously deferred professional fees associated with an anticipated equity offering and recruitment and other expenses associated with the hiring of stephen light as the new president and ceo 
additionally  a portion of the increase was due to avure s executive management team being in place for the full year  and only part of the prior year  as well as additional costs associated with bank amendments 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
impairment charges 
at january   we conducted a selected review of the carrying value of our goodwill 
fas requires a company to perform impairment testing when certain triggering events affecting a business unit have taken place 
the triggering events were the expectation of a sale or full or partial disposal of certain of our divisions and the continuing deterioration of the economic climate 
our review resulted in impairment charges of million during the quarter ended january  the impairment resulted primarily from continued weakness in the automotive industry  as well as weakness in our european operations 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  we prepared an analysis of the fair value of the company s reporting units for our required fas annual assessment 
this assessment  performed as of april   revealed no further impairment 
during the year ended april   we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million due to weakness in the automotive industry 
at april   we also conducted an impairment review of our long lived assets in accordance with fas this review led to a million impairment charge related primarily to the carrying value of the depreciable assets of avure 
operating loss 
we recorded an operating loss of million for the year ended april   as compared to operating income of million in the prior year 
interest and other expense  net 
fiscal net interest expense increased million or to million compared to the prior year of million due to a higher weighted average cost of capital and a higher average debt level throughout the first months of the fiscal year 
included in other expense  net are realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses as well as a million accrual related to a discount agreed to as part of the sale of a substantial portion of our long term notes receivable to a financial institution 
we retain no contingent liabilities associated with this sale 
income taxes 
during fiscal  we assessed our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the magnitude of the losses generated during the year  we determined it appropriate to establish a valuation allowance to reduce all previously recognized net deferred tax assets to a level offset by deferred tax liabilities  with the exception of our swedish operation 
the valuation allowance of million  recorded during the third fiscal quarter  on net deferred tax assets generated in prior periods  is included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations and shown as a reduction of both current and long term deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  we did not recognize deferred tax assets associated with any losses generated in the fourth quarter  with the exception of the swedish operations 
discontinued operations  net of tax 
as of april   we held one of our service subsidiaries for sale and have consequently shown its results of operations under discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the sale of this subsidiary was consummated may  and resulted in cash proceeds of million and a gain of approximately  
table of contents the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is  for fiscal and  for fiscal net loss 
our consolidated net loss for fiscal amounted to million  or basic and diluted loss per share as compared to a net loss of million  or basic and diluted loss per share in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources we generated million in cash from operations during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal we generated cash of million from changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily from the reduction of inventories which generated million in cash and from the collection of customer deposits totaling million 
net receivables are comprised of trade accounts and unbilled revenues 
at april   our net receivables balance increased million or from the april  level of million 
in late fiscal  we implemented credit and collection procedures to reduce the extension of credit beyond their due dates 
this has led to a million reduction in trade receivables from million at april  to million at april   an decrease  on significantly higher revenue levels 
however  the decrease in trade receivables was offset by an increase in unbilled revenues 
unbilled revenues increased from million at april  to million at april   a million or a increase 
this increase is the result of stronger demand for our general presses and food systems  as well as increased activity in the automotive and aerospace sectors 
a significant portion of unbilled receivables relates to equipment and systems accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
unbilled revenues fluctuate due to the scheduling of production and achievement of certain billing milestones 
the increase in unbilled revenues is consistent with our expectations based on the factors above 
receivables can be negatively affected by the traditionally longer payment cycle outside the us and the timing of billings and payments on large special system orders 
we do not believe these timing issues will present a material adverse impact on our short term liquidity requirements 
because of the lead time to build and deliver such equipment  ultimate collection of such accounts can be subject to the business and economic conditions facing our customers 
net inventories at april  decreased million or to million from the april  level of million due to our efforts to convert inventories to cash in the short term by their sale or disposition as well as our implementation of initiatives targeted at increasing inventory turns 
gross inventories decreased million or offset by a reduction of million or in the obsolescence reserve as we scrapped some obsolete parts  returned surplus parts to vendors or sold parts to third parties  in conjunction with the shutdown of our manufacturing operation in europe and standardization of our product line 
customer deposits have nearly doubled to million at april   a million increase over the april  balance of million 
we have been working with our customers on our terms of sale which require a substantial portion of any system to be paid prior to its shipment and have seen acceptance from some of our customers 
a substantial portion of our cash is held by divisions outside the us the repatriation of offshore cash balances from certain divisions will trigger tax liabilities 
during fiscal  we decided to no longer permanently defer foreign earnings and recorded a million liability for withholding taxes payable on future repatriation of foreign earnings 
when cash balances are repatriated to the us  they will be used to pay down the senior credit facility 
while we have substantially completed the execution of our restructuring plan  our total commitments include restructuring cash expenditures of between million and million from may to february we have funded these commitments within our existing credit facilities as well as with our cash from operations 
as of april   we have spent million which includes completing the construction of our 
table of contents new million taiwanese facility  to which we had committed in july the facility construction was financed via three unsecured lines of credit with taiwanese banks 
we have also obtained collateralized long term credit facilities and have drawn on these facilities in june we have used the proceeds to repay and permanently reduce the senior credit facility by million 
we anticipate funding the remaining restructuring cash commitments of between million and million within our existing credit facilities and with cash from operations 
we expect that the benefits from our restructuring activities will be reflected in our operating results beginning with fiscal and  we believe  these changes should help us to achieve our forecasts 
in june  we were subject to a value added tax vat audit in germany 
the audit concluded that we owed vat of million including interest 
we had the liability accrued at april  and have remitted the payment to the german taxing authorities in july our senior credit agreement credit agreement is our primary source of external funding 
at april   the balance outstanding on the credit agreement is million against a maximum borrowing of million 
our available credit at april   less million in outstanding letters of credit  is million 
on july   we signed an amendment to the current credit agreement the amendment 
the amendment provides for a revolving line of credit of up to million and an extension of the credit agreement through august  the commitment reduces to million at april  interest rates under the credit facility are at bank of america s prime rate in effect from time to time plus and increase by one percentage point each quarter beginning november  the prime rate at april  was 
the amendment also requires a quarterly commitment fee of of basis points of the total commitment  and issuance of  detachable 
warrants as a fee 
in addition  the amendment specifies compliance with minimum ebitda and collateral levels and provides limits for spending on research engineering as well as capital expenditures 
the amendment also has provisions for mandatory commitment reductions in the event of a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business or in the event of an equity event 
commitment level reductions are based on a percentage of the cash generated by these activities net of applicable fees 
we also amended our subordinated note agreement effective july  the subordinated lenders have also capitalized the semi annual interest remittances due from october  through april   which total million 
this capitalized interest accrues at the rate of 
the subordinated lenders also received  detachable 
warrants as a fee 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
both senior and subordinated credit facilities require payment of significant additional fees if certain reductions in outstanding debt levels do not occur 
the company has incurred losses during fiscal  and in february  we announced a comprehensive two year restructuring plan intended to return the company to profitability through reductions in headcount  consolidation of facilities and operations  and closure or divestiture of selected operations 
we have been able to satisfy our needs for working capital and capital expenditures  due in part to our ability to access adequate financing arrangements 
we expect that operations will continue  with the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
compliance with future debt covenants requires us to meet our operating projections  which include achieving certain revenues  costs  consistent operating margins  and working capital targets 
we believe that our existing cash and credit facilities at april  are adequate to fund our operations through april  if we fail to achieve our planned revenues  costs and working capital objectives  management believes it has the ability to curtail capital expenditures and reduce costs to levels that will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements and debt covenants through april  
table of contents however  demand for our products and timing of cost reductions are difficult to project 
our restructuring initiatives may have unanticipated effects on our business 
if we are unable to comply with the amended debt covenants  and our lenders are unwilling to waive or amend the debt covenants  certain components of our long term obligations and notes payable would become callable  and we would be required to seek alternative financing 
we are continuing to evaluate our current capital structure and may investigate alternative sources of financing 
alternative sources of financing may not be available if required or  if available  may not be on satisfactory terms 
if we are unable to obtain alternative financing on satisfactory terms  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  and we may be required to curtail capital spending  further reduce expenses  and otherwise modify our planned operations including potentially discontinuing operations 
presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at april   by due date 
see notes  and to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding foreign currency contracts  long term debt  and lease obligations  respectively 
in thousands maturity by fiscal year thereafter total contractual obligations not reflected on the balance sheet foreign currency contracts inventory purchases operating leases other subtotal contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet long term debt and notes payable total as these obligations were entered into as hedges  the majority of these obligations will be offset by losses gains on the related assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
as of april   the net settlement of the transactions and related hedges amounts to a gain of  which is included in other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
we have included inventory purchase commitments  which are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities 
these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
these commitments exclude open purchase orders 
these obligations include non inventory vendor commitments  such as professional retainers and trade show commitments 
long term debt obligations  notes payable and lease commitments are expected to be met from working capital provided by operations and  as necessary  by other borrowings 
our capital spending plans currently provide for outlays of approximately million in fiscal  primarily related to information technology spending 
it is expected that funds necessary for these expenditures will be generated internally and through available credit facilities 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments 
table of contents that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these estimates and our accounting policies  refer to note to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for standard systems and consumable and services sales  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that revenue can only be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all four of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criterion is based on our judgments regarding the collectibility of those amounts 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine this criterion is not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we adopted eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables on a prospective basis 
eitf  which was subsequently included in sab  provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of single or multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
for standard systems  our multiple deliverables are the standard system and the installation thereof 
if payment is contingent upon system installation and the system installation does not occur prior to a period end  the system revenue we recognize is the lesser of the cash received or the estimated relative fair value of the system 
the adoption of eitf did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 
for non standard and long lead time systems  including the avure operation  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we use the cost to cost method  measuring the costs incurred on a project at a specified date  as compared to the estimated total cost of the project 
percentage of completion requires management to estimate costs to complete 
accordingly  modifications to estimates will impact percentage of completion revenues and associated gross margins 
if  however  the time from order to install is less than three months  revenue is recognized under sab revenues from equipment on lease are recognized as rental income in the period earned 
shipping revenues and expenses are recorded in revenue and costs of goods sold  respectively 
product warranty reserve our products are generally covered by a warranty up to months 
we accrue a reserve for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of accounts receivable we use estimates in determining our allowance for bad debts that are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs in our receivables 
in determining the appropriate reserve percentages  we also review current trends in the credit quality of our customers  as well as changes in our internal credit policies 

table of contents valuation of obsolete excess inventory we currently record a reserve for obsolete or excess inventory for parts and equipment that are no longer used due to design changes to our products or lack of customer demand 
we regularly monitor our inventory levels and  if we identify an excess condition based on our usage and our financial policies  we record a corresponding reserve 
if our estimate for obsolete or excess inventory is understated  gross margins would be reduced 
valuation of deferred tax assets we review our deferred tax assets regularly to determine their realizability 
when evidence exists that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize a deferred tax asset  we set up a valuation allowance against the asset based on our estimate of the amount which will likely not be realizable 
future utilization of deferred tax assets could result in future income 
impairment of property and equipment  patents  other intangibles and goodwill we evaluate property and equipment  patents and other intangibles for potential impairment indicators when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance  market conditions  legal factors and future plans 
if we conclude that a triggering event has occurred  we will compare the carrying values of the asset with the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from usage of the asset 
if there is a shortfall and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value  we will record an impairment charge for the difference 
we estimate fair value by using a discounted cash flow model 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 
we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment indicators as of our fiscal year end and when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance  market conditions  legal factors  and future plans 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill should be evaluated for impairment prior to our fiscal year end 
our impairment evaluation is based on comparing the fair value of the operating division with its associated carrying value and any shortfalls would require us to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and implied value of goodwill 
we determine fair value by using a discounted cash flow model 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
expected future operational performance is based on estimates and management s judgment 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 
legal contingencies at any time  we may be involved in certain legal proceedings 
as of april   we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and is based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exists in our financial instruments related to an increase in interest rates  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  as well as financial risk management and derivatives 
these exposures are related to our daily operations 

table of contents interest rate exposure at april   we had million in interest bearing debt 
of this amount  million was fixed rate debt with an interest rate of per annum 
the majority of the remaining debt of million was variable at a rate of prime or at april  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional contractual information on our debt obligations 
market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate additional annual charge to our pretax profits and cash flow of  at april   we had no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
we may choose to use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the eurodollar  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swedish krona 
the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations  with functional currencies other than the us dollar  are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
aggregate transaction gains included in the determination of net loss amounted to million for the year ended april  based on our overall currency rate exposure at april   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
at april   we had forward exchange contracts to offset the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we may continue to use derivative instruments  such as forward exchange rate contracts  to manage the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes
