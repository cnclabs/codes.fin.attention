the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we started our business in and began offering our supply automation systems for sale in in late  we introduced our omnicell medication dispensing system 
in january  we expanded our line of medication dispensing systems and customer base with the acquisition of the sure med product line from baxter healthcare corporation 
in august  we acquired aprs  inc to support  develop  and market integrated system solutions to health system pharmacies 
this central pharmacy carousel storage and retrieval solution is sold under our omnicell pharmacy central product name 
in december  we purchased the intellectual property assets of medisafe  a provider of point of care beside automation solutions  called safetymed 
in august  we acquired bcx technology  inc  a provider of open bar code supply management systems branded scanreq  to complement our cabinet based supply solutions 
from inception through december   we had completed our installation obligations  if any  of an aggregate of  of our medication and supply dispensing systems at  healthcare facilities 
we sell our medication and supply dispensing systems primarily in the united states 
we have a direct sales force organized into five regions in the united states 
we sell through distributors in canada  europe  the middle east  asia and australia 
we manufacture the majority of our systems in our production facility in mountain view  california  with refurbishment and spare parts activities conducted in our waukegan  illinois facility 
we recognize revenue when our medication and supply dispensing systems are installed 
installation generally takes place three to six months after our systems are ordered since the acceptance process of our customers includes internal procedures associated with large capital expenditures and the time associated with adopting new technologies 
given the length of time for our customers to complete their acceptance of installation of our systems and to be more predictable and efficient in our manufacturing and installation processes  our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates requested by our customers and on growing product backlog 
our key goals for were to refine our business strategy and increase operating margin 
during  we saw quarterly improvement in backlog  revenue  operating margin and net income 
the significant element of these improvements was our focus on delivering automated end to end solutions for the supply chain management and medication use process for healthcare facilities 
the ability to sell pharmacycentral and safetymed as part of an end to end solution helped us win deals during  although neither of these products represented a meaningful amount of revenue in to continue to compete in every end to end opportunity in the marketplace  we must continue to introduce new products and add new features into our current product lines 
during  we introduced our omnidispenser and safetypak products 
additionally  we have added features such as safetystock bar coding and touch and go biometric fingerprint scanning 
in  working with a partner  we opened our technology center in india to work on projects that enable us to increase our engineering headcount in a cost effective manner 
we built an internal service organization to provide service and support for our products  allowing us to move away from a third party service provider 
in addition  we added a new quality organization focusing on improving manufacturing quality to reduce unit costs and achieve iso certification 
product backlog product backlog is the amount of medication and supply dispensing systems that has shipped over the prior twelve months to customers but is not yet installed at the customer site plus the amount of such systems that has not shipped but for which we have purchase orders 
to facilitate excellent customer service through the timely delivery of our products and services and obtain more predictable and sustainable quarterly growth  we intend to build our product backlog 
we first began reporting our backlog as of september  since that time we have increased our product backlog by million or to million at december  critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as revenue recognition  which are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in addition  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable  accounting for sales of accounts receivable  valuation of inventory  purchased residual interests which are included within other assets  assessment of impairment of goodwill  and accrued sure med upgrade costs  which are included within accrued liabilities 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy significantly impacts our results of operations because it determines the timing of when revenue is recognized 
it also impacts the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and installation expenses  as they are determined by the timing of the recognition of corresponding revenues 
we follow specific and detailed policies on recognizing revenue 
revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
revenues are derived primarily from sales of medication and supply dispensing systems and subsequent service agreements 
the company markets these systems for sale with day or multi year payment terms 
medication and supply dispensing system sales  which are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position  software revenue recognition  are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and installations are complete  omnicell s price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our product revenue is derived from the sale and installation of medication and supply dispensing systems 
we ship our systems based on customer requested installation dates 
our field operations employees generally perform system installations 
the installations are considered complete and revenue is recognizable when the database files are complete  the systems are configured and labeled  our software is installed and deemed functional  the basic interfaces are complete  the systems are in the customer designated locations and the systems have been tested 
prior to recognizing revenue  we require the customer to provide us with an installation confirmation letter that we have completed our obligations 
delays at a customer site due to construction or other causes could result in our inability to install  and therefore recognize revenue 
we also sell our medication and supply dispensing systems through distributors in canada  europe  the middle east  asia and australia 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of our systems to distributors when the distributors have specific purchase orders from identified end users 
revenues from multi year payment arrangements are recognized upon completion of our installation obligation  if any  and at the beginning of the non cancelable payment term 
most of our multi year payment receivables are sold to third party leasing finance companies 
we record revenue at the net present value of the payment stream utilizing an implicit interest rate comparable to those charged by a third party leasing company 
we exclude from revenues any amount paid to us for a new sale that relates to the termination of an existing payment stream 
generally  we have no obligation to the leasing company once the receivable is sold 
in  and  sales of medication and supply dispensing systems sold under multi year payment agreements totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
in  and  customer lease receivables sold to third party leasing companies totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at december  and  accounts receivable included approximately million and million  respectively  due from finance companies for lease receivables sold 
us government customers sign five year non cancelable payment terms but are subject to one year government budget funding cycles 
in our judgment and based on our history with these accounts  we believe these receivables are collectible 
however  in the future  if any of our us government customers do not receive their annual funding  the ability to collect payments on unsold leases could be impaired and may result in a write down of our unsold leases to us government customers 
further  it could impair our ability to make additional sales to us government customers and impair our ability to sell these receivables to third party leasing companies 
as of december  the balance of our unsold leases to us government customers was million 
post installation technical support  such as phone support  on site service  parts and access to software upgrades  when and if available  is provided by us under separate support services terms 
when support services are sold under multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to support services based on its fair value 
we recognize revenue for support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
in addition  we enter into professional services and training arrangements 
we recognize revenue for these arrangements upon performance of such services 
deferred service revenue represents amounts received under service agreements for which the services have not yet been performed 
accounts receivable we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
we typically sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated could differ materially from what will actually be uncollectible in the future 
sales of accounts receivable we offer our customers multi year  non cancelable payment terms 
we typically sell our customers multi year payment agreements to a third party leasing company 
in these sales  we generally transfer customer accounts receivable to the leasing company on a non recourse basis at our book value so no gain is recorded on the transfer 
in these non recourse transfers  we remove the sold receivable from our assets as we have assessed that the sales should be accounted for as true sales in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
if we have overestimated the amount of the receivable sales that should be recorded in this way  our assets and liabilities would need to be increased 
during the fiscal years ended december   and  we have transferred accounts receivable totaling million  million and million  respectively  which approximated fair value  to leasing companies on a non recourse basis 
due to the nature of the recourse clauses in certain of our sales arrangements  we have recorded million of our total sold receivable portfolio of million as of december and million of our total sold receivable portfolio of million as of december  as receivables subject to a sales agreement and obligation resulting from sale of receivables due to recourse clauses in those certain sale arrangements 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
other assets purchased residual interests although we had no contractual obligation to do so  in july we executed an agreement to purchase from americorp financial  inc  or afi  all residual interests in our equipment covered by multi year payment agreements financed by afi 
the total purchase price was million 
the purchase price was assigned to the acquired payment residual interests based on the original implied payment residual value  equipment type and our assessment of the customers likelihood of renewal at the end of the payment term 
as equipment is renewed or upgraded  we charge the assigned value to cost of product revenues 
when equipment is not renewed or upgraded at the end of the contract or when we believe a renewal is unlikely  the assigned value is written off 
the payment streams associated with the purchased residual interests expire at various dates within four years from the date of the purchase agreement 
purchased residual interests are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
if actual demand  market condition or timing of new products introductions differ from those projected by management  the value of purchased residual interests could become significantly impaired 
the value of purchased residual interests included in other assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets at december  we had goodwill and purchased intangible assets with infinite lives of million 
in accordance with the sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we measure such assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
no impairment of goodwill or purchased intangibles with infinite lives was recognized for the years ended december  or we did not have any goodwill or purchased intangible assets with infinite lives in at december  we had purchased intangible assets with finite lives of million 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives include software and customer relationships acquired in a business combination 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of five or six years 
additionally  these intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
no impairment of these intangible assets was recognized for the year ended december  or we did not have any purchased intangible assets with finite lives in accrued liabilities accrued liabilities are based on our judgment of estimated future costs for goods or services already received or obligations incurred 
actual costs may differ from those estimates 
our estimates for accrued customer upgrade costs of million and million as of december  and  respectively  required a significant amount of judgment related to forecasted costs of materials  labor  travel and other costs required to fulfill upgrade obligations to certain sure med customers we assumed under our purchase of sure med in january our estimates can and have changed based on actual costs incurred in completing these obligations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items included in our results of operations for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for these periods year ended december  statement of operations product revenues service and other revenues total revenues cost of product revenues cost of service and other revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring and facility charges purchased in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss product revenues  cost of product revenues and gross profit year ended december  product revenues    cost of product revenues    gross profit    product revenues increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was due to an increase in the number of medication and supply dispensing system installations and an increase in revenue associated with our provision of software programs that interface our systems with our customers systems 
part of this increase can be attributed to a change made to our business model in the third quarter of  when we shifted our focus to building product backlog build to order from product shipments build to ship 
as a result of this change in our strategy  we were able to experience a constant growth in revenues  which is evidenced by sequential growth in each quarter since september revenues also increased as a result of two successful acquisitions  aprs  inc and bcx technology  inc 
in and  respectively 
we expect product revenues in the first quarter of to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter of  and expect sequential quarterly growth throughout the rest of product revenues decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the number of medication and supply dispensing system installations 
the reduction in the number of units installed was partially offset by an increase in the relative proportion of medication dispensing systems sold  which have higher selling prices than our supply dispensing systems 
in addition  we experienced an increase in the average selling prices of our supply dispensing systems in as compared with due to increased customer demand for our higher priced systems 
cost of product revenues increased by million  or  in compared to  and increased by million  or  in compared to gross profit on product sales was million or of product revenues in as compared to million  or of product revenues in and million  or of product revenues in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of product revenues in as compared to was due to the amortization of capitalized costs from purchased intangibles in the acquisitions of bcx technology  inc  medisafe  and aprs  inc  partially offset by a decrease caused by product sales with higher margins 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of product revenues in as compared to was due to fewer higher margin sales  a relatively fixed manufacturing overhead spread over a lower unit volume  and higher installation expense since fewer customers accepted responsibility for their own installations 
in addition  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of product revenues in was due to a write down to lower of cost or market of returned materials and higher storage and shipping costs 
service and other revenues  cost of service and other revenues and gross profit year ended december  service and other revenues    cost of service and other revenues    gross profit    service and other revenues include revenues from service and maintenance contracts  rentals of automation systems  amortization of up front fees received from distributors and monthly subscription fees from hospitals  whose information systems are connected to our web based procurement application 
service and other revenues increased by million or  in compared to and increased by million  or in compared to the increase in and from the prior years were primarily due to the increase in our installed base of automation systems combined with an increase in the number of multi year payment term sales with service contracts 
in addition  we experienced an increase in our e commerce omnibuyer sales 
we anticipate that service and other revenues in on a quarterly basis will be similar to the fourth quarter of  or approximately million per quarter 
cost of service and other revenues increased by million or  in compared to and stayed relatively flat in compared to gross profit on service and other revenues was million  or of service and other revenues in compared to million or of service and other revenues in the increase in gross profit margin on service and other revenues in as compared to is due to a reduction in support and maintenance costs  which tend to decrease after the first six months of product installation 
this reduction in costs was partially offset by costs incurred in transitioning our servicing efforts from an outsourced model  where we utilize a third party service provider to an internal service organization 
we believe that cost of service and other revenues will continue to grow in absolute dollars from service contracts associated with the growth of our installed base of medication and supply dispensing systems 
gross profit on service and other revenues was million  or of service and other revenues in compared to million or of service and other revenues in the increase in gross profit margin on service and other revenues in as compared to reflects a reduction in costs from our third party service provider and the utilization of a higher concentration of refurbished product  for which our costs are minimal  to fulfill our service requirements 
we expect that gross margin on service and other revenues will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to sustain and improve cost efficiencies from our new internal service organization 
operating expenses year ended december  research and development    selling  general and administrative    restructuring and facility charges  purchased in process research and development total operating expenses    research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to and by million  or  in compared to research and development expenses represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was due primarily to a reduction in external consulting  as well as lower salary related expenses as a result of our october and april restructurings which resulted in a reduction of research and development employees  or approximately of total research and development headcount 
the decrease in was due primarily to an increase in the amount of capitalized software development costs relating to a major upgrade to our application software 
in  we capitalized approximately million of software development costs compared to million of software development costs capitalized in additionally  we lowered our research and development spending in our e commerce business to million in from million in we anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources to research and development in future periods to enhance and extend our product and new feature offerings 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to  and increased by million  or  in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses on an absolute dollar basis reflects lower salary related expenses as a result of our october and april restructurings and a reduction in travel costs  partially offset by higher professional fees for legal and accounting services 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses on an absolute dollar basis reflects higher occupancy and travel costs partially offset by lower expenses for bonuses and amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue will increase in  as a result of increases in headcount in order to support planned growth 
restructuring and facility charges 
restructuring and facility charges were million in  million in and million in in and  we restructured our organization to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies 
as part of this restructuring  we reduced headcount by  or employees in  and by  or employees in there is no remaining accrual for restructuring charges as of december  additionally  in december  we incurred facility charges of million to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies related to the move of our corporate headquarters to a new facility in mountain view  california 
in  we reversed the remaining outstanding restructuring accrual from a restructuring charge in in the amount of  related to estimated severance and benefits 
income taxes year ended december  provision for income taxes due to net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards available to us  we recorded minimal total federal and state income tax expense in and impacting was an  tax benefit relating to a change in the calculation of the alternative minimum tax credit for due to a change in the tax law resulting from the job creation and worker assistance act of as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets 
due to our recent operating history  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we have provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
in the event that these attributes are recognized in the future  income tax expense will be reduced by million and million will be credited to paid in capital for unrecognized stock option deductions 
segment information we report segments in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires the use of a management approach in identifying segments of an enterprise 
prior to  the company consisted of one operating segment medication and supply dispensing systems 
a second operating segment was created in the second half of with the introduction of our e commerce business 
our chief operating decision maker reviews information pertaining to reportable segments to the operating income level 
there are no significant inter segment sales or transfers 
assets and capital expenditures of the operating segments are not segregated and substantially all of our long lived assets are located in the united states 
for the years ended december   and  substantially all of our total revenues and gross profit were generated by the medication and supply dispensing systems operating segment 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity  which include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  totaled approximately million as of december  this represented an increase of million compared to million as of december  our funds are currently invested in us commercial and government debt securities 
we generated million and million in net cash from operating activities during and  respectively 
net income was million in compared to a net loss of million in working capital uses of cash occurred in accounts receivable  which increased by approximately million during the increase was due to the overall increase in revenues  which is partially offset by our successful collection strategy 
the days sales outstanding decreased to days in from days in additionally  deferred gross profit decreased by million due to an effort that began in the fourth quarter of to ship product closer to the installation date and recognize revenue sooner 
working capital sources of cash included inventory balances decreasing by approximately million to million as of december  the decrease in inventory levels was a result of the change in our inventory management strategy to built to order toward the end of as a result  the inventory turnover improved during to four times compared to three times during we used million in net cash for investing activities during  compared to million in net cash provided from investing activities during the increase in cash generated from operating activities during compared to resulted in net million purchases of short term investments in additionally  during we used million in net cash to acquire bcx technology  inc to strategically expand our product portfolio and healthcare solutions 
capital expenditures were million in compared to million in  representing mainly information system related purchases 
we generated million and million in net cash from financing activities during and  respectively 
the main financing source of cash during was million in net proceeds from common stock issuances upon exercise of employee stock options and common stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  we received million in net proceeds generated upon collection of notes receivable from stockholders 
we have no notes receivable from any stockholder outstanding as of december  on august   we established with a bank a revolving credit facility and a non revolving credit facility  which together totaled million 
both credit facilities expired on july  at the time of expiration  there were no outstanding borrowings under either of the credit facilities and the company was in compliance with applicable covenants 
we currently have no credit facility arrangements 
we believe our current cash balances and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  if demand for our products and services does not continue as currently anticipated  we may be required to raise additional capital through the public equity market  private financings  collaborative arrangements or debt 
in addition  in certain circumstances we may decide that it is in our best interests to raise additional capital to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  we may be unable to execute our business plan 
we have net operating lease commitments of million payable when due through as follows in thousands total minimum lease payments  we paid the final balance of million in january related to our note payable to americorp financial  inc afi as part of an agreement to purchase all residual interests in omnicell equipment covered by leasing agreements financed by afi 
as part of the acquisition of bcx technology  inc we paid million in january  including an additional million as part of the purchase price and million relating to the achievement of performance milestones in additionally  the acquisition agreement requires us to pay up to an additional million by january   if certain performance milestones are achieved in the years and the first of these milestones of million was achieved as of december  and was accrued as of that date 
we have an obligation to pay million in guaranteed minimum royalties due over four years in equal annual installments of  beginning in january  as part of the december acquisition of substantially all of the intellectual properties of medisafe  a provider of point of care patient safety solutions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
for arrangements entered into after january   fin is effective immediately 
for arrangements entered into prior to february   fin was scheduled to be effective at the end of the period ending after december  in december  fin was revised to require application in financial statements of public entities that have interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after december  for all other types of variable interest entities  application is required for periods ending after march  we do not believe the adoption of the remaining provisions of fin will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we reduce the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are not exposed to currency exchange fluctuations when we sell our products internationally as we manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating all transactions in us dollars 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include fixed rate us government securities and corporate obligations with contractual maturity dates of less than one year 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our short term investments at december  and dollars in thousands  except percentage rates 
december  average fixed interest rate amortized cost  fair value  factors that may affect future operating results any reduction in the demand for or adoption of our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services would harm our business 
our medication and supply dispensing systems represent a relatively new approach to managing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and supplies at healthcare facilities 
many healthcare facilities still use traditional approaches that do not include automated methods of medication and supply dispensing management 
as a result  we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers about the advantages of our products 
our medication and supply dispensing systems typically represent a sizeable initial capital expenditure for healthcare organizations 
changes in the budgets of these organizations and the timing of spending under these budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services 
in addition  these budgets are often characterized by limited resources and conflicting spending priorities among different departments 
any decrease in expenditures by these healthcare facilities  particularly our significant customers  could decrease demand for our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services and harm our business 
we cannot be sure that we will continue to be successful in marketing our medication and supply dispensing systems or that the level of market acceptance of such systems will continue to generate operating income 
the healthcare industry faces financial constraints and consolidation that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services 
the healthcare industry has faced and will likely continue to face significant financial constraints 
for example  the shift to managed care in the s put pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs and the balanced budget act of significantly reduced medicare reimbursement to healthcare organizations 
our automation solutions often involve a significant financial commitment by our customers and  as a result  our ability to grow our business is largely dependent on our customers information technology budgets 
to the extent healthcare information technology spending declines or increases more slowly than we anticipate  demand for our products and services would be adversely affected 
many healthcare providers have consolidated to create larger healthcare delivery organizations with greater market power 
if this consolidation continues  it could erode our customer base and reduce the size of our target market 
in addition  the resulting organizations could have greater bargaining power  which may lead to price erosion 
the medication management and supply chain solutions market is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources 
the medication management and supply chain solutions market is intensely competitive and is characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards  frequent new product introductions and dynamic customer requirements 
we expect continued and increased competition from current and future competitors  many of whom have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
our current direct competitors in the medication management and supply chain solutions market include pyxis corporation a division of cardinal health  inc  mckesson automation inc a business unit of mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen drug corporation through its acquisition of medselect  inc 
pyxis corporation  in particular  has a significantly larger installed base of customers than we do and over the last few years has developed and introduced to the market a significantly larger number of new products 
with the acquisition of omnicell pharmacycentral  safetymed and scanreq and the development of our open systems solutions  we have gained additional competitors 
they include automed  inc and bridge medical  inc both amerisourcebergen drug corporation companies  the baxter medication delivery business of baxter international inc  care fusion  incorporated  cerner corporation  eclipsys corporation  idx systems corporation and siemens medical solutions a division of siemens ag 
the competitive challenges we face in the medication management and supply chain solutions market include  but are not limited to our competitors may develop  license or incorporate new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services  certain competitors have greater name recognition and a more extensive installed base of medication and supply dispensing systems or other products and services and such advantages could be used to increase their market share  other established or emerging companies may enter the medication management and supply chain solutions market  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  including larger  more established companies  thereby increasing their ability to develop and offer products and services to address the needs of our prospective customers  and our competitors may secure products and services from suppliers on more favorable terms or secure exclusive arrangements with suppliers or buyers that may impede the sales of our products and services 
competitive pressures could result in price reductions of our products and services  fewer customer orders and reduced gross margins  any of which could harm our business 
our current and potential customers may have other business relationships with our competitors and consider those relationships when deciding between our products and services and those of our competitors 
many of our competitors are large drug and medical surgical supply distribution companies that sell their distribution services to our current and potential customers 
as a result  if a customer is a distribution customer of one of our competitors  the customer may be motivated to purchase medication and supply dispensing systems or other automation solutions from our competitor in order to maintain or enhance their business relationship with that competitor 
we have a history of operating losses and we cannot assure you that we will maintain profitability 
we had net losses of million and million in and respectively 
while we were profitable with net income of million for the year ended december   we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis 
if the market price of our stock continues to be highly volatile  the value of an investment in our common stock may decline 
for the months prior to march   our common stock has traded between and per share 
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
in addition  our announcements or external events may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock 
these announcements or external events may include our operating results  developments in our relationships with corporate customers  changes in the ratings of our stock by securities analysts  announcement by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new products  or general economic and market conditions 
furthermore  the stock market as a whole from time to time has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future depending on many factors that may include  but are not limited to  the following the size and timing of orders for our medication and supply dispensing systems  and their installation and integration  the overall demand for healthcare medication management and supply chain solutions  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  the number  timing and significance of product enhancements and new product announcements by us or our competitors  the relative proportions of revenues we derive from products and services  our customers budget cycles  changes in our operating expenses  the performance of our products  changes in our business strategy  and economic and political conditions  including fluctuations in interest rates and tax increases 
due to the foregoing factors  our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict 
we have outstanding options that have the potential to dilute shareholder value and cause our stock value to decline 
we frequently grant stock options to our employees and other individuals 
at december   we had options outstanding for  shares of our common stock at option exercise prices ranging from to per share 
if some or all of such shares are sold into the public market over a short time period  the value of our stock may decline  as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at the prevailing market prices 
such sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future on terms that we deem acceptable 
if we experience delays in or loss of sales  or installations of our medication and supply dispensing systems  our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
the purchase of our medication and supply dispensing systems is often part of a customer s larger initiative to re engineer their pharmacy  distribution and materials management systems 
as a result  the purchase of our medication and supply dispensing systems generally involves a significant commitment of management attention and resources by prospective customers and often requires the input and approval of many decision makers  including pharmacy directors  materials managers  nurse managers  financial managers  information systems managers  administrators and boards of directors 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with the sale of our medication and supply dispensing systems is often lengthy and subject to a number of delays over which we have little or no control 
we may experience delays in the future 
a delay in  or loss of  sales of our medication and supply dispensing systems could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could harm our business 
in addition  many of our hospital customers are often slow to install our systems after they are purchased for reasons that are outside our control 
since we recognize revenue only upon installation of our systems at a customer s site  any delay in installation by our customers could also cause a reduction in our revenue for a given quarter 
for all the above reasons  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
fluctuation in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our existing business 
as an element of our growth strategy  we may seek to acquire other businesses  technologies or products in the future 
while we expect to analyze carefully all potential transactions before committing to them  we cannot assure you that any transaction that is completed will result in long term benefits to us or our stockholders  or that our management will be able to integrate or manage the acquired businesses effectively 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties associated with the integration of operations  technologies  products and personnel that  if realized  could harm our operating results 
risks related to potential acquisitions include  but are not limited to uncertain availability of suitable businesses  products or technologies for acquisition on terms acceptable to us  difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from day to day business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and then integrating an acquired business  the discovery  after completion of the acquisition  of liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets acquired that are not realizable  the failure to achieve anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited previous experience 
if our us government customers do not receive their annual funding  our ability to recognize revenues on future sales to us government customers  to sell our us government receivables to third party leasing companies or to collect payments on unsold receivables from us government customers could be impaired 
us government customers sign five year non cancelable payment terms but are subject to one year government budget funding cycles 
in our judgment and based on our history with these accounts  we believe these receivables are collectible 
however  in the future  the failure of any of our us government customers to receive their annual funding could impair our ability to sell to these customers or to sell our us government receivables to third party leasing companies 
in addition  the ability to collect payments on unsold receivables could be impaired and may result in a write down of our unsold receivables to us government customers 
as of december   the balance of our unsold receivables from us government customers was million 
if we are unable to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel  our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
our success is highly dependent upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales  technical and engineering staff 
retaining these existing key personnel will be essential to our continued success 
in addition  we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to attract  train and retain new highly skilled and motivated personnel 
as our products are installed in increasingly complex environments  greater technical expertise will be required 
as our installed base of customers increases  we will also face additional demands on our customer service and support personnel  requiring additional resources to meet these demands 
we may experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
competition for qualified technical  engineering  managerial  sales  marketing  financial reporting and other personnel can be intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
competitors have in the past attempted  and may in the future attempt  to recruit our employees 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with group purchasing organizations or other similar organizations  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
we have agreements with various group purchasing organizations  such as premier  inc  novation  llc  amerinet  inc  healthtrust purchasing group  lp  consorta  inc 
and broadlane  inc  which enable us to sell more readily our products and services to customers represented by these organizations 
our relationships with these organizations are terminable at the convenience of either party 
the loss of any of these relationships could impact the breadth of our customer base and could impair our ability to increase our revenues 
we cannot guarantee that these organizations will renew our contracts on similar terms  if at all and they may choose to terminate our contracts before they expire 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for our medication and supply dispensing systems and our business may suffer if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of components and equipment on a timely basis 
our production strategy for our medication and supply dispensing systems is to work closely with several key sub assembly manufacturers and equipment providers and utilize lower cost manufacturers whenever possible 
although many of the components of our systems are standardized and available from multiple sources  certain components or subsystems are fabricated according to our specifications 
at any given point in time  we may only use a single source of supply for certain components 
our failure to obtain alternative vendors  if required  for any of the numerous components used to manufacture our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could harm our business 
in addition  any failure of a maintenance contractor to perform adequately could harm our business 
if we are unable to successfully integrate our automation solutions with the existing information systems of our customers  they may choose not to use our products and services 
for healthcare facilities to fully benefit from our automation solutions  our systems must integrate with their existing information systems 
this may require substantial cooperation  investment and coordination on the part of our customers 
there is little uniformity in the systems currently used by our customers  which complicates the integration process 
if these systems are not successfully integrated  our customers could choose not to use or to reduce their use of our automation solutions  which would harm our business 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our ability to compete 
we believe that our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for technology and processes and our ability to preserve our trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
we have pursued patent and copyright protections in the united states and foreign jurisdictions for technology and software that we believe to be proprietary and for intellectual property that offers us a potential competitive advantage for our products and we intend to continue to pursue such protection in the future 
our issued patents relate to various features of our medication and supply dispensing systems and we have obtained copyright protection for most of our system software 
there can be no assurance that we will file any patent applications in the future that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that  if issued  such patents will provide significant protection for our technology and processes 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or that others will not design around our patent and copyright protections 
all of our system software is copyrighted and subject to the protection of applicable copyright laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
intellectual property claims against us could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
other than as described below  we do not believe that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of any third parties 
we are aware of one third party patent issued several years ago that may relate to certain of our products 
although we have received no notice alleging infringement from this third party to date  there can be no assurance that such third party will not assert an infringement claim against us in the future 
in the future third parties may claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights with respect to current or future products 
we expect that developers of medication and supply dispensing systems will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we do not possess special insurance that covers intellectual property infringement claims  however  such claims may be covered under our traditional insurance policies 
these policies contain terms  conditions and exclusions that make recovery for intellectual infringement claims difficult to guarantee 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
product liability claims against us could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
our products provide medication management and supply chain solutions for the healthcare industry 
despite the presence of healthcare professionals as intermediaries between our products and patients  if our products fail to provide accurate and timely information or operate as designed  customers  patients or their family members could assert claims against us for product liability 
also  in the event that any of our products are defective  we may be required to recall or redesign those products 
litigation with respect to liability claims  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost to us  divert management s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of product liability claims 
we possess a variety of insurance policies that include coverage for general commercial liability and technology errors and omissions liability 
however  these policies may not be adequate against product liability claims 
a successful claim brought against us  or any claim or product recall that results in negative publicity about us  could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
changing customer requirements could decrease the demand for our products and services 
the medication management and supply chain solutions market is intensely competitive and is characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards  frequent new product introductions and dynamic customer requirements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  our position in the medication management and supply chain solutions market could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing customer requirements 
the process of developing products and services such as those we offer is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly more complex and expensive in the future as new technologies are introduced 
if we are unable to enhance our existing products or develop new products to meet changing customer requirements  demand for our products could decrease 
we may be required to seek additional financing to meet our future capital needs  which we may not be able to secure on favorable terms  or at all 
we plan to continue to expend substantial funds for research and development activities  product development  integration efforts and expansion of sales and marketing activities 
we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in the course of completing the development and marketing of our products or services or in other aspects of our business 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the development of new products and services on a timely basis  the receipt and timing of orders for our medication and supply dispensing systems  the expense of acquiring additional technologies  the cost of developing increased manufacturing and sales capacity  and the timely collection of accounts receivable 
as a result of the foregoing factors  it is possible that we will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that this additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available and may involve restrictive covenants that could affect our ability to pay dividends or raise additional capital 
our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
if our omnicell pharmacycentral  safetymed and scanreq products do not achieve market acceptance  our sales and operating results will be affected 
we acquired two new products in the second half of and one new product in the third quarter of  omnicell pharmacycentral  safetymed and scanreq  all of which we believe are competitive in their respective markets and will meet the demands of our customers for central pharmacy storage and retrieval  bedside automation and open supply management 
our current business goals are dependent in part on customer acceptance of these new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing these products  that these products will compete effectively with similar products sold by our competitors or that the level of market acceptance of such products will be sufficient to generate expected revenues and synergies with our other products 
in addition  deployment of omnicell pharmacycentral  safetymed and scanreq requires interoperability with other omnicell products as well as with healthcare facilities existing information management systems 
if these products fail to satisfy these demanding technological objectives  our customers will be dissatisfied and we may be unable to generate future sales 
failure to establish a significant base of customer references will significantly reduce our ability to sell these products to additional customers 
any deterioration in our relationship with commerce one would adversely affect our web based procurement capabilities 
we have entered into an agreement with commerce one  inc  a provider of business to business technology solutions that link buyers and suppliers of goods and services to trading communities using the internet 
our agreement with commerce one enables us to implement a customized version of commerce one s buysite software at customer sites 
commerce one may license its buysite technology to our competitors 
we cannot guarantee that commerce one will be able to develop and introduce enhancements to its products that keep pace with emerging technological developments and emerging industry standards 
the failure by commerce one in any of these areas could harm our web based procurement capabilities 
government regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect demand for our products 
while the manufacture and sale of our current products are not regulated by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  these products  or our future products  if any  may be regulated in the future 
a requirement for fda approval could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products 
pharmacies are regulated by individual state boards of pharmacy that issue rules for pharmacy licensure in their respective jurisdictions 
state boards of pharmacy do not license or approve our medication and supply dispensing systems  however  pharmacies using our equipment are subject to state board approval 
the failure of such pharmacies to meet differing requirements from a significant number of state boards of pharmacy could decrease demand for our products and harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
similarly  hospitals must be accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  or jcaho  in order to be eligible for medicaid and medicare funds 
jcaho does not approve or accredit medication and supply dispensing systems  however  disapproval of our customers medication and supply dispensing management methods and their failure to meet jcaho requirements could decrease demand for our products and harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
while we have implemented a privacy and use of information policy and strictly adhere to established privacy principles  use of customer information guidelines and federal and state statutes and regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality  we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
this legislation required the secretary of health and human services  or hhs  to adopt national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions  to adopt standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and to establish a schedule for implementing national health data privacy legislation or regulations 
in august  hhs published final modifications to its privacy regulations that took effect on april  these regulations restrict the use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information by our customers who are covered entities under hipaa 
because omnicell may be considered a business associate under hipaa  many of our customers have required that we enter into written agreements governing the way we handle any patient information we may encounter in providing our products and services 
in february  hhs issued final security rules requiring covered entities to implement appropriate technical and physical safeguards of electronically transmitted personal health information by april we cannot predict the potential impact of these rules  rules that have not yet been proposed or any other rules that might be finally adopted on our customers or on omnicell 
in addition  other federal and or state privacy legislation may be enacted at any time 
these laws and regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain  use or disseminate patient information 
this could adversely affect demand for our products or force us to redesign our products in order to meet regulatory requirements 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company that is beneficial to our stockholders 
in february  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that is beneficial to our stockholders 
pursuant to the terms of the plan  when a person or group  except under certain circumstances  acquires or more of our outstanding common stock other than two current stockholders and their affiliated entities  which will not trigger the rights plan unless they acquire beneficial ownership of and or more  respectively  of our outstanding common stock or ten business days after commencement or announcement of a tender or exchange offer for or more of our outstanding common stock  the rights except those rights held by the person or group who has acquired or announced an offer to acquire or more of our outstanding common stock would generally become exercisable for shares of our common stock at a discount 
because the potential acquiror s rights would not become exercisable for our shares of common stock at a discount  the potential acquiror would suffer substantial dilution and may lose its ability to acquire us 
in addition  the existence of the plan itself may deter a potential acquiror from acquiring us 
as a result  either by operation of the plan or by its potential deterrent effect  a change in control of our company that our stockholders may consider in their best interests may not occur 
our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster or any other catastrophic event could cause damage to our facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or curtail operations 
our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including fires  floods  power loss  communications failures and similar events including the effects of war or acts of terrorism 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be seriously or completely impaired or destroyed 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal and accounting compliance costs  and to make some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new option plans 
we expect these and other corporate developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result
