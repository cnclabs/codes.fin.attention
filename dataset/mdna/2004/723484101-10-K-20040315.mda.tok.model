item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item of this report 
overview we own all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to substantially all of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of the tucson metropolitan area and about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area 
through its marketing and trading division  aps also generates  sells and delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the western united states 
aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings 
growth in aps service territory is about three times the national average and remains a fundamental driver of our revenues and earnings 
pinnacle west energy is our unregulated generation subsidiary 
we formed pinnacle west energy in as a result of the acc s requirement that aps transfer all of its competitive assets and services to an affiliate or to a third party by the end of we planned to transfer aps generation assets to pinnacle west energy 
additionally  pinnacle west energy constructed several power plants to meet growing energy needs mw in arizona and mw in nevada 
in september  the acc issued the track a order  which prohibited aps from transferring its generation assets to pinnacle west energy 
as a result of the track a order  we are seeking to transfer the plants built by pinnacle west energy in arizona to aps to unite the arizona generation under one common owner  as originally intended 
suncor  our real estate development subsidiary  has been and is expected to be an important source of earnings and cash flow  particularly during the years through due to accelerated asset sales activity 
our subsidiary  aps energy services  provides competitive commodity related energy services and energy related products and services to commercial  industrial and institutional retail customers in the western united states 
the earnings contributions of our marketing and trading segment significantly decreased over the past two years due to lower market liquidity and deteriorating counterparty credit in the wholesale power markets in the western united states 
the marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps purchased power and fuel risks in connection with aps costs of serving retail customer energy requirements 
we currently expect contributions from our trading activities to be negligible for and approximately million pretax annually thereafter 
we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities 
in the generation area  represented the twelfth consecutive year palo verde was the largest power producer in the united states 
in the delivery area  we focus on superior reliability and expanding our transmission and distribution system to meet growth and sustain reliability 
we believe aps general rate case pending before the acc is the key issue affecting our outlook 
as discussed in greater detail in note in item  in this rate case aps has requested  among other things  a retail rate increase approximately million annually  rate treatment for the pwec dedicated assets and the recovery of million written off by aps as part of the settlement agreement 
in its filed testimony  the acc staff recommended  among other things  that the acc decrease aps rates by approximately approximately million annually  not allow the pwec dedicated assets to be included in aps rate base  and not allow aps to recover any of the million written off as a result of the settlement agreement 
the acc staff recommendations  if implemented as proposed  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position  liquidity  dividend sustainability  credit ratings and access to capital markets 
we believe that aps rate case requests are supported by  among other things  aps demonstrated need for the pwec dedicated assets  aps need to attract capital at reasonable rates of return to support the required capital investment to ensure continued customer reliability in aps high growth service territory  and the conditions in the western energy market 
as a result  we believe it is unlikely that the acc would adopt the acc staff recommendations in their present form  although we can give no assurances in that regard 
the hearing on the rate case is scheduled to begin on may  we believe the acc will be able to make a decision by the end of other factors affecting our past and future financial results include customer growth  purchased power and fuel costs  operations and maintenance expenses  including those relating to plant outages  weather variations  depreciation and amortization expenses  which are affected by net additions to existing utility plant and other property and changes in regulatory asset amortization  and the expected performance of our subsidiaries  suncor and el dorado 
earnings contributions by subsidiary and business segments we have three principal business segments determined by products  services and the regulatory environment our regulated electricity segment  which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses and related activities and includes electricity generation  transmission and distribution  our marketing and trading segment  which consists of our competitive energy business activities  including wholesale marketing and trading and aps energy services commodity related energy services 
in early  we moved our marketing and trading activities to aps from pinnacle west existing wholesale contracts remained at pinnacle west as a result of the acc s track a order prohibiting the previously required transfer of aps generating assets to pinnacle west energy  and our real estate segment  which consists of suncor s real estate development and investment activities

b the other segment primarily includes activities related to el dorado s investment in nac 
we recorded pretax losses of million in  primarily related to nac contracts with three customers 
c consistent with aps october acc filing  aps entered into contracts with its affiliates to buy power through june the contracts reflected prices based on the fully dispatchable dedication of the pwec dedicated assets to aps native load customers customers receiving power under traditional cost based rate regulation 
beginning july   under the acc track b order  aps was required to solicit bids for certain estimated capacity and energy requirements 
pinnacle west energy bid and entered into a contract to supply most of these purchase power requirements in summer months through september see track b order in note for more information 
d aps energy services net income prior to and el dorado s net income loss are primarily reported before income taxes 
the income tax expense or benefit for these subsidiaries is recorded at the parent company 
e in the fourth quarter of pinnacle west energy recorded a charge related to the cancellation of redhawk units and of approximately million after income taxes million pretax 
f as of october   we recorded a million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities  for the early adoption of eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
see note g aps recorded a million after tax charge in for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives related to the adoption of sfas no

see note see note for additional financial information regarding our business segments 
results of operations general throughout the following explanations of our results of operations  we refer to gross margin 
with respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment  gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs 
our real estate segment gross margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of suncor 
other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other operating expenses  which primarily includes el dorado s investment in nac  which we began consolidating in our financial statements in july other gross margin also includes amounts related to aps energy services energy consulting services 
in addition  we have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation  including netting of certain revenues and purchased power amounts as a result of the adoption of eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
see note 
compared with our consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the prior year 
the net income includes a million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities due to the adoption of eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities see note 
excluding the accounting change  the million increase in the period to period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment regulated electricity segment net income was flat when comparing the two years  due to offsetting factors 
net income in was negatively impacted by higher purchased power and fuel costs resulting from higher prices for hedged gas and purchased power  higher costs related to new power plants  net of purchased power savings  higher replacement power costs from plant outages due to higher market prices and more unplanned outages unit of the cholla power plant experienced an unplanned outage from august  through november  and units and of the redhawk power plant were substantially restricted for almost one half of the fourth quarter to correct an equipment design defect  higher operations and maintenance costs related to increased pension and other benefits  two retail electricity price reductions  and higher depreciation expense related to increased delivery and other assets 
these negative factors were offset by higher retail sales primarily due to customer growth and favorable weather  the absence of the write off of redhawk units and  lower operating costs primarily related to severance costs recorded in  lower regulatory asset amortization  tax credits and favorable income tax adjustments related to prior years resolved in  and higher income related to aps return to the afudc method of capitalizing construction finance costs 
marketing and trading segment income from continuing operations decreased approximately million primarily due to lower market liquidity and deteriorating counterparty credit in the wholesale power markets in the western united states 
real estate segment net income improved approximately million primarily due to increased asset  land and home sales 
other segment net income increased approximately million primarily due to nac losses recognized in additional details on the major factors that increased decreased income from continuing operations and net income for the year ended december  compared with the prior year are contained in the following table dollars in millions

see note 
net income for includes income from discontinued operations of million after tax related to our real estate segment see note 
excluding the accounting changes and discontinued operations  the million decrease in the period to period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment regulated electricity segment income from continuing operations increased million primarily due to lower replacement power costs for power plants outages  retail customer growth and higher average customer usage 
these positive factors were partially offset by a write off of redhawk units and  higher operating costs primarily related to severance costs recorded in  retail electricity price decreases  the effects of milder weather  and higher costs for purchased power and gas due to higher hedged gas and power prices 
marketing and trading segment income from continuing operations decreased million primarily due to lower liquidity and lower price volatility in the wholesale power markets in the western united states

other revenues other revenues were million higher in the year ended december  compared with the prior year primarily due to the consolidation of nac s financial statements beginning in the third quarter of liquidity and capital resources capital needs and resources capital expenditure requirements the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for the year ended december  and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years 
capital expenditures dollars in millions actual estimated aps delivery generation a other subtotal pinnacle west energy a b suncor c other d total a as discussed in note under aps general rate case and retail rate adjustment mechanisms  as part of its general rate case  aps requested rate base treatment of the pwec dedicated assets 
pinnacle west energy actual capital expenditures related to pwec dedicated assets were million for and are estimated to be million in  million in and million in b see capital needs and resources by company pinnacle west energy below for further discussion of pinnacle west energy s generation construction program 
these amounts do not include an expected reimbursement by snwa of about million plus capitalized interest  based upon snwa s agreement to purchase a interest in the silverhawk project upon completion in c consists primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction reflected in real estate investments on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
d primarily related to the parent company and aps energy services 
delivery capital expenditures are comprised of t d infrastructure additions and upgrades  capital replacements  new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs 
examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include t d lines and substations  line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems 
aps completed the southwest valley transmission project in at a cost of approximately million 
major transmission projects are driven by strong regional customer growth 
aps will begin major projects each year for the next several years  and expects to spend about million on major transmission projects during the to time frame 
these amounts are included in aps delivery in the table above 
completion of these projects will stretch from through at least generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps existing fossil and nuclear plants and the replacement of palo verde steam generators 
examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions  upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines  boilers and environmental equipment 
generation also includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately million annually for to replacement of the steam generators in palo verde unit was completed during the fall outage of at a cost to aps of approximately million 
the palo verde owners have approved the manufacture of two additional sets of steam generators 
these generators will be installed in unit scheduled completion in and unit scheduled completion in 
our portion of steam generator expenditures for units and is approximately million  which will be spent through in through  approximately million of the unit and unit costs are included in the generation capital expenditures table above and will be funded with internally generated cash or external financings 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes contractual requirements as of december  dollars in millions there after total long term debt payments  including interest a aps pinnacle west suncor el dorado short term debt payments  including interest b capital lease payments operating lease payments minimum pension funding requirement c purchase power and fuel commitments d purchase obligations e nuclear decommissioning funding requirements total contractual commitments a the long term debt matures at various dates through fiscal year and bears interest principally at fixed rates 
interest on variable long term debt is set at the december  rates 
b the short term debt matures within months 
the weighted average interest rate of the short term debt is at december  c if currently pending legislation is enacted  our required pension contribution in would decrease to the to million range 
future pension contributions are not determinable for time periods after d our purchase power and fuel commitments include purchases of coal  electricity  natural gas and nuclear fuel see note 
e these contractual obligations include commitments for capital expenditures and other obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements in  we adopted fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  as it applies to special purpose entities 
fin no 
r requires that we consolidate a vie if we have a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities or we are entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns or both 
a vie is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
in  aps entered into agreements with three separate spe lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap 
see note for further information about the sale leaseback transactions 
based on our assessment of fin no 
r  we are not required to consolidate the palo verde vies 
certain provisions of fin no 
r have a future effective date 
we do not expect these provisions to have a material impact on our financial statements 
aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur 
under certain circumstances for example  the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events  aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions  make specified payments to the equity participants  and take title to the leased unit interests  which  if appropriate  may be required to be written down in value 
if such an event had occurred as of december   aps would have been required to assume approximately million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately million 
guarantees and letters of credit we and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees and letters of credit in support of our unregulated businesses 
we have also obtained surety bonds on behalf of aps energy services 
we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to these obligations 
see note for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit 
credit ratings the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of march  are shown below and are considered to be investment grade ratings 
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies  from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained 
there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies  if  in their respective judgments  circumstances so warrant 
any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west s or aps securities and serve to increase those companies cost of and access to capital 
it may also require additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments see note 
moody s standard poor s pinnacle west senior unsecured commercial paper outlook aps baa p negative bbb a stable senior secured senior unsecured secured lease obligation bonds commercial paper outlook a baa baa p negative a bbb bbb a stable debt provisions pinnacle west s and aps debt covenants related to their respective financing arrangements include a debt to total capitalization ratio and an interest coverage test 
pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet the covenant requirement levels 
the ratio of debt to total capitalization cannot exceed for each of the company and aps individually 
at december   the ratio was approximately for pinnacle west 
at december   the ratio was approximately for aps 
the provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for each of the company and aps 
based on results  the coverages were approximately times for the company  times for the aps bank financing agreements and times for the aps mortgage indenture 
failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which  generally speaking  would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants 
neither pinnacle west s nor aps financing agreements contain ratings triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade 
however  in the event of a ratings downgrade  pinnacle west and or aps may be subject to increased interest costs under certain financing agreements 
all of pinnacle west s bank agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under other agreements 
all of aps bank agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under other agreements 
pinnacle west s and aps credit agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in financial condition or financial prospects 
capital needs and resources by company pinnacle west parent company our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders  interest payments and optional and mandatory repayments of principal on our long term debt see the table above for our contractual requirements  including our debt repayment obligations  but excluding optional repayments and equity infusions into our subsidiaries  primarily pinnacle west energy 
on october   our board of directors increased the common stock dividend to an indicated annual rate of per share from per share  effective with the december  dividend payment 
the level of our common dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  payout ratio trends  free cash flow and financial market conditions 
our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps  external financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries  primarily suncor 
for the years through  total dividends from aps were million and total distributions from suncor were million 
for the year ended december   dividends from aps were approximately million and distributions from suncor were approximately million 
we expect suncor to make cash distributions to the parent company of to million annually in and due to anticipated accelerated asset sales activity 
as discussed in note under acc financing orders  aps must maintain a common equity ratio of at least and may not pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold 
as defined in the financing order  common equity ratio is common equity divided by common equity plus long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt 
at december   aps common equity ratio was approximately 
on may   aps issued million of debt as follows million aggregate principal amount of its notes due and million aggregate principal amount of its notes due also on may   aps made a million loan to pinnacle west energy  and pinnacle west energy distributed the net proceeds of that loan to us to fund our repayment of a portion of the debt incurred to finance the construction of the pwec dedicated assets 
see acc financing order in note for additional information 
with pinnacle west energy s distribution to us on may   we repaid the outstanding balance million under a credit facility 
we used a portion of the remaining proceeds to redeem our million floating rate notes due on june  and to repay other short term debt 
on november   we issued million of our floating rate senior notes due at december   the parent company s outstanding long term debt  including current maturities  was million 
at december   we had unused credit commitments from various banks totaling million  which were available to support the issuance of commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings 
at december   we had no commercial paper outstanding and no short term borrowings 
we ended in an invested position 
pinnacle west sponsors a pension plan that covers employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries 
we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations  but no more than the maximum tax deductible amount 
the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of the fund assets and our pension obligation 
we elected to contribute cash to our pension plan in each of the last five years  our minimum required contributions during each of those years was zero 
specifically  we contributed million for million of which was contributed in june  million for  million for million of which was contributed in  and million for aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the pension contribution  of which aps represents approximately of the total funding amounts described above 
the assets in the plan are mostly domestic common stocks  bonds and real estate 
future year contribution amounts are dependent on fund performance and fund valuation assumptions 
under current law  we are required to contribute approximately million to our pension plans in and expect to contribute approximately million to our other postretirement benefit plan in if currently pending legislation is enacted  our required pension contribution in would decrease to the to million range 
aps aps capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory redemptions of long term debt 
see pinnacle west parent company above and note for discussion of the million financing arrangement between aps and pinnacle west energy approved by the acc in and discussion of a million financing arrangement between aps and pinnacle west 
aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and  to the extent necessary  external financings 
aps has historically paid for its dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations 
see pinnacle west parent company above for a discussion of common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west 
on april   aps redeemed approximately million of its first mortgage bonds  series due  and on august   aps redeemed approximately million of its first mortgage bonds  series due on february   million of aps notes due were redeemed at maturity and on march   million of aps first mortgage bonds  series due were redeemed at maturity 
aps used cash from operations and short term debt to redeem the maturing debt 
aps outstanding debt was approximately billion at december  at december   aps had unused credit commitments from various banks totaling about million  which were available either to support the issuance of commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings 
at december   aps had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings 
aps ended in an invested position 
although provisions in aps first mortgage bond indenture  articles of incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of additional first mortgage bonds  debt and preferred stock that aps may issue  aps does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements 
pinnacle west energy the costs of pinnacle west energy s construction of  mw of generating capacity from through are expected to be about billion  of which billion has been incurred through december  this does not reflect the proceeds from an anticipated sale in to snwa of a interest in the mw silverhawk combined cycle plant miles north of las vegas  nevada  which would equal about million plus capitalized interest of pinnacle west energy s cumulative capital expenditures in the project 
snwa has agreed to purchase a interest in the project upon completion 
such purchase is subject to an appropriation of funds by snwa 
pinnacle west energy s capital requirements are currently funded through capital infusions from pinnacle west  which finances those infusions through debt and equity financings and internally generated cash 
see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures in and projected capital expenditures for the next three years 
see note and pinnacle west parent company above for a discussion of the million financing arrangement between aps and pinnacle west energy authorized by the acc pursuant to the financing order 
other subsidiaries during the past three years  suncor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and its own external financings 
suncor s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction 
see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures in and projected capital expenditures for the next three years

el dorado funded its cash requirements during the past three years  primarily for nac in  with cash infused by the parent company and with cash from operations 
el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 
aps energy services cash requirements during the past three years were funded with cash infusions from the parent company and with cash from operations 
see the capital expenditures table above regarding aps energy services actual capital expenditures for and projected capital expenditures for the next three years 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 
regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in our financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings 
we had million of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december  see notes and for more information about regulatory assets and aps general rate case 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term  and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the projected benefit obligation  our reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our reported pension expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on our consolidated statements of income dollars in millions increase decrease impact on projected impact on impact on benefit pension pension actuarial assumption a obligation liability expense discount rate increase decrease expected long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease a each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and our reported other postretirement benefit expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on our consolidated statements of income dollars in millions increase decrease impact on accumulated impact on other postretirement benefit postretirement actuarial assumption a obligation benefit expense discount rate increase decrease health care cost trend rate b increase decrease expected long term rate of return on plan assets pretax increase decrease a each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant 
b this assumes a change in the initial and ultimate health care cost trend rate

derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  will determine whether we use accrual accounting or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in fair value be recorded in earnings or  if certain hedge accounting criteria are met  in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis 
see note for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 
mark to market accounting the market value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable 
in some cases  we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value 
the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods 
our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis

other accounting matters accounting for derivative and trading activities we adopted eitf effective october  eitf provides guidance on whether realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported on a net or gross basis and concluded such classification is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances 
in the electricity business  some contracts to purchase energy are netted against other contracts to sell energy 
this is called book out and usually occurs in contracts that have the same terms quantities and delivery points and for which power does not flow 
we netted these book outs  reducing both revenues and purchased power and fuel costs in  and  but this did not impact our financial condition  net income or cash flows 
we adopted eitf in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million after tax charge in net income as a cumulative effect adjustment for the previously recorded accumulated unrealized mark to market on energy trading contracts that did not meet the accounting definition of a derivative 
our energy trading contracts that are derivatives are accounted for at fair value under sfas no 
contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are now accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or received 
in  we adopted sfas no 
and recorded a million after tax charge in net income and a million after tax credit in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income  both as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives 
see notes and for further information on accounting for derivatives 
asset retirement obligations on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the standard requires the fair value of asset retirement obligations to be recorded as a liability  along with an offsetting plant asset  when the obligation is incurred 
accretion of the liability due to the passage of time is an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the long lived asset 
see note for more information regarding our previous accounting for removal costs 
we determined that we have asset retirement obligations for our nuclear facilities nuclear decommissioning and certain other generation  transmission and distribution assets 
on january   we recorded a liability of million for our asset retirement obligations including the accretion impacts  a million increase in the carrying amount of the associated assets  and a net reduction of million in accumulated depreciation related primarily to the reversal of previously recorded accumulated decommissioning and other removal costs related to these obligations 
additionally  we recorded a regulatory liability of million for our asset retirement obligations related to our regulated utility 
this regulatory liability represents the difference between the amount currently being recovered in regulated rates and the amount calculated under sfas no 
we believe we can recover in regulated rates the transition costs and ongoing current period costs calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation see note and sfas no 
see note 
adopting sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated statements of income or our consolidated statements of cash flow

factors affecting our financial outlook aps general rate case we believe aps general rate case pending before the acc is the key issue affecting our outlook 
as discussed in greater detail in note  in this rate case aps has requested  among other things  a retail rate increase approximately million annually  rate treatment for the pwec dedicated assets and the recovery of million written off by aps as part of the settlement agreement 
in its filed testimony  the acc staff recommended  among other things  that the acc decrease aps rates by approximately approximately million annually  not allow the pwec dedicated assets to be included in aps rate base  and not allow aps to recover any of the million written off as a result of the settlement agreement 
the acc staff recommendations  if implemented as proposed  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position  liquidity  dividend sustainability  credit ratings and access to capital markets 
we believe that aps rate case requests are supported by  among other things  aps demonstrated need for the pwec dedicated assets  aps need to attract capital at reasonable rates of return to support the required capital investment to ensure continued customer reliability in aps high growth service territory  and the conditions in the western energy market 
as a result  we believe it is unlikely that the acc would adopt the acc staff recommendations in their present form  although we can give no assurances in that regard 
the hearing on the rate case is scheduled to begin on may  we believe the acc will be able to make a decision by the end of wholesale power market conditions the marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of serving retail customer demand 
we moved this division to aps in early for future marketing and trading activities existing wholesale contracts remained at pinnacle west as a result of the acc s track a order prohibiting aps transfer of generating assets to pinnacle west energy 
additionally  the marketing and trading division  subject to specified parameters  markets  hedges and trades in electricity  fuels and emission allowances and credits 
our future earnings will be affected by the strength or weakness of the wholesale power market 
the market has suffered a substantial reduction in overall liquidity because there are fewer creditworthy counterparties and because several key participants have exited the market or scaled back their activities 
based on the erosion in the market and on the market outlook  we currently expect contributions from our trading activities to be negligible for  and approximately million pretax annually thereafter 
generation construction program see liquidity and capital resources pinnacle west energy for information regarding pinnacle west energy s generation construction program  which is nearing completion 
the additional generation is expected to increase revenues  fuel expenses  operating expenses and financing costs 
factors affecting operating revenues general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states 
these revenues are expected to be affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix  customer growth and average usage per customer as well as electricity prices and variations in weather from period to period 
competitive sales of energy and energy related products and services are made by aps energy services in western states that have opened to competitive supply 
customer growth customer growth in aps service territory averaged about a year for the three years through  we currently expect customer growth to average about per year from to we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will grow on average  from through  before the retail effects of weather variations 
the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies to native load customers 
customer growth for the year ended december  compared with the prior year period was 
retail rate changes as part of the settlement agreement  aps agreed to a series of annual retail electricity price reductions of on july for each of the years to for a total of 
the final price reduction was implemented july  see settlement agreement in note for further information 
in addition  the company has requested a retail rate increase to be effective july  see aps general rate case and retail rate adjustment mechanisms in note for further information 
other factors affecting future financial results purchased power and fuel costs purchased power and fuel costs are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service and our hedging program for managing such costs 
see natural gas supply in note for more information on fuel costs 
operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth  power plant additions and operations  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to existing utility plant and other property  changes in regulatory asset amortization and our generation construction program 
west phoenix unit was placed in service in june redhawk units and and the new saguaro unit began commercial operations in july west phoenix unit was placed in service in july and silverhawk is expected to be in service in mid the regulatory assets to be recovered under the settlement agreement are currently being amortized as follows dollars in millions total property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by tax rates and the value of property in service and under construction 
the average property tax rate for aps  which currently owns the majority of our property  was of assessed value for and for we expect property taxes to increase primarily due to our generation construction program  as the plants phase in to the property tax base over a five year period  and our additions to existing facilities 
interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt 
the primary factors affecting borrowing levels in the next several years are expected to be our capital requirements and our internally generated cash flow 
capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction 
we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 
as noted above  we placed new power plants in commercial operation in  and and we expect to bring an additional plant on line in interest expense is also affected by interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rates on the refinancing of the company s future liquidity needs 
in addition  see note for a discussion of afudc 
retail competition the regulatory developments and legal challenges to the rules discussed in note have raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of retail electric competition and of electric restructuring in arizona 
although some very limited retail competition existed in aps service area in and  there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps customers 
as a result  we cannot predict when  and the extent to which  additional competitors will re enter aps service territory 
subsidiaries in the case of suncor  efforts to accelerate asset sales activities in were successful 
a portion of these sales have been  and additional amounts may be required to be  reported as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of income 
the annual earnings contribution from suncor was million after tax in see note for further discussion 
we anticipate suncor s annual earnings contributions in and will be in the million range after tax 
the annual earnings contribution from aps energy services is expected to be positive over the next several years due primarily to a number of retail electricity contracts in california 
aps energy services had after tax earnings of million in we expect suncor and aps energy services to have combined earnings of approximately million per year after tax beyond el dorado s historical results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for el dorado 
in addition  we do not currently expect material losses related to nac in the future 
general our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors 
see forward looking statements below for further information on such factors  which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate 
market risks our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and investments held by the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and our pension plans 
interest rate and equity risk our major financial market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable rate debt and interest earned by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate debt 
on january   we entered into a fixed for floating interest rate swap transaction see note for additional information 
the nuclear decommissioning fund also has risk associated with changing market values of equity investments 
nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

variable rate fixed rate short term debt long term debt long term debt interest interest interest rates amount rates amount rates amount years thereafter total fair value commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas  coal and emissions allowances 
we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options and swaps 
our ermc  consisting of officers and key management personnel  oversees company wide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies 
as part of our risk management program  we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity  fuels and emissions allowances and credits 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities 
in addition  subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ermc  we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements 
the mark to market value of derivative instruments related to our risk management and trading activities are presented in two categories consistent with our business segments regulated electricity non trading derivative instruments that hedge our purchases and sales of electricity and fuel for aps native load requirements of our regulated electricity business segment  and marketing and trading non trading and trading derivative instruments of our competitive business segment

credit risk we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties 
we have risk management and trading contracts with many counterparties  including two counterparties for which a worst case exposure represents approximately of our million of risk management and trading assets as of december  see note  mark to market accounting for a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy
