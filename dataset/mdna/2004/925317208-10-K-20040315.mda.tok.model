factors that could affect the company s future operating results and cause actual results to vary from expectations include  but are not limited to  lower than anticipated growth from existing customers  an inability to attract new customers  an inability to successfully integrate acquisitions and technology changes  or a decline in the financial stability of the company s customers 
negative developments in these or other risk factors could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
a summary of the company s critical accounting policies follows allowance for doubtful accounts the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
considerable judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the creditworthiness of each customer 
the evaluation is based on credit information and collection history concerning the customer up and through the determination date 
the company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific review of outstanding customer balances and a general reserve based upon the aging of customer accounts and write off history 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in recent periods and may occur in the future due to the current telecommunications and general economic environments and updates to the customer credit information and collection activity 
inventory obsolescence the company is required to state its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company makes judgments as to future demand requirements and compares that with the current and committed inventory levels 
the company has recorded changes in net realizable values in recent periods due to impact of current and future technology trends and changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines  as well as  changes in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements 
estimates of the future demand for the inventory are based on sales projections for different products  as well as estimates of inventory required to fulfill maintenance requirements for products previously sold

as of december   the company had a remaining reserve balance of approximately million  which is included in liabilities of discontinued operations 
the company currently believes that this remaining estimated balance is appropriate to cover future obligations associated with the restructurings  however  changes in these estimates could occur based on changes in the financial condition of the sublessees 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessment 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is principally dependant upon achievement of projected future taxable income 
the company s estimates regarding future profitability may change due to market conditions  its ability to continue to successfully execute its strategic plan and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to recognize the entire tax benefit  the company established an offsetting provision for the tax assets 
litigation and related contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product and other matters 
the company assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as  potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made by the company with assistance of its legal counsel after careful analysis of each individual issue based upon the then current facts and circumstances and discussions with legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters

in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset

r and has not yet completed its analysis 
risk factors the price of the common stock has been volatile 
the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  has recently experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
from january  to september   the per share closing price of the common stock on the nasdaq national market fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
from september  to february   the per share closing price of the common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
the company believes that the volatility of the price of the common stock does not solely relate to the company s performance and is broadly consistent with volatility experienced in the company s industry 
fluctuations may result from  among other reasons  responses to operating results  announcements by competitors  regulatory changes  economic changes  market valuation of technology firms and general market conditions 
in addition  in order to respond to competitive developments  the company may from time to time make pricing  service or marketing decisions that could harm its business 
also  the company s operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in either case  the trading price of the common stock would likely decline 
the trading price of the common stock could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to these or other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
if the market price of the common stock decreases  then shareholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock at a profit 
the company may be unable to fund future growth 
the company s business strategy calls for growth internally as well as through acquisitions 
to this end  the company has determined to invest substantial funds to increase its sales and marketing resources in order to grow revenues 
this strategy to increase sales and marketing resources as well as other strategies for growth internally which the company may implement now or in the future will require funding for additional personnel  capital expenditures and other expenses  as well as for working capital purposes 
financing may not be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  then the company may not be able to meet its business objectives for expansion 
this  in turn  could harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if the company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  then the percentage ownership of the company s shareholders will be reduced  and any new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of the common stock 
furthermore  if the company raises capital or acquires businesses by incurring indebtedness  then the company will become subject to the risks associated with indebtedness  including interest rate fluctuations and any financial or other covenants that the company s lender may require 
moreover  if the company s strategy to increase its sales and marketing resources in order to grow revenues does not produce the desired result  then the company will have incurred significant expenses for which it may or may not have obtained adequate funding to cover 
the company has a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future 
the company has a history of net losses  including net losses of million for the fiscal year  million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
further  developing the company s business strategy and expanding the company s services will require significant additional capital and other expenditures 
accordingly  if the company is not able to increase its revenue  then it may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability 
a decline in the price of the common stock could result in the delisting of the common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market 
the common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the company must satisfy certain minimum listing maintenance requirements to maintain such quotation  including a series of financial tests relating to net tangible assets  public float  number of market makers and shareholders  market capitalization  and maintaining a minimum bid price of per share for the common stock 
in the past  the company has had difficulty maintaining the minimum bid price for the common stock 
prior to september   the common stock was listed on the nasdaq national market 
on june   nasdaq notified the company that the bid price of the common stock had closed at less than per share over the previous consecutive trading days  and  as a result  the company did not comply with the minimum bid price continued listing requirement of the nasdaq national market 
the company was unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of the nasdaq national market  and on september   the company transferred the common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market 
in june  the company regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of the nasdaq smallcap market 
if the bid price of the common stock were to remain below per share for consecutive trading days  or if the company was unable to continue to meet the nasdaq small cap market s other listing standards  then nasdaq would notify the company that the common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
if the common stock is delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  then the common stock may trade on the over the counter bulletin board  which is viewed by most investors as a less desirable and less liquid market place 
delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market could make trading the common stock more difficult for the company s investors  leading to declines in share price 
delisting of the common stock would also make it more difficult and expensive for the company to raise additional capital 
furthermore  delisting of the common stock is an event of default under the company s credit facility with silicon valley bank  its outstanding convertible debentures and  through certain cross default provisions  the loan and security agreement the company entered into with clarent corporation in connection with the company s acquisition of substantially all of the business assets  and certain related liabilities  of clarent corporation on february  the company s growth could be limited if it is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the company announced plans in february to significantly and quickly increase sales and marketing personnel in order to grow revenue 
the company believes that its success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for highly skilled engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel is intense because there is a limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and an understanding of the markets which the company serves 
workforce reductions by the company during  and may adversely affect the company s ability to retain its current employees and recruit new employees 
the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could hinder the company s ability to implement its business strategy and harm its business 
the company is exposed to the general condition of the telecommunications market 
the company s business is subject to global economic conditions  and in particular  market conditions in the telecommunications industry 
the company s operations could be adversely affected if declines in capital spending from telecommunications service providers continue 
if global economic conditions worsen  or if the prolonged slowdown in the telecommunications industry continues  then the company may experience adverse operating results 
the company s need to invest in research and development could harm the company s operating results 
the company s industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if the company fails to invest sufficiently in research and development  then the company s products could become less attractive to potential customers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the company s need to maintain or increase its spending levels in this area  the company s operating results could be materially harmed if the company s net sales fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of the need for research and development and technological innovation  the company s operating costs may increase in the future 
the market for converged communications solutions is still in its infancy and rapidly evolving 
if this market does not develop and grow as expected  then it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
while the company believes there is a significant growth opportunity in providing converged communications solutions to its customers  there can be no assurances that this technology will be widely accepted or that a viable market for the company s products will fully develop or be sustainable 
if this market does not develop  or develops more slowly than expected  then the company may not be able to sell its products in significant volume  or at all 
due to the intense competition in this market and the recent introduction of this technology  there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in this evolving marketplace 
intellectual property infringement claims against the company  even without merit  could require the company to enter into costly licenses or deprive the company of the technology it needs 
the company s industry is technology intensive 
as the number of competitors in the company s target markets increases and the functionality of the products produced by such competitors further overlaps  third parties may claim that the technology the company develops or licenses infringes their proprietary rights 
any claims against the company or any of its subsidiaries may affect the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions 
any infringement claims  even those without merit  could require the company to pay damages or settlement amounts or could require the company to develop non infringing technology or enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements to avoid service implementation delays 
any litigation or potential litigation could result in product delays  increased costs or both 
in addition  the cost of litigation and the resulting distraction of the company s management resources could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
if successful  a claim of product infringement could deprive the company of the technology it needs altogether 
failure to protect the company s intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s success depends in part upon the protection of the company s proprietary application software and hardware products 
the company has taken steps that it believes are adequate to establish  protect and enforce its intellectual property rights 
the company cannot assure you that these efforts will be adequate 
despite the company s efforts to protect the company s proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain rights to use the company s products or technology 
the company has pending several patent applications related to its voip products  system architecture for internet telephone  interaction of voip calls and cellular networks  real time addition of devices to subscriber accounting  and system and method applications for electronic transaction settlement and dynamic changes error correction 
there can be no assurance that these patents will be issued 
even if these patents are issued  the limited legal protection afforded by patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws may not be sufficient to protect the company s proprietary rights to the intellectual property covered by these patents 
furthermore  the laws of many foreign countries in which the company does business do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the united states 
although the company has implemented and will continue to implement protective measures in those countries  these efforts may also not be successful 
additionally  even if the company s domestic and international efforts are successful  the company s competitors may independently develop non infringing technologies that are substantially similar or superior to the company s technologies 
if the company s products contain defects  then the company s sales are likely to suffer  and the company may be exposed to legal claims 
the company s business strategy calls for the development of new products and product enhancements which may from time to time contain defects or result in failures that the company did not detect or anticipate when introducing such products or enhancements to the market 
in addition  the markets in which the company s products are used are characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations and by errors  failures and bugs in third party platforms that can impede proper operation of the company s products 
despite product testing by the company  defects may still be discovered in some new products or enhancements after the products or enhancements are delivered to customers 
the occurrence of these defects could result in product returns  adverse publicity  loss of or delays in market acceptance of the company s products  delays or cessation of service to the company s customers or legal claims by customers against the company 
to the extent that contractual provisions that limit the company s exposure to legal claims are unenforceable or such claims are not covered by insurance  a successful products liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may be obligated to indemnify customers who purchase or lease equipment from the company against claims of patent infringement 
in the course of the company s business  the company may sell or lease certain equipment to its customers  and in connection with such sale or lease  may agree to indemnify these customers from claims made against them by third parties for patent infringement related to such equipment 
if the company is required to make any payments in respect of these indemnification obligations  then it could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the new softswitch and voip routers which the company intends to offer may not achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
as a result of the company s acquisition of substantially all of the operating assets of clarent corporation in february  the company now offers products which it could not offer previously  including class softswitch products and enterprise voip routers 
the markets for these products are relatively new  unpredictable and evolving rapidly 
lack of acceptance in the marketplace for these new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales to customers based outside the united states have recently accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenues  which exposes the company to risks inherent in international operations 
international sales represented of the company s revenues for the year ended december  furthermore  the company expects sales to international markets to increase as a percentage of revenues in the future 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations  laws  and communications standards  export license requirements  currency fluctuations  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulty in managing across disparate geographic areas  difficulties in hiring qualified local personnel  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  expenses associated with localizing products for foreign markets  and political and economic instability  including disruptions of cash flow and normal business operations that may result from terrorist attacks or armed conflict 
if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of the company s foreign customers should increase  then the resulting effective price increase of the company s products to these foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
in addition  to the extent that general economic downturns impact the company s customers  the ability of these customers to purchase the company s products could be adversely affected 
payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
the foreign markets for the company s products may develop more slowly than currently anticipated 
also  the company s ability to expand the sale of certain of its products internationally is limited by the necessity of obtaining regulatory approval in new countries 
the company anticipates that its non canadian  foreign sales will generally be invoiced in us dollars  and does not currently plan to engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
as the company expands its international operations  however  it may allow payment in foreign currencies  and exposure to losses in foreign currency transactions may increase 
the company may choose to limit any currency exposure through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or other hedging strategies 
the company s future currency hedging strategies may not be successful 
the company may become subject to certain patent infringement claims with respect to certain assets and technology the company purchased from clarent corporation 
in february  the company purchased from clarent corporation certain assets and technology  including a certain product  a component of which has been the subject of patent infringement claims made against clarent corporation 
if such patent infringement claims are made against the company in the future  even if such claims do not have merit  then the company could be required to pay damages or settlement amounts or could be required to develop non infringing technology or enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
any litigation could result in increased product costs  service delays or both 
if successful  a claim of product infringement could deprive the company of the assets and technology related to this product 
the company s dependence on contract manufacturers and suppliers could result in product delivery delays 
the company currently uses contract manufacturers to manufacture a significant portion of its products 
the company s reliance on contract manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in access to necessary manufacturing processes and reduced control over delivery schedules 
if the company s manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing the company s products and components in required volumes  then the company will have to identify one or more acceptable alternative manufacturers 
furthermore  the use of new manufacturers may cause significant interruptions in supply if the new manufacturers have difficulty manufacturing products to the company s specifications 
further  the introduction of new manufacturers may increase the variance in the quality of the company s products 
in addition  the company relies upon third party suppliers of specialty components and intellectual property used in its products 
it is possible that a component needed to complete the manufacture of the company s products may not be available at acceptable prices or on a timely basis  if at all 
inadequate supplies of components  or the loss of intellectual property rights  could affect the company s ability to deliver products to its customers 
any significant interruption in the supply of the company s products would result in the reduction of product sales to customers  which in turn could permanently harm the company s reputation in the industry 
the company may be subject to litigation 
the company may be subject to claims involving how the company conducts its business or the market for or issuance of the common stock or other securities 
any such claims against the company may affect its business  results of operations and financial conditions 
such claims  including those without merit  could require the company to pay damages or settlement amounts and would require a substantial amount of time and attention from the company s senior management as well as considerable legal expenses 
although the company does not anticipate that its activities would warrant such claims  there can be no assurances that such claims will not be made 
the company may be unable to successfully integrate its operations with the operations of mck 
the company s acquisition of mck in september by means of a merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently 
the challenges of combining the companies operations include integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds  combining different corporate cultures and managing a geographically dispersed organization 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the combined company s businesses and the loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition of the combined company 
the company derives a substantial amount of its revenues from channel distribution partners and such revenues may decline significantly if any major partner cancels or delays a purchase of its products 
the company uses an indirect sales model to derive a substantial portion of its revenue 
failure to generate revenue as expected from this channel could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
no channel partner or distributor is obligated to purchase additional products or services from the company 
accordingly  present and future partners may terminate their purchasing arrangements with the company or significantly reduce or delay their orders 
any termination  change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company currently has varying distribution  marketing and development arrangements with its partners 
there is no assurance that the company will continue to enjoy the support and cooperation that it has historically experienced from these parties or their associated distribution channels 
also  there is no certainty that these parties will continue to offer the company s products in their sales portfolio 
it is possible that these vendors may seek to offer broader product lines and solutions that are competitive with the company s products 
in addition  they may change their distribution models which could negatively impact revenues of the company 
furthermore  the company must correctly anticipate the price  performance and functionality requirements of these partners and must successfully develop products that meet end user requirements and make these products available on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities in order to sustain and grow its business 
the company s inability to develop and maintain relationships with key technology suppliers could harm its ability to sustain and grow its business 
the success of the company depends to a significant degree upon its continued relationships with leading technology suppliers 
the standards for telephony equipment and data networks are evolving  and the company s products may not be compatible with new technology standards that may emerge 
if the company is unable to provide its customers with interoperable solutions  then they may make purchases from vendors who provide the requisite product interoperability 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has also not entered into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates although the company may enter into such transactions in the future 
interest rate risks the company s notes payable and convertible subordinated debentures at december   carry interest rates which are fixed 
the company s line of credit with silicon valley bank carries interest rates which vary with the prime rate 
accordingly  if the company has any indebtedness outstanding under its line of credit with silicon valley bank  then any increases in silicon valley bank s prime rate will reduce the company s earnings 
at december   the company did not have any indebtedness outstanding under its line of credit with silicon valley bank 
foreign currency risks products sold outside of the united states of america are transacted in us dollars and  therefore  the company is not exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
transactions with clarent canada present foreign currency exchange risk 
the principal transactions are personnel and related costs 
the intercompany balance is denominated in us dollars and changes in foreign currency rates would result in foreign currency gains and losses 
using the intercompany balance at december   a strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately  to date  foreign exchange gains and losses have not been significant
