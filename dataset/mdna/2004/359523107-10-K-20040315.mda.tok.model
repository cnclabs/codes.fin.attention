item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech nv fuel tech operates primarily in the air pollution control business 
it distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
principal markets for its products are stationary combustion sources that produce nitrogen oxide nox and other emissions 
fuel tech sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
fuel tech currently generates revenues from the following three product lines nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies fuel tech markets several nox reduction technologies to meet statutory nox reduction requirements worldwide 
the near term driver for growth in this business is the ozone transport sip state implementation plan call  which requires states to decrease their nox emissions by may  this regulation impacts utility boilers and large industrial boilers see below for more detail on the sip call 
fuel tech believes that the implementation of the sip call will extend well beyond the may  implementation date 
fuel treatment chemicals fuel tech s proprietary targeted in furnace injection tifi technology centers on the unique application of specialty chemicals to improve the performance of combustion units 
specifically  this technology is used to reduce slag formation  corrosion and opacity in boilers  furnaces and incinerators 
fuel tech believes its largest market opportunity for this product line is those units burning western coals  many of which have significant operational issues related to the formation of slag 
visualization software in  fuel tech introduced a software product  marketed under the acuitiv trade name  which allows users to visualize complex data sets in a three dimensional immersive environment 
the software is currently being marketed to users of computation fluid dynamics cfd software  an engineering software tool that aids users in predicting flows  such as liquid or gas streams 
fuel tech developed this software internally to make the design process of its nox reduction and fuel treatment chemical business more efficient and accurate 
fuel tech licenses this product to end users on an annual or permanent basis 
fuel tech will not record license revenue until its capitalized software development costs  with a balance of approximately  at december   are recovered 
this product was introduced in mid  and to date five licenses have been sold 
fuel tech expects demand for this product to increase in as a version with increased functionality will be delivered during the first half of the year 
fuel tech does not believe  however  that it will recognize significant revenues in from this product due to the cost recovery requirement discussed above 
versus net sales for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the improvement is primarily attributable to the increase in fuel treatment chemical revenues  as this product line contributed revenues at a record level during revenues derived from western coal fired utility boilers had the largest year on year impact  and positive contributions were attained from utilities burning oil  both in the united states and in foreign locations 
fuel tech believes that its success on several western coal fired utility boilers  along with intensely focused sales and marketing efforts and the utilization of strategic partners  will lead to further penetration of the western coal fired utility market in the near future 
this market represents the largest market opportunity for the fuel treatment chemical business and penetration into this market is a priority 
the company s tifi technology alleviates the slagging and fouling issues associated with burning coals that are high in low melting point ash constituents  such as sodium 
fuel tech has received two additional orders for demonstrations on coal fired boilers in  and additional orders are expected 
nox reduction project revenues in were at approximately the same level as even with the environmental protection agency s epa sip state implementation plan call regulation in place  two factors led to a slowing of equipment orders in the air pollution control business in the latter part of the year 
first  recent rulings related to new source review have caused our utility customers to reassess their sip call compliance plans to ensure that they will meet their overall nox reduction requirements in the most cost effective manner 
although the company expects this recent ruling to benefit business in the future  the impact in the near term is a delay in the receipt of orders 
second  many utilities are experiencing significant capital constraints 
this  coupled with depressed nox allowance prices for  which are the result of weak demand for power and the existence of a shortened ozone season  has caused some utilities to delay capital spending and to meet their requirements on a short term basis through the purchase of allowances and other temporary means 
based on these market factors  the air pollution control business did weaken during the latter portion of  and is expected to remain weak during the first half of it is expected that the second half of will start to show improvement  with increased strength in and fuel tech continues to work cooperatively with critical customers as they look to finalize their compliance plans 
the sip call  introduced in  is the federal mandate that required states to reduce nox emissions by may on march   an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of the sip call for of the states and  on june   the same court made a final ruling upholding the epa s sip call regulation and denying the appeal of the states and utilities 
although the nox reduction requirement date was moved back one year to may   states were required to complete and issue their state implementation plans for nox reduction by october of these plans  which the epa had until october to approve  will potentially impact to utility boilers and to industrial units 
although the sip call was the subject of litigation  an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of this regulation 
this court s ruling was later affirmed by the us supreme court 
in february  the us supreme court  in a unanimous decision  upheld epa s authority to revise the national ambient air quality standard for ozone to parts per million averaged through an eight hour period from the current parts per million for a one hour period 
this more stringent standard provides clarity and impetus for air pollution control efforts well beyond the current ozone attainment requirement of in keeping with this trend  the supreme court  only days later  denied industry s attempt to stay the sip call  effectively exhausting all means of appeal 
on december   epa proposed a new regulation that affects the sip call states by calling for more nox reductions in and also  deep nox reductions are called for in additional states outside the current sip call region 
the proposed rule  called the interstate air quality rule  allows a cap and trade format similar to the sip call 
based on these regulatory developments  fuel tech expects to enjoy continued demand for its air pollution technologies over the next several years 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  for the month period ended december   was versus for the same period of the prior year 
this increase reflects a change in product mix within the nox reduction project business 
a significantly larger percentage of the revenues for were generated by turnkey projects versus the comparable period in when the company is responsible for the turnkey installation of the equipment as part of the project scope  the overall project margin becomes diluted 
the installation scope for a project carries a significantly lower margin than the company s traditional scope 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  respectively  for the month periods ended december  and the increase is due primarily to the addition of sales and marketing resources for the fuel treatment chemical business 
market penetration of fuel tech s tifi technology in the coal fired utility market remains a strategic priority 
research and development expenses for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
fuel tech continues to pursue commercial applications for technologies related to its core businesses  with a particular focus on its fuel chem  noxout ultra and acuitiv technologies 
interest expense for the months ended december  was reduced to  from  in the prior month period 
in the second quarter of the year  the company paid off the entirety of its outstanding debt balance 
other income and expense for the month period ended december  was  versus  for the same period in no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded during the month period ended december  due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in  which represented a reduction of the reserve for prior years state income tax refunds receivable  as the related receivables were collected in fuel tech has million in us federal income tax loss carryforwards as of december   the deferred tax benefit of which has been offset by a valuation allowance in fuel tech s balance sheet 
in the opinion of management  fuel tech s expected near term revenue growth will be driven by the timing of the penetration of the coal fired utility marketplace via utilization of its tifi technology  and by various entity s implementation of the nox reduction requirements of the caaa 
versus net sales for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the improvement was attributable to the increase in domestic nox reduction utility project revenues  as project bookings in the fourth quarter of and in generated revenues during their various phases of completion 
nox reduction utility revenue in had been negatively impacted by the delay in obtaining a final ruling on the environmental protection agency s epa sip state implementation plan call regulation 
as discussed further below  the uncertainty regarding this regulation has been lifted and fuel tech expects demand for its nox reduction technologies to continue to increase during the next few years 
fuel treatment chemical revenues for the month period ended december  continued to be favorably impacted by shipments to utilities burning western coals 
fuel tech believes that utilities burning western coals represent the largest market opportunity for its fuel treatment chemical business and that penetration into this market is a priority 
in addition to shipments to pacificorp  fuel tech s strategic agreement partner  demonstrations with two midwestern utilities  both on coal fired units  commenced during the year 
all of these utilities are using fuel tech s patented targeted in furnace injection tifi process to control the formation of slag deposits in boilers burning western coals 
more than offsetting the improved performance in the coal fired utility segment of this market were the following two factors first  the continued deterioration in the oil fired business  as the high price of oil as compared with the price of natural gas caused customers in this segment to switch fuels  negatively impacting results 
second  the use of low slagging coal by one of fuel tech s customers caused that customer to temporarily suspend treatment 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  for the month period ended december  was versus for the same period of the prior year 
the increase reflects a change in product mix in  in favor of the lower margin nox reduction project business 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  respectively  for the month periods ended december  and the increase was due primarily to revenue related expenses  as revenue increased significantly from the prior year  and secondarily to the addition of sales and marketing personnel  both for the fuel treatment chemical and acuitiv businesses 
research and development expenses for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
fuel tech continues to pursue commercial applications for its technologies outside of its traditional markets  with a particular focus on its acuitiv software and its noxout ultra process 
the acuitiv software product was commercially introduced on june  fuel tech recorded a loss of  for the months ended december  on its equity investment in fuel tech cs gmbh ftcs  a owned entity  which served to reduce the investment value to zero 
during the quarter ended march   fuel tech recognized a gain of  on its equity investment in clean diesel technologies  inc cdt  its owned affiliate 
the gain resulted from cdt s repayment of the full principal amount of loans made by fuel tech to cdt in and because of the continuing losses incurred by cdt  the carrying value of the loans was reduced to zero as of december   based on fuel tech s pro rata share of the losses incurred 
during the months ended december   fuel tech recognized a  loss on its equity investment in ftcs  while a loss of  was recorded on fuel tech s investment in cdt for the same period 
interest expense for the months ended december  was reduced to  from  in the prior month period 
the decrease is attributable to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance on fuel tech s term loan  as well as to a reduction in short term interest rates 
other income and expense for the month period ended december  was  versus  for the same period in the increase stems largely from the elimination of goodwill amortization effective january   which has been offset somewhat by reductions in interest income 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in  which represented a reduction of the reserve for prior years state income tax refunds receivable  as the related receivables were collected in no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded in any period due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
fuel tech had million in us federal income tax loss carryforwards as of december   the deferred tax benefit of which has been offset by a valuation allowance in fuel tech s balance sheet 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   fuel tech had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  versus  and  at the end of operating activities provided  of cash in primarily due to fuel tech s operating profits 
investing activities  which used cash of  during the year  were comprised of the continued investment in equipment and intellectual property of  and by the acquisition of a fuel additive business for  financing activities used cash of  during the year 
fuel tech repaid its outstanding debt balance of  during the year and purchased  for   of its common shares for retirement 
lastly  fuel tech generated cash from the exercise of stock options in the amount of  fuel tech  inc fti has a million revolving credit facility expiring july   which is collateralized by all personal property owned by fti 
fti can use this facility for cash advances and standby letters of credit 
cash advances under this facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate  or at an optional rate that can be selected by fti which is based on the bank s interbank offering rate plus 
the million revolving credit facility was obtained via an amendment  effective december   that increased the credit facility from million to million and extended the agreement until july  also  fti had a term loan agreement with the same bank for a total principal balance of million 
the principal balance was to be repaid in quarterly installments of  commencing on december   with a final principal payment of  due on january  the term loan was paid in full on january  at december   the bank had provided standby letters of credit  predominantly to customers  totaling approximately  in connection with contracts in process 
fti is committed to reimbursing the issuing bank for any payments made by the bank under these letters of credit 
at december   there were no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately  was available for utilization 
interest payments were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fuel tech believes that it will have sufficient resources to fund its growth and operations going forward 
contractual obligations and commitments in its normal course of business  fuel tech enters into agreements that obligate fuel tech to make future payments 
the operating lease obligations noted below are primarily related to supporting the normal operations of the business and are not recognized as liabilities in fuel tech s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by period in thousands of us dollars contractual cash less than obligations total year years years thereafter operating leases  total contractual cash obligations  fuel tech  in the normal course of business  uses bank performance guarantees and letters of credit in support of construction contracts with customers as follows in support of the warrantee period defined in the contract  or in support of the system performance criteria that are defined in the contract in addition  fuel tech uses letters of credit as security for other obligations as needed in the normal course of business 
as of december   fuel tech has outstanding bank performance guarantees and letters of credit as noted in the table below commitment expiration by period in thousands of us dollars less than commercial commitments total year years years thereafter standby letters of credit and bank guarantees critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require fuel tech to make estimates and assumptions 
fuel tech believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain long term equipment construction and license contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual engineering hours and equipment construction costs incurred and total estimated hours and costs at completion 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contract  recognized sales and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
forward looking information from time to time  information provided by fuel tech  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report may contain statements that are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of fuel tech s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  product demand  pricing  market acceptance  litigation  risk of dependence on significant customers  third party suppliers and intellectual property rights  risks in product and technology development and other risk factors detailed in this annual report and in fuel tech s securities and exchange commission filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fuel tech s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fuel tech does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts or into foreign currency option contracts to manage this risk due to the immaterial nature of the transactions involved 
fuel tech is also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to its long term debt arrangement refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not have a materially adverse effect on interest expense during the upcoming year ended december
