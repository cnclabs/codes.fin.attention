overview in august  we completed the sale of our network diagnostics division ndd to catapult communications corporation catapult for million  consisting of million in cash and convertible subordinated promissory notes issued by catapult s wholly owned irish subsidiary and guaranteed by catapult in the total amount of million  subject to certain adjustments 
the sale of ndd resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million million after income taxes and was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly our historical financial results have been revised to reflect ndd as a discontinued operation 
in june  we acquired a controlling voting ownership interest on an as converted basis in santera in exchange for a cash contribution of million and the contribution of the business operations and certain assets and liabilities of tekelec s packet telephony business unit ptbu 
as part of the acquisition  santera was recapitalized and tekelec contributed the million in cash to santera in exchange for  shares of santera series b preferred stock 
in addition  tekelec received  shares of santera series a preferred stock and one share of santera s common stock in exchange for the ptbu 
santera s existing shareholders received  shares of series a preferred stock in exchange for their existing shares in santera and made an additional cash contribution to santera of million 
each share of santera series b preferred stock has a liquidation preference equal to  and is convertible into shares of santera s common stock 
each share of santera series a preferred stock has a liquidation preference equal to  and is convertible into one share of santera common stock 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the capital structure of santera has been eliminated in consolidation and the minority stockholders interest in santera is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as minority interest 
the minority stockholders interest in santera is reflected at the fair value of the santera assets on the date of acquisition 
santera develops  markets and sells solutions for carrier class  next generation switches 
on february   we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase taqua  inc  a privately held provider of next generation class packet switching systems  located in richardson  texas 
upon the closing of the transaction  we will purchase all of taqua s outstanding stock for approximately million cash  plus assume outstanding options 
the purchase is expected to close no later than april  pending united states anti trust approval and the completion of certain contractual requirements 
taqua s business will become part of our next generation switching business 
our product offerings are currently organized into three distinct product lines network signaling  contact center  and next generation switching 
network signaling formerly network systems 
our network signaling product line consists principally of the eagle sas and products  features and applications based on the eagle platform  including tekware and tekserver  our local number portability solution  sentinel  and other convergence products 
contact center 
our iex contact center products provide planning  management and call routing and control tools for single contact centers and for complex  multiple site contact center environments 
this product line includes the totalview workforce management and totalnet call routing solutions 

table of contents next generation switching 
santera s portfolio of switching solutions allows network service providers to migrate their network infrastructure from circuit based technology to packet based technology 
santera s product portfolio includes santeraone  a carrier grade  integrated voice and data switching solution which delivers applications like ixc tandem  class  pri offload  packet cell switching and voice over broadband services 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  estimates are evaluated  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  notes receivable  deferred taxes and impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  product warranty  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
revenues are derived from sales of network signaling products  contact center products and next generation switching products 
revenues are recognized upon the transfer of title  generally at the time of shipment to the customer s final site and satisfaction of related company obligations  if any  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is deemed probable 
for certain products  our sales arrangements include acceptance provisions which are based on our published specifications 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of these products assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  provided that we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria and has established a history with substantially similar transactions 
revenue is deferred for sales arrangements that include customer specific acceptance provisions where we are unable to reliably demonstrate that the delivered product meets all of the specified criteria until customer acceptance is obtained 
revenues associated with multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
revenues associated with installation services  if provided  are deferred based on the fair value of such services and are recognized upon completion 
revenue is recognized for maintenance agreements ratably over the contract term 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventory levels are based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can result in excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis inventories are reviewed and written down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimates could be influenced by sudden decline in demand due to economic downturn  rapid product improvements and technological changes 

table of contents investments 
our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are accounted for at their fair value  and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
among other things  we consider the duration and extent of the decline and economic factors influencing the markets 
to date  we have had no such other than temporary declines below cost basis 
at december  and  net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities were not significant 
we utilize specific identification in computing realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
realized gains and losses are reported in other income and expense  and were not significant for  and we also invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are classified as long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operations 
we periodically review these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value and write down investments to their fair value when an other than temporary decline has occurred 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based on several factors including  the values for recent rounds of financing  quoted market prices for comparable public companies or market values for recent acquisitions of similar private companies  and pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information 
to date  there have been no impairments of investments in privately held companies 
notes receivable 
notes receivable from catapult communications  inc related to our sale of the ndd business are reflected in the balance sheet at their estimated fair value determined with the assistance of a third party appraisal 
the fair value was computed by discounting the face value amount to present value using a fair value rate of interest and then determining the fair value of the conversion option using the black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of the notes is being adjusted for the amortization to the redemption amount at maturity 
see note c disposition of network diagnostics business 
deferred taxes 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have provided a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of santera  due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and realization of the benefits from santera s tax attributes in future tax returns 
realization of the remaining deferred tax assets of million is dependent on the extent of our income in carryback years and on our generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
should it be determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid to the fair value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  or ipr d 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identifiable intangible assets impact future amortization and the amounts assigned to ipr d are expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
instead  goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually thereafter 
in connection with our performance of the impairment tests  we obtained valuations of our individual reporting units from an independent third party valuation firm 
the valuation methodologies included  but were not limited to  estimated net present value of the projected cash flows of these reporting units 
as a result of these impairment tests  we determined that there was no goodwill impairment in or if actual results are 
table of contents substantially lower than our projections underlying these valuations  or if market discount rates increase  this could adversely affect our future valuations and result in future impairment charges 
we assess potential impairment of our finite lived  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is an impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using discounted estimated future cash flows 
the amount of an impairment would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
events or changes in circumstances which may cause an impairment include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
product warranty 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for one year after sale and provide for estimated future warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the revenues by geographic territory as a percentage of total revenues percentage of revenues for the years ended december  north america europe rest of world total compared with revenues 
our revenues increased by million  or  during due to the addition of sales from our next generation switching products partially offset with lower sales in both our network signaling and contact center operation segments 
revenues from network signaling products decreased by million  or  due primarily to lower sales of eagle stp products  partially offset by higher revenues from upgrades  extension sales and revenues from service agreements 
eagle stp product sales decreased in as a result of customers increasing the capacity of their existing stp nodes by purchasing extensions rather than initial systems 
revenues from contact center products decreased by million  or  primarily as a result of decreased sales of the totalview product 
the decrease in the revenues was attributable primarily to a reduction in information technology capital spending and increasing competition in the industry 
revenues from next generation switching products for were million  reflecting the addition of sales of next generation products following the june acquisition of a majority interest in santera 
see note b acquisition of majority interest in santera revenues in north america increased by million  or  due primarily to increased revenues from upgrades  extension sales and revenues from service agreements 
revenues in europe decreased by million  or  due primarily to weaker sales of eagle stp products 
rest of world revenues increased by million or due primarily to higher sales of eagle stp products 
we believe that our future revenue growth depends in large part upon a number of factors  including the continued market acceptance  both domestically and internationally  of our products  particularly the eagle products and related applications as well as our suite of products for converged circuit and packet networks 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared with in the increase in gross margins was due primarily to a higher proportion of sales of eagle stp upgrades and extensions and service agreements  which typically carry higher margins 
changes in the following factors  among others  may affect gross profit product and distribution channel mix  competition  customer discounts  supply and demand conditions in the electronic components industry  internal manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies  foreign currency fluctuations  pricing pressure as we expand internationally  and general economic conditions 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased overall by million  or  and increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in these increases were due primarily to an increase in salary and related expenses attributable to the hiring of additional personnel and our acquisition of a majority interest in santera see note b acquisition of a majority interest in santera 
we intend to continue to make substantial investments in product and technology development  and we believe that our future success depends in a large part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and to develop or acquire new products that maintain our technological competitiveness 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  and increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the increases were due primarily to our acquisition of a majority interest in santera see note b acquisition of a majority interest in santera and secondarily to an increase in facility costs and consulting services related to santera integration activities 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development expense iprd of million in represents the write off in the second quarter of acquired in process research and development related to the santera acquisition 
iprd was valued using a discounted cash flow approach commonly known as the excess earnings approach 
see note b acquisition of majority interest in santera 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets in increased by  to million 
this increase was due to the increase in intangible assets related to our acquisition of a majority interest in santera see note b acquisition of a majority interest in santera 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest expense decreased by  or  due primarily to the june issuance of our new convertible debt which carries an interest rate of compared to the former convertible debt interest rate of 
the former convertible debt was redeemed in july interest income decreased to  or  due to lower interest rates in compared to provision for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes for and were million and million  respectively  and reflected the effect of non deductible acquisition related costs and amortization  partially offset by a benefit of million and million  respectively  from the utilization of deferred tax liabilities related to certain of these acquisition related costs 
our provision for income taxes does not include any benefit from the losses generated by santera due to the following santera s losses cannot be included on our consolidated federal tax return because our ownership interest in santera does not meet the threshold to consolidate under income tax rules and regulations  and a full valuation allowance has been established against santera s deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and realization of the benefits from santera s tax attributes in future tax returns 
our effective tax rate was for and for and includes in and in relating to acquisition related items and the results of santera in excluding the effect of these acquisition related items and the operating results of santera  our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively and represented federal  state and foreign taxes on our income  reduced primarily by research and development credits  foreign tax credits and other benefits from foreign sourced income 
we expect that our effective tax rate  excluding the effect of acquisition related items and the operating results of santera  will remain relatively consistent with and within the range of the effective tax rates in prior years 
changes in the tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of international sales and changes in the amount of the research and development and other credits 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the losses of santera allocable to santera s minority shareholders 
the net income and losses of santera are allocated between tekelec and the minority interest based on their relative interests in the equity of santera and the related liquidation preferences 
this approach requires net losses to be allocated first to the series a preferred stock until fully absorbed and then to the series b preferred stock 
subsequent net income will be allocated first to the series b preferred stock to the extent of previously recognized net losses allocated to series b preferred stock 
additional net income will then be allocated to the series a preferred stock to the extent of previously recognized losses allocated to series a preferred stock and then to common stock in proportion to their relative ownership interests in the equity of santera 
the loss allocated to minority interest of santera for the period of june  through december  was computed as follows dollars in thousands santera net loss includes amortization of intangibles and iprd charges of  and  respectively percentage of losses attributable to the minority interest based on capital structure and liquidation preferences net loss allocated to minority interest

we have a million line of credit with a us bank 
our million credit facility bears interest at or  in some cases  below the lender s prime rate at december  and expires on august   if not renewed 
under the terms of this credit facility  we are required to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain net worth and indebtedness covenants 
we believe we are in compliance with these requirements 
there have been no borrowings under this credit facility 
as a result of the santera transaction see note b acquisition of majority interest in santera  we have two notes payable to us financial institutions 
one of the notes has an outstanding balance of million and is secured by the assets purchased under the note  bears interest at and matures in february the second note for million is secured by the assets purchased under the note and substantially all of santera s assets  excluding the assets secured under the million note  bears interest at and matures in november under the terms of this facility  we are required to maintain certain financial reporting covenants 
we believe we are in compliance with these requirements 
on february   we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase taqua  inc  a privately held provider of next generation class packet switching systems 
upon the closing of this transaction  we will purchase all of taqua s outstanding stock  for approximately million cash  plus assume outstanding options 
the purchase is expected to close no later than april in november  we completed the private placement of million principal amount at maturity of convertible subordinated discounted notes due in  issued at of their face amount equivalent to gross proceeds of approximately million at issuance before discounts and expenses

table of contents common stock per  principal amount  subject to certain adjustments  on their final maturity 
there are no financial covenants related to the notes and there are no restrictions on us paying dividends  incurring debt or issuing or repurchasing securities 
we believe that existing working capital  funds generated through operations  and our current bank credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
nonetheless  we may seek additional sources of capital as necessary or appropriate to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations  however  there can be no assurance that such funds  if needed  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
less than more than total year years years years in thousands notes payable long term convertible debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations total from time to time in the normal course of business we may enter into purchasing agreements with our suppliers that require us to accept delivery of  and remit full payment for  finished products that we have ordered  finished products that we requested be held as safety stock  and work in process started on our behalf in the event we cancel or terminate the purchasing agreement 
it is not our intent  nor is it reasonable likely  that we would cancel a purchase order which we have executed 
because these agreements do not specify fixed or minimum quantities  do not specify minimum or variable price provisions  and do not specify the approximate timing of the transaction  we have no basis to estimate any future liability 
financial risk we conduct business in a number of foreign countries  with certain transactions denominated in local currencies 
in certain instances where we have entered into contracts that are denominated in foreign currencies  we have obtained foreign currency forward contracts  principally denominated in euros or british pounds  to offset the impact of currency rate fluctuations on accounts receivable 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recorded immediately in earnings 
as of december   we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to sell approximately  euros in order to hedge certain receivables denominated in that currency 
this contract had an expiration date of january  and did not meet specific hedge accounting requirements 
we had no forward or option contracts outstanding as of december  we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the purpose of our foreign currency management policy is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign denominated anticipated cash flows 
the terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged 
we may continue to use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risks in the future 

table of contents fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
the portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk 
there have been no borrowings under our variable rate credit facilities 
all of our outstanding long term debt is fixed rate and not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
with respect to trade receivables  we design  manufacture  market and support network signaling products and selected service applications for telecommunications networks and contact centers 
our customers include telecommunications carriers  network providers  and contact center operators 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition  and generally collateral is not required 
generally  payment terms stipulate payment within days of shipment and currently  we do not engage in leasing or other customer financing arrangements 
many of our international sales are secured with import insurance or letters of credit to mitigate credit risk 
although we have processes in place to monitor and mitigate credit risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in eliminating such risk 
historically  credit losses have been within management s expectations 
our exposure to credit risk has increased as a result of weakened financial conditions in certain market segments such as the competitive local exchange carrier segment 
credit losses for such customers have been provided for in the financial statements 
future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
