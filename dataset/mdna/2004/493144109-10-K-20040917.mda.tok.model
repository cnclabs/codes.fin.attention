although the company hopes to expand its ems business to include the european market  sales within europe currently are primarily of electronic keyboards 
key tronic computer peripheral co  ltd  the company s subsidiary in shanghai  china  has had only minimal sales to customers in china over the past three fiscal years 
capital resources and liquidity cash flows used in operating activities were  in fiscal year compared to  used in fiscal year and  of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year the cash used in operations during fiscal year was due primarily to an increase of million in accounts receivables and million in inventory but these were offset by an increase in operating liabilities of million

the table below sets forth the company s significant future obligations by fiscal year payments due by fiscal year in thousands total thereafter litigation settlement cit revolving loan capital and operating leases purchase orders for an in depth discussion of the litigation settlement  please see the consolidated financial statements at note  commitments and contingencies 
in accordance with the terms of the litigation settlement  the company must pay a minimum of  or fifty percent of its operating earnings each quarter whichever is greater 
if the entire remainder of the settlement is not paid by december  additional amounts must be paid 
because payments exceeding  depend entirely on the company s operating earnings  which are not readily determinable  the above table indicates the minimum payments for fiscal year  and the remaining amount owing after those payments is shown in fiscal year at this time  the company expects to pay the entire settlement amount by december the terms of the cit revolving loan are discussed in the consolidated financial statements at note  long term obligations 
the company s current financing agreement with cit terminates on august   at which time the unpaid balance of the revolving loan will become immediately payable 
however  the company will more likely than not extend or replace its revolving loan agreement prior to that date 
the amount payable on the company s revolving loan changes daily depending upon the amount of cash borrowed to support its operations and the amount of customer payments received 
under the terms of the company s agreement with cit  all customers payments are applied against the outstanding revolving loan balance as soon as the amounts clear through the banking system 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  the company must meet a number of financial covenants 
as of july  the company was in compliance with all of its loan covenants 
breaching one or more of these covenants could have a material impact on the company s operations or financial condition 
the company maintains vertically integrated manufacturing operations in mexico and shanghai  china 
such operations are heavily dependent upon technically superior manufacturing equipment including molding machines in various tonnages  smt lines  and automated insertion and test equipment for the various products the company is capable of producing 
in addition  the company leases most of its administrative and manufacturing facilities 
a complete discussion of properties can be found in part  item at properties 
leases have proven to be an acceptable method for the company to acquire new or replacement equipment and to maintain many facilities with a minimum impact on its operating cash flows 
as of july   the company had open purchase order commitments for materials and other supplies of approximately million 
of the million in open purchase orders  there are various blanket orders for annual requirements 
actual needs under these blanket purchase orders fluctuate with the company s manufacturing levels 
in addition  the company has contracts with its customers that minimize its exposure to losses for material purchased within lead times necessary to meet customer forecasts 
purchase orders generally can be cancelled without penalty within specified ranges that are determined in negotiations with the company s suppliers 
these agreements depend in part on the type of product purchased as well as the circumstances surrounding any requested cancellations 
in addition to the cash requirements presented in tabular format  the company also owes its suppliers approximately million for accounts payable and shipments in transit at the end of the fiscal year 
the company generally pays its suppliers in a range from to days depending on terms offered 
quarterly payments to suppliers normally average between and million 
these payments are financed by the company s revolving line of credit 
the company believes that funds available under the revolving credit facility and internally generated funds can satisfy cash requirements for a period in excess of months 

table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue primarily when products are shipped 
staff accounting bulletin states that revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured the company believes that it meets the above criteria for the following reasons customer purchase orders confirming the price and shipping terms are required prior to shipment 
the terms of the company s sales are generally fob shipping point  meaning that the customer takes ownership of the goods and assumes the risk of loss when the goods leave the company s premises 
the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable as noted  we require a customer purchase order  which confirms the price and shipping terms 
collectibility is reasonably assured the credit terms for customers are pre established so that collection of the account can be reasonably assured 
inactive  obsolete and surplus inventory reserve the company reserves for inventories that it deems inactive  obsolete or surplus 
this reserve is calculated based upon the demand for the products that the company produces 
demand is determined by expected sales or customer forecasts 
if expected sales do not materialize  then the company would have inventory in excess of its reserves and would have to charge the excess against future earnings 
in the case where the company has purchased material based upon a customer s forecast  the company is usually covered by lead time assurance agreements with each customer 
these contracts state that the financial liability for material purchased within lead time and based upon the customer s forecasts  lies with the customer 
if the company purchases material outside the lead time assurance agreement and the customer s forecasts do not materialize  the company would have the financial liability and would have to charge the excess against future earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company values its accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is based on estimates of the portion of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future  and the amount of this allowance is disclosed in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the estimates used are based primarily on specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
such accounts are identified using publicly available information in conjunction with evaluations of current payment activity 
however  if any of the company s customers were to develop unexpected and immediate financial problems that would prevent payment of open invoices  the company could incur additional and possibly material expenses that would negatively impact earnings 
accrued warranty an accrual is made for expected warranty costs  with the related expense recognized in cost of goods sold 
management reviews the adequacy of this accrual quarterly based on historical analysis and anticipated product returns 
over the course of the past three years  the company s warranty expense has decreased 
the declines in warranty expense and the related accrual account are directly related to the change in the composition of the company s revenue from keyboards to ems products 
as the company has made the transition from manufacturing primarily keyboards to primarily ems products  its exposure to warranty claims has declined significantly 
the company s warranty period for keyboards is generally longer than that for ems products 
also the company does not warrant design defects for ems customers

table of contents risks and uncertainties that could affect future results the following risks and uncertainties could affect the company s actual results and could cause results to differ materially from past results or those contemplated by the company s forward looking statements 
when used herein  the words expects  believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future due to a variety of factors  including changes in overall demand for customers products  success of customers programs  timing of new programs  new product introductions or technological advances by the company  its customers and its competitors and changes in pricing policies by the company  its customers  its suppliers and its competitors 
for example  the company relies on customers forecasts to plan its business 
if those forecasts are overly optimistic  the company s revenues and profits may fall short of expectations 
conversely  if those forecasts are too conservative  the company could have an unexpected increase in revenues and profits 
the products which the company manufactures for its customers have relatively short product lifecycles  therefore the company s business  operating results and financial condition are dependent in significant part on the company s ability to obtain orders from new customers and new product programs from existing customers 
competition the ems industry is intensely competitive 
competitors may offer customers lower prices on certain high volume programs 
this could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s inability to provide comparable or better manufacturing services at a lower cost than its competitors could cause sales to decline 
in addition  competitors can copy the company s non proprietary designs after the company has invested in development of products for customers  thereby enabling such competitors to offer lower prices on such products due to savings in development costs 
concentration of major customers at present  the company s customer base is highly concentrated and could become even more concentrated 
the company s largest ems customer accounted for of net sales in fiscal year this same customer accounted for of sales in and in for the fiscal years ended   and  the five largest customers accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products from the company at current levels 
moreover  the company typically does not enter into long term volume purchase contracts with its customers  and the company s customers have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders 
the loss of one or more of the company s major customers  or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from such customers  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on suppliers the company is dependent on many suppliers  including sole source suppliers  to provide key components and raw materials used in manufacturing customers products 
delays in deliveries from suppliers or the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and raw materials could cause delays or reductions in shipment of products to our customers which could adversely affect the company s operating results and damage customer relationships 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
the competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
foreign manufacturing operations virtually all products manufactured by the company are produced at the company s facilities located in mexico and china 
accordingly  the company s operations are subject to a variety of risks unique to international operations including import and export duties and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws and foreign economic and political risk 
technological change and new product risk the markets for the company s customers products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life cycles 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company s success will depend upon its customers ability to enhance existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address evolving and increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
failure of the company s 
table of contents customers to do so could substantially harm the company s customers competitive positions 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing products that respond to technological change  emerging industry standards or evolving customer requirements

holders of the common stock will suffer immediate and substantial dilution to the extent outstanding options to purchase the common stock are exercised 
the stock price of the company may be subject to wide fluctuations and possible rapid increases or declines over a short time period 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company such as variations in quarterly operating results or changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors relating to the ems and computer industries or to the securities markets in general  which  in recent years  have experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded
