table of contents significant accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions trade and consumer promotion program the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers  such as cooperative advertising programs  feature price discounts  in store display incentives and coupons 
the recognition of the costs for these programs  which are classified as a reduction of revenue  involves use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates 
estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors 
actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangibles  are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment  while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other long lived asset impairment 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
pension and postretirement medical benefits the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees

the estimated return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance  considering the company s current and projected investment mix

the value of plan assets  used in the calculation of pension expense  is determined on a calculated method that recognizes of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method 
gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date
