item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of ralcorp holdings  inc this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under item  especially note  and the cautionary statement on forward looking statements on page the terms we  our  company  and ralcorp as used herein refer to ralcorp holdings  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
recently issued accounting standards see note for a discussion regarding recently issued accounting standards  including fas revised  eitf  and fsp results of operations consolidated net earnings net earnings were million in fiscal  million in  and million in the decrease in was due primarily to a goodwill impairment loss of million after taxes 
fiscal results improved primarily as a result of business acquisitions and organic growth 
more detailed discussion and analysis of these and other factors follows 
net sales net sales for fiscal increased million from fiscal net sales were million higher than in ralcorp s results included post acquisition results from the lofthouse business acquired january   the bakery chef business acquired december   and the concept bakers cb business acquired february  excluding sales from the two businesses acquired during fiscal  net sales grew by from refer to the segment discussions below for other factors affecting net sales 
operating expenses cost of products sold was   and of net sales in   and  respectively  while selling  general and administrative sg a was   and 
the fiscal cost of products sold percentage declined primarily as a result of changes in business mix 
in addition  it was favorably impacted by production efficiencies due to increased volumes and lower accelerated depreciation related to restructuring projects 
although the prices of energy  freight  and several ingredients notably soybean oil  eggs  rice  wheat flour  and various tree nuts increased significantly compared to prior year costs  most of the effects were mitigated during fiscal through hedging  forward purchase contracts  and selling price increases 
the increase in the sg a percentage from to was due to the fact that fiscal sg a included million of incremental expenses associated with a pilot project to upgrade information systems  million related to accounts receivable losses caused by the bankruptcy of the fleming companies  inc fleming  and million related to the recall of a product produced for a co manufacturing customer 
fiscal sg a included million of expenses associated with the implementation of large scale information systems upgrades and conversions  which will continue through fiscal again  refer to the segment discussions below for other factors affecting cost of products sold and sg a expenses 
in addition  refer to our policy regarding cost of products sold in note because our gross profit percentages may not be comparable to tho se of other companies who report cost of products sold on a different basis 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased to million in from million in and million in as a result of changing debt levels and interest rates 
we reduced our long term debt from million at the beginning of fiscal to million by september  as cash from operations exceeded cash needs for business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and stock repurchases 
since nearly all of our interest rates were set on a short term basis during that time  the declining market rates also had a favorable effect on interest expense 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we issued million in fixed rate notes  and market rates headed back up throughout the year 
the weighted average interest rate on all of the company s outstanding debt was in  compared to in and in for more information about our long term debt  see note refer to note for information about our agreement to sell our trade accounts receivable on an ongoing basis  including amounts of related discounts 

table of contents goodwill impairment loss we recorded a goodwill impairment loss in fiscal in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test of each of our reporting units during the fourth quarter 
in the first step of the test  the fair value of each reporting unit was compared with its carrying amount 
based on that indicator  only the carriage house reporting unit ie  the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment had a potential impairment  and the second step of the test was conducted for that unit to determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the im plied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable net assets 
estimated fair values were determined based on the best information available  including independent appraisals and the results of valuation techniques such as ebitda multiples and discounted future cash flows 
the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated to be million  compared to the carrying value of million  so the goodwill impairment loss was determined to be million 
a portion of carriage house s goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes  so the deferred tax benefit of the loss was only million 
factors leading to the impairment included the bankruptcy of fleming formerly a significant customer of carriage house  the inability to quickly replace lost co manufacturing business  the increasing competitive pricing pressures in the private label food industry  and the near term p roduction inefficiencies arising from the carriage house restructuring initiatives discussed below 
for more information about carriage house operations and our commitment to improving results  refer to the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces sections below 
restructuring charges in  the company closed its plant in kansas city  ks  and moved production to other facilities within the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment 
annual cost savings from this project  which included termination benefits and other charges totaling 
million  are expected to be million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced our plans to close our in store bakery isb facility in kent  wa  part of the cereals  crackers cookies segment  and began transferring production from that facility and two other isb facilities to a new isb plant located in utah 
this project was completed in fiscal and is expected to result in annual cost savings of to million 
restructuring charges for this project totaled million in and million in  including operating lease termination costs  costs related to the removal and relocation of equipment  equipment write offs  and employee termination benefits 
in fiscal  the company reduced operations at its facility in streator  il  and transferred production of all product lines except peanut butter to other dressings  syrups  jellies sauces locations to realize annual cost savings of to million 
related employee termination benefits and equipment write offs totaled million 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold our ketchup business  including certain equipment and inventory  and recorded a net loss of million 
further  we determined that the resulting reduced cash flows from our tomato paste business  which had supplied the company s ketchup production  was less than the carrying value of our paste production facility located near williams  ca  and an impairment charge of million was recorded as of december  on february   we sold the tomato paste business  including the williams facility  and recorded an additional loss of million 
the ketchup and paste operations were both relatively minor parts of the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment 
for more information regarding these restructuring charges  see note litigation settlement income we received payments in fiscal   and in settlement of legal claims  nearly all of which related to vitamin antitrust litigation 
the respective amounts recorded were 
million  million  and million  net of related expenses 
additional amounts are not expected at this time 
income taxes income tax provisions generally reflect statutory tax rates  adjusted by the effects of non deductible goodwill amortization expense or impairment losses 
the effective rate was approximately in  in  and in the rate included the effect of the non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment loss 
excluding that effect  the rate was about 
the effective rate is also affected by changes in our business mix which affect state apportionment 
the effective rate is expected to remain at approximately for fiscal see note for more information about income taxes 
equity in earnings of vail resorts  inc in fiscal  we recorded pre tax income of 
million from our investment in vail resorts nyse ticker mtn 
for fiscal and  we recorded pre tax losses of 
million and million  respectively  from the vail investment 
those losses included adjustments totaling 
million in and million in to reflect the cumulative effect of vail s earnings restatements for prior years

table of contents cereals  crackers cookies fiscal vs 
fiscal for the year ended september   net sales for the cereals  crackers cookies segment were up million percent from fiscal  with bremner and ralston foods contributing increases of million and million  respectively 
excluding cb sales  which were the source of half of bremner s growth  base cracker and cookie volumes were up percent  and isb volume was flat 
for ralston foods  most of the increase was the result of percent growth in rte cereal sales volume  partially offset by a percent decline in hot cereal volume 
in addition  net sales from rte co manufacturing were up million for the year 
like net sales  the segment s profit contribution improved percent for the year 
higher costs of rice  corn  wheat  soybean oil  eggs  raisins  freight  and energy were offset by production efficiencies  favorable sales mix  and lower information systems expense 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales for the cereals  crackers cookies segment were up percent in fiscal from fiscal  with the ralston foods cereal division and the bremner cracker and cookie division contributing increases of million and million  respectively 
about million of the bremner growth is attributable to an additional four months of sales from lofthouse  acquired on january   while the remainder came through ongoing expansion with existing customers 
cracker volume was up percent and base cookie volume was down percent 
excluding lofthouse sales for the first four months  isb volume was up percent year over year 
for ralston foods  an increase in co manufactured ready to eat rte cereal sales offset a decline in store brand rte cerea l for the year largely due to the fleming bankruptcy  so combined rte volume was flat 
hot cereal volume was up percent despite losses related to the fleming bankruptcy  but most of the relative sales dollar improvement at ralston foods was due to the amount and timing of promotional discounts 
the segment s profit contribution was up million percent for fiscal the improvement is primarily attributable to the increased sales  but also to the reduced promotional activity in the current year  reduced expenses related to capital projects  lower freight costs  and favorable product mix 
those benefits were partially offset by rising costs of insurance  employee benefits  and ingredients such as wheat flour  soybean oil  honey  cocoa  and sugar 
dressings  syrups  jellies sauces the company s dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment s net sales decreased from million in to in and in the declines are attributable primarily to the loss of a major co manufacturing customer at the beginning of fiscal  the exit from the ketchup and industrial tomato paste businesses during  the effects of the fleming bankruptcy in april  and the loss of a major pourable salad dressing customer in the second half of fiscal these sales reductions were partially offset by increased business with several customers  as well as by price increases on some product lines in an attempt to mitigate escalating costs of certain ingredients 
the segment s profit contribution was of net sales in fiscal years and  and of net sales in fiscal the profit percentage fell as a result of increased production costs due to inefficiencies related to the significant volume decline and restructuring initiatives  pricing pressures  and charges related to the fleming bankruptcy 
in fiscal  we saw production cost improvements from our restructuring and process improvement projects 
snack nuts candy net sales for the snack nuts candy segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and then jumped to million in fiscal the growth was generated primarily through increases in volume with several customers  partially offset by continued competitive pricing pressures  an unfavorable product mix  and a significant reduction in first quarter holiday orders from a major customer 
the growth came primarily from further increases in orders from existing top customers for both continuing and new private label items  but also from price increases driven by higher ingredient costs 

table of contents the segment s profit contribution decreased million from as price increases lagged increases in the cost of ingredients especially tree nuts such as macadamias  almonds  and pecans 
the profit comparison was made more difficult by significantly reduced peanut costs in  followed by competitive pricing pressures that reduced peanut margins in in  the weighted average ingredient costs per pound were approximately percent higher than in the prior year 
in addition  fiscal profit was reduced by higher energy costs and information systems costs 
fiscal profit contribution was million higher than in as a result of the sales increase and favorable peanut costs  partially offset by increased costs on other ingredie nts 
frozen pancakes  biscuits breads on december   ralcorp completed the purchase of bakery chef  a leading manufacturer of frozen griddle products pancakes  waffles  and french toast and pre baked biscuits and breads 
ralcorp paid a total of approximately million in cash to acquire bakery chef  which had net sales of million for the year ended december  and million since acquisition 
bakery chef has contributed million of profit since acquisition  net of million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded in purchase accounting 
the profit contribution has been reduced by unfavorable ingredient costs primarily eggs and soybean oil  partially offset by price increases 
net of related financing costs discussed below  this acquisition added appro ximately 
to ralcorp s diluted earnings per share during fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded operating needs by generating positive cash flows through operations 
we expect to continue generating operating cash flows through our mix of businesses and expect that short term and long term liquidity requirements will be met through a combination of operating cash flows and strategic use of borrowings under committed and uncommitted credit arrangements 
capital resources remained strong at september   with a net worth of million and a long term debt to total capital ratio of percent  compared to corresponding figures for september   of million and percent 
working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  increased to million at september   from million at september   primarily as a result of an increase in our investment in ralcorp receivables corporation of million and the addition of the bakery chef and cb businesses  offset by million of dividends payable recorded in september operating activities cash flows from operating activities were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
operating cash flows were augmented in fiscal by million of proceeds from the sale of ownership interests in accounts receivable 
each year since then  we have reduced the amount of interests sold  with decreases of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
as of september   we did not sell any ownership interests 
see off balance sheet financing below for more information about the sale of receivables 
in fiscal and especially in fiscal  an emphasis on working capital reduction resulted in lower inventory levels  while inventory levels increased in due to changes in both quantity to support higher sales volumes and costs 
accounts payable have fluctuated due to the timing of purchases 
in  operating cash flows were reduced by a million contribution to our qualified pension plan  included in other  net on the statement of cash flows 
we do not expect to be required to make any significant contributions to this plan in fiscal see note for more information about pension plans  including the funded status 
investing activities net cash paid for business acquisitions totaled million in fiscal bakery chef and cb and million in fiscal lofthouse foods 
see note for more information about acquisitions 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to the information systems projects  restructuring projects  and projects at the newly acquired businesses 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between and million 
as discussed below  we have adequate capacity under current borrowing arrangements to meet these cash needs 
in fiscal  ralcorp received million of proceeds from the sale of its carriage house facility in san jose  ca  with no material gain or loss 

table of contents financing activities strong operating cash flows and reduced acquisition activity allowed ralcorp to reduce its long term debt in fiscal and by million and million  respectively 
on may   we issued floating rate senior notes  series a  in the amount of  maturing on may  borrowings under this private placement debt financing incur interest at a rate of month libor plus  adjusted quarterly  with interest payable quarterly in arrears 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our shorter term credit arrangements 
initially  cash for the bakery chef acquisition was borrowed under our revolving credit agreement and uncommitted credit arrangements  but on december   we completed a million private placement of long term fixed rate senior notes yielding a weighted average interest rate of 
details about these notes are included in note as of september   total remaining availability under our million revolving credit agreement and our million uncommitted credit arrangements was million 
currently  the most restrictive covenant is a maximum total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of as of september   we were in compliance with all covenants  with a total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of the million agreement expired october   and was replaced with a similar million agreement expiring in five years 
see note for details 
supplementing our available borrowing capacity  our balance sheet included million of cash and cash equivalents at september  in addition  under the agreement described under off balance sheet financing below  we could choose to sell up to million of ownership interests in accounts receivable 
further cash needs could be met through the sale of the company s investment in vail resorts  inc  which had a market value of million at september  see note 
on september   our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share  payable on october   to shareholders of record as of the close of business on october  the dividend payout totaled approximately million 
delivering value to ralcorp shareholders in the form of a special dividend recognized their continued support of the company while validating the company s business plan and reflecting the resulting growth in the company s net worth 
the company believes that paying the special dividend was a direct and efficient way to distribute surplus capital to ralcorp s shareholders and manage the company s balance sheet without adversely affecting its ability to continue to pursue acquisition opportuni ties  make capital expenditures  or reduce its debt 
in november  the board approved a tender offer for up to  shares at a single price not in excess of and not less than per share 
the offer was in the form of a modified dutch auction where the final price is determined based upon the number of shares  and the respective prices  tendered 
the offer resulted in the purchase of million shares at a purchase price of per share 
as of september    shares remained available for repurchase by the company pursuant to previous authorizations by the board of directors 
off balance sheet financing as an additional source of liquidity  on september   ralcorp entered into an agreement to sell  on an ongoing basis  all of its trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary called ralcorp receivables corporation rrc 
rrc can then sell up to million of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables to a bank commercial paper conduit the conduit 
rrc s only business activities relate to acquiring and selling interests in ralcorp s receivables 
upon the agreement s termination  the conduit would be entitled to all cash collections on rrc s accounts receivable until its purchased interest has been repaid 
unless extended  the agreement will terminate in october the trade receivables sale arrangement with rrc represents off balance sheet financing since the sale results in assets being removed from our balance sheet rather than resulting in a liability to the conduit 
the organization documents of rrc and the terms of the agreements governing the receivables sale transactions make rrc a qualifying special purpose entity 
as such  it is not to be consolidated in ralcorp s financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
furthermore  the true sale nature of the arrangement requires ralcorp to account for rrc s transactions with the conduit as a sale of accounts receivable instead of reflecting the conduit s net investment as debt with a pledge of accounts receivable a s collateral 
if rrc were not a qualifying special purpose entity and if the arrangement were not considered a true sale  the outstanding balance of receivables would remain on ralcorp s balance sheet  proceeds received from the conduit none as of september  would be shown as short term debt  and there would be no investment in rrc 
see further discussion in note 
table of contents contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts and commitments which obligate us to make payments in the future 
the table below sets forth our significant future obligations by time period as of september  less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c deferred compensation obligations d total a long term debt obligations include principal and interest payments based on interest rates at september  see note for details 
b operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases  as shown in note c purchase obligations are legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
d deferred compensation obligations have been allocated to time periods based on existing payment plans for terminated employees and the estimated timing of distributions to current employees based on age 
inflation we recognize that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on the company through higher asset replacement costs  related depreciation and higher material costs 
we try to minimize these effects through cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as price increases to maintain reasonable profit margins 
it is our view that inflation has not had a significant impact on operations in the three years ended september outlook we believe the opportunities in the private label  value brand  and food service areas are favorable for long term growth 
in the past few years  we have taken substantial steps to reshape the company  reducing our reliance on any one business segment while achieving sufficient scale in the categories in which we operate 
we expect to continue to improve our business mix through volume and profit growth of existing businesses  as well as through acquisitions or alliances 
we will continue to explore those acquisition opportunities that strategically fit with our intention to be the premier provider of value oriented food products 
acquisitions are integrated into ralcorp operations depending upon a number of criteria  including continuation of the current management team  organizational reporting relationships  available synergies to be gained through the consolidation of like operations  as well as other factors 
many past acquisitions have continued to utilize their own stand alone information systems 
in  the company commenced the systematic conversion of these disparate division and facility information systems to new  integrated company wide information systems software provided primarily by jd edwards peoplesoft 
these conversions commenced in september with two snack nut facilities and are expected to continue well into fiscal food producers have introduced product lines deemed to have low or reduced carbohydrates to meet the demands of consumers who are following the atkins  south beach  or other dietary plans 
many of our product lines contain significant amounts of carbohydrates 
changes in consumers preferences and the potential popularity of new low carbohydrate products could adversely affect our businesses  but the impact  if any  cannot be determined at this time 
freight costs have been increasing and are expected to remain at elevated levels at least through the first six months of fiscal  thereby reducing profit margins 
these cost increases are primarily the result of rising fuel prices 
further  a shortage of available common carriers in some areas is putting additional upward pressure on freight rates as well as having a negative effect on our customer service 
in fiscal  freight costs were approximately percent of our cost of products sold 
in july  the food and drug administration issued a final rule amending its regulations on nutrition labeling to require that trans fat be declared in the nutrition label of conventional foods and dietary supplements on a separate line immediately under the line for the declaration of saturated fat 
the new rule will be effective january 
table of contents  because of this regulatory change  we are incurring additional costs related to packaging modifications 
furthermore  given the increased focus on trans fat content and the related health risks indicated by recently published scientific studies  we may incur additional costs to research and implement formulation changes to certain products 
the ultimate impact of this regulation upon our businesses cannot be determined at this time 
on an enterprise wide basis  we attempt to manage cost increases through forward purchase contracts  hedging  and selling price increases 
although the prices of energy  freight  and several ingredients increased significantly compared to prior year costs 
most of the effects were mitigated during fiscal through those efforts 
during long periods of rising commodity costs  such as we have experienced in fiscal and the beginning of fiscal  these mitigation efforts can become less effective as favorable contracts expire or suppliers are unable to fulfill their obligations 
if these costs remain at elevated levels as expected and sales volumes exceed current commodity coverage  fiscal profit margins could be reduced 
the following sections contain discussions of the specific factors affecting the outlook for each of our reportable segments 
cereals  crackers cookies the level of competition in the cereal category continues to be intense for our ralston foods division 
competition comes from branded box cereal manufacturers  branded bagged cereal producers and other private label cereal providers 
for the last several years  category growth in ready to eat and hot cereals has been minimal or has declined  which has exacerbated its competitive nature 
when branded competitors focus on price promotion  the environment for private label producers becomes more challenging 
we must maintain an effective price gap between our quality private label cereal products and those of branded cereal producers  thereby providing the best value alternative for the consumer 
pricing and volume agreements with customers are generally determined by the customers periodic requests for competitive category reviews in each of our divisions 
during fiscal  ralston foods participated in several of these category reviews and was able to maintain or grow volumes  albeit at reduced margin levels 
ralston foods anticipates additional category review requests to occur during fiscal in this environment  it is imperative that volume gains substantially offset the continued pricing pressures 
as noted above  increasing costs are intensifying margin pressures 
further  increases in employee health care  other benefit costs  energy and freight are expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
accordingly  aggressive cost containment remains an important goal of the organization 
in addition  increased distribution is required to remain competitive whether through new and improved product emulations or new co manufacturing opportunities 
our cracker and cookie operation  bremner  also conducts business in a highly competitive category and is affected by many of the same cost and pricing challenges 
major branded competitors continue to market and promote their offerings aggressively and many smaller  regional branded and private label manufacturers provide additional competitive pressures 
recently  there has been minimal growth in the cookie and cracker categories  intensifying the competition 
bremner s ability to maintain a sufficient price gap between products of branded producers and bremner s quality private label emulations will be important to its results of operations 
in addition  bremner will continue to focus on cost containment  new products and volume growth of existing products in order to improve operating results 
on january   bake line group  llc  a producer of cookies and crackers  filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in delaware and ceased operations 
since then  bremner has begun supplying products to several of bake line s former customers 
we expect sales to continue to increase in the first quarter of fiscal as additional products are finalized for former bake line customers  but the effects may be partially offset by declining co manufacturing sales 
we have completed the consolidation of lofthouse and cascade into a single operating facility in ogden  ut  with expected annual cost savings of approximately to million which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal the february addition of cb  a producer of par baked frozen breads  provides the isb operations with an expanded product line 
in october  operations of the isb business began reporting to management of bakery chef  who in turn report combined results to ralcorp s top management 
consequently  in fiscal the isb business will be combined with bakery chef in a reportable segment known as frozen bakery products rather than with bremner in cereals  crackers cookies 
comparative historical data will be restated to conform to the new presentation 

table of contents dressings  syrups  jellies sauces carriage house s competitors  both large and small  continue to be aggressive on pricing 
in addition  the division continues to be negatively affected by certain ingredient and packaging cost increases including soybean oil as well as increased employee health care  benefits  and freight costs 
as warranted  we will continue to seek price increases to help offset these rising costs 
the segment s operating performance has improved from prior periods as a result of recent restructuring  including the sales of underperforming operations and related plant rationalizations  and ongoing process improvement and overhead reduction projects 
most recently  in june of  carriage house finalized a plan to close its plant in kansas city  kansas  and move production to other facilities 
annual savings from this plant closure are expected to be million beginning in fiscal in addition  carriage house recently initiated administrative staffing reductions in a number of facilities  with estimated annual cost savings of million 
costs associated with these reductions  including severance pay and outplacement services  are estimated at 
million  most of which were recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal in june  a major customer began purchasing pourable salad dressings from one of our competitors in order to achieve lower prices 
the resulting loss of profit is expected to be more than offset by the aforementioned actions taken to reduce overhead costs 
in addition  management is continuing its effort to replace the lost volume through additional sales to new and existing customers 
snack nuts candy snack nuts and candy continue to be very competitive categories 
this segment of ralcorp faces significant competition from branded manufacturers as well as private label and regional producers  and we expect the current margin pressure to continue into the foreseeable future 
the majority of the cost of products sold relates to commodities including peanuts  cashews  and tree nuts such as macadamias  pecans  and almonds 
the cost of these commodities fluctuate  sometimes drastically  based upon worldwide supply and demand 
these commodity fluctuations  when not accompanied by pricing changes due to competition  can result in short term changes in the profitability of the segment 
we currently have committed contracts for a large portion of our commodity needs for the firs t half of fiscal during that period  we expect peanut and cashew costs to remain relatively constant while tree nuts are expected to increase slightly from current levels  however  tree nut costs will be considerably higher than in the corresponding period of fiscal whenever possible  we will continue to implement price increases to help offset these rising costs 
the segment has recently initiated staffing reductions at several locations  with expected annual cost savings of 
million 
costs associated with these reductions  including severance pay and outplacement services  are estimated at 
million  most of which was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the segment will continue to focus on maintaining its customer base and the high quality of its products and on developing new products 
frozen pancakes  biscuits breads bakery chef produces frozen pancakes  waffles  french toast  biscuits  and breads  as well as dry mixes  and competes primarily in the foodservice channel 
the foodservice channel is comprised of three major categories national restaurant chains  distributors who provide products to restaurants  and management firms who manage food operations within schools  offices  and other institutions 
bakery chef s major customers include restaurant chains  foodservice operators  and retailers 
competition consists of other producers of similar products for foodservice customers  as well as branded and store brand suppliers to retailers 
it is critical for bakery chef to provide high quality products  excellent customer service  superior product innovation  and competitive pric ing to its customers 
new product offerings  new foodservice and retail customers  and growth of existing customers will all be important to the future success of this segment 
for fiscal  bakery chef s profit contribution was reduced by unfavorable ingredient costs specifically eggs and soybean oil  partially offset by selling price increases 
these ingredient cost increases have abated somewhat in the past several months  but costs remain high compared to the prior year putting continued pressure on margins 
bakery chef s focus for fiscal is to capitalize on the previously mentioned coordination of bakery chef with the isb business by offering an expanded product grouping to the combined customer base of the two organizations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion is presented pursuant to the united states securities and exchange commission s financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the policies below are both important to the representation of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue is recognized when title of goods is transferred to the customer  as specified by the shipping terms 
products are generally sold with no right of return except in the case of goods which do not meet product specifications or are damaged 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive offerings based upon each customer s redemption history 
should a greater proportion of customers redeem incentives than estimated  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete product and packaging materials 
the estimated allowance is based on a review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
we conduct a goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the goodwill impairment tests require us to estimate the fair value of our businesses and certain assets and liabilities  for which we utilize valuation techniques such as ebitda multiples and discounted cash flows based on projections 
in our recent tests  we assumed ebitda multiples in the range of to and discount rates in the range of to 
pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market related value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  discount rates  and future salary increases  and other assumptions inherent in these valuations 
we annually review the assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations and makes changes to these assumptions  based on current market conditions  as necessary 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense or income ultimately recognized 
the other postretirement benefits liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected b y assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in healthcare costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected healthcare costs will affect the recorded amount of other postretirement benefits expense 
see note for more information about pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions 
liabilities for workers compensation claims and accrued health care costs including a reserve for claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated based on details of current claims  historical experience  and expected trends determined on an actuarial basis 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  including futures contracts and options  to manage certain of these exposures when it is practical to do so 
as of september  and  a hypothetical adverse change in the market price of the comp any s principal commodities  including corn  oats  wheat and soybean oil  would have decreased the fair value of the company s derivatives portfolio by million and million  respectively 
this volatility analysis ignores changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged transactions 
because the company does not hold or trade derivatives for speculation or profit  all changes in derivative values are effectively offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures 
for more information  see note and note to the financial statements included in item the company has interest rate risk with respect to interest expense on variable rate debt 
at september  and  the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
a hypothetical adverse change in weighted average interest rates during fiscal and would have had an unfavorable impact of 
million on both the company s net earnings and cash flows each year
