item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future 
forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward looking statements as a result of many known or unknown factors  including  but not limited to  those factors discussed on pages to under the heading risk factors 
also  please read the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements set forth at the beginning of this annual report 
please read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview renal care group provides dialysis services to patients with chronic kidney failure 
as of december   we provided dialysis and ancillary services to over  patients through outpatient dialysis centers in states  in addition to providing acute dialysis services to more than hospitals 
our net revenue has been derived primarily from the following sources outpatient hemodialysis services  ancillary services associated with outpatient dialysis  primarily the administration of epo and other drugs  home dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services provided to acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities  laboratory services  and management contracts with hospital based medical university dialysis programs 
most patients with end stage renal disease receive three dialysis treatments each week in an outpatient setting 
reimbursement for these services is provided primarily by the medicare esrd program based on rates established by the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue was derived from reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare reimbursement is subject to rate and other legislative changes by congress and periodic changes in regulations  including changes that may reduce payments under the esrd program 
neither congress nor cms approved an increase in the composite rate for  or the medicaid programs in some of the states in which we operate have formerly reimbursed us  or currently reimburse us  at rates higher than those paid by medicare 
some of these programs  like washington s and wisconsin s  have approved and implemented reductions in reimbursement 
other programs have proposed reductions or have announced that they are considering reductions 
if all the states in which we operate that have medicaid rates that are higher than medicare rates were to reduce their rates to medicare rates  and giving effect to the reductions already implemented in washington and wisconsin  our earnings per share will likely be adversely affected by between and per share in we assumed that these reductions would occur when we set and communicated our corporate goals for the medicare composite rate applies to a designated group of outpatient dialysis services  including the dialysis treatment  supplies used for the treatment  certain laboratory tests and medications  and most of the home dialysis services we provide 
we receive separate reimbursement outside the composite rate for some other services  drugs including specific drugs such as epo and some physician ordered tests  including laboratory tests  provided to dialysis patients 

table of contents if a patient has private health insurance  then that patient s treatment is typically reimbursed at rates significantly higher than those paid by medicare during the first months of care 
after that period medicare becomes the primary payor 
reimbursement for dialysis services provided pursuant to a hospital contract is negotiated with the individual hospital and is usually higher than medicare rates 
because dialysis is a life sustaining therapy to treat a chronic disease  utilization is predictable and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our net revenue and net income from the administration of epo 
epo is manufactured by a single company  amgen inc in april  amgen implemented its third epo price increase of in as many years 
because we were already under contract with amgen through  this price increase did not affect our results of operations during key components of the pricing formula were maintained in our contract with amgen 
therefore  while the price increase had an adverse affect on our results of operations  we were able to mitigate approximately of the increase 
amgen did not implement a price increase in  but changes in our contract with amgen for may result in an increase in our cost of epo 
we estimated the impact of these changes and assumed they would take place when we set and communicated our corporate goals for critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission issued a financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
in accordance with that release  we have identified accounting policies that we consider critical to our business 
management identified these policies based on their importance to the consolidated financial statements and on the degrees of subjectivity and complexity involved in these policies 
in addition to these critical policies  a summary of significant accounting policies is included in our consolidated financial statements and related notes  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to net revenue and contractual provisions and provision for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
net revenue and contractual provisions we recognize revenue net of contractual provisions as services are provided 
contractual provisions represent the difference between our gross billed charges and the amount we expect to receive 
under the medicare esrd program  medicare reimbursement rates for outpatient dialysis treatments are fixed under a composite rate structure 
the composite rate applies to a designated group of outpatient dialysis services  including the dialysis treatment  supplies for the treatment  some laboratory tests and some medications 
there are other drugs  laboratory tests and services that are eligible for separate reimbursement outside the composite rate 
most state medicaid plans follow reimbursement methodologies that are similar to the medicare program  but other payors  particularly private insurance plans and managed care payors  reimburse us under contractual arrangements or based on our charges 
each of these payor sources provides unique challenges to the process of recording contractual provisions 
we have made significant investments in human resources and information systems to enable us to estimate the appropriate amount of contractual provisions as services are provided 
actual levels of reimbursement  however  are sometimes difficult to determine due to the complexity of the applicable regulations or contracts 
as a result  we may in fact collect more or less than the amount expected when the services are provided 
in addition  regulations and contracts may be changed  making system updates and maintenance necessary for estimating net revenue accurately 
as a result  management 
table of contents may make adjustments to the contractual provisions estimated by the system based on actual collection experience and other factors 
provision for doubtful accounts collecting outstanding accounts receivable is critical to our success 
our primary source of collection risk is related to the portion of our charges for which the patient is responsible 
the patients responsibility is typically between and of gross charges 
we record an estimate of the provision for doubtful accounts in the period in which the revenue is recognized based on management s estimate of the net collectibility of the accounts receivable 
management estimates and monitors the net collectibility of accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors  including the analysis of payor mix  subsequent collection analysis and review of detailed agings of accounts receivable 
significant changes in our payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
self insurance accruals from time to time  we are subject to professional liability  general liability and workers compensation claims or lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we maintain insurance for professional liability and general liability claims exceeding certain individual amounts and workers compensation claims exceeding certain individual and aggregate amounts 
we estimate the self insured retention portion of professional liability  general liability and workers compensation risks using third party actuarial calculations that include historical claims data  demographic factors and other assumptions 
the estimated accrual for professional liability  general liability and workers compensation claims could be significantly affected  if current and future occurrences differ from historical claims trends 
while management monitors current claims closely and considers outcomes when estimating its insurance accruals  the complexity of the claims  the wide range of potential outcomes and changes in the legal climate often complicate our ability to make precise estimates 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets we review goodwill  long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment at least once a year and at any other time management identifies events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the discounted present value of future net cash flows management expects the asset to generate 
the computation of future net cash flows is often complex and includes subjective assumptions 
if management determines that assets are impaired  then the impairment is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets  as determined by independent appraisals or estimates of discounted future cash flows 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth results of operations in thousands for the periods indicated and the percentage of net revenue represented by the respective financial line items year ended december  net revenue patient care costs general and administrative expenses provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization total operating costs and expenses income from operations interest expense  net minority interest income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the number of treatments we performed from  in to  in and a increase in the average patient revenue per dialysis treatment from in to in the growth in treatments was the result of the acquisition and development of various dialysis facilities and a increase in same market treatments for over we anticipate reductions in same market treatment rate of growth during we estimate that approximately of the increase in revenue per treatment in was largely attributable to the rate increase to private payors that we implemented during the fourth quarter of the remaining per treatment increase was the net result of both favorable and unfavorable payor contract resolutions 
during we experienced favorable payor contract resolutions of per treatment  which was offset by per treatments of unfavorable payor resolutions a portion of which relate to reduced reimbursement experienced with certain managed care contracts and reduced reimbursement in certain state medicaid programs 
assuming a full year impact in these reductions  we expect our patient revenue per dialysis treatment to be negatively impacted by approximately consistent with previous years we implemented a rate increase to private payors during the fourth quarter of  and we believe this increase will offset most of the decrease noted above 
accordingly  we expect patient revenue per dialysis treatment to remain flat or increase slightly in as compared to patient care costs 
patient care costs consist of costs directly related to the care of patients  including direct labor  drugs and other medical supplies  and operational costs of facilities 
patient care costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due principally to the increase in the number of treatments performed during the period  which was reflected in corresponding increases in the use of labor  drugs and supplies 
patient care costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in patient care costs per treatment increased from in to in the increase in patient care costs per treatment was due to increases in the price of epo  labor costs  the cost of insurance  increases in self insurance accruals  and the utilization of certain ancillary drugs 
management believes that the company will continue to face increases in the cost of labor and insurance in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include corporate office costs and other costs not directly related to the care of patients  including facility administration  accounting  billing and information systems 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due primarily to a million charge recorded in the first quarter of for a retirement benefit plan for our former chairman  chief executive officer and president that was adopted in january general and administrative expenses as percentage of revenue increased from in to in the charge for the retirement package accounted for substantially all of the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue

liquidity and capital resources renal care group requires capital primarily to acquire and develop dialysis centers  to purchase property and equipment for existing centers  to repurchase shares of our common stock and to finance working capital needs 
at december   our working capital was million  cash and cash equivalents were million  and our current ratio was to our working capital increased during the year primarily as a result of the increase in operating cash flows

table of contents the year ended december  cash used in financing activities primarily reflects million in repurchases of our common stock  partially offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock as stock options were exercised 
in july  we entered into two credit agreements with a group of banks totaling million consisting of a million second amended and restated loan agreement the multi year facility and a million loan agreement the day facility 
the multi year facility had a final maturity of july   and the day facility had a final maturity of june   based on an amendment made in june as of december  there were no amounts outstanding under the multi year facility or the day facility  and the company had million available under these agreements 
on february   we entered into a new credit agreement the agreement with a group of banks totaling up to million 
the agreement replaced the multi year facility and the day facility discussed above 
this credit agreement has a million revolving credit facility  a committed million dollar term loan facility and a million incremental term loan facility 
our ability to borrow under the committed term loan facility expires in may all of these committed facilities have a final maturity of february  the credit agreement provides that million of the committed term loan facility may only be used to finance our acquisition of national nephrology associates 
to the extent we do not use that amount to fund the acquisition  unborrowed amounts will increase the size of the incremental term loan facility 
borrowings under the incremental term loan facility are subject to obtaining commitments from the banks finalizing specific terms 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million of the committed term loan facility may be used for acquisitions  repurchases of our stock  capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at variable rates determined by our leverage ratio 
this variable rate debt instrument carries a degree of interest rate risk 
specifically  we will face higher interest costs on this debt if interest rates rise 
each of our wholly owned subsidiaries has guaranteed all of our obligations under the agreement 
further  our obligations under the agreement  and our subsidiaries obligations under their guarantees  are secured by a pledge of the equity interests we hold in each of our subsidiaries 
the agreement includes financial covenants that are customary based on the amount and duration of the agreement 
we intend to use this facility to complete our previously announced million share repurchase and our acquisition of national nephrology associates 
assuming we complete both of these initiatives we will have more than million in outstanding indebtedness 
this indebtedness will include million in senior subordinated notes of national nephrology associates that we will assume in the acquisition 
these notes bear interest at the rate of per annum 
as a result of this indebtedness  we will incur substantial interest expense in a significant component of our growth strategy is the acquisition and development of dialysis facilities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to close acquisition transactions with them on acceptable terms 
management believes that existing cash and funds from operations  together with funds available under our new credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our acquisition  expansion  capital expenditure and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  in order to finance certain large strategic acquisition opportunities  we may need to incur additional short and long term bank indebtedness or to issue equity or debt securities 
the availability and terms of any future financing will depend on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional financing  if required  on acceptable terms 
we plan to make capital expenditures of between million and million  primarily for equipment replacement  expansion of existing dialysis facilities and construction of de novo facilities 
we expect that these capital expenditures will be funded with cash provided by operating activities and our existing credit facilities 
management believes that capital resources available to us will be sufficient to meet the needs of our business  both on a short and long term basis 
management  from time to time  determines the appropriateness of repurchasing its common stock in accordance with a repurchase plan initially authorized by the board of directors in october in  we began repurchasing shares of our common stock by purchasing  shares of common stock for approximately million 
in  we repurchased 
table of contents million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
in october  we announced that the board of directors had approved an increase in the repurchase plan to allow the purchase of up to a total of million in common stock  and we announced that we intended to repurchase million in common stock between november  and march  during  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million 
through december   we had repurchased an aggregate of million shares under the plan  for a total of approximately million 
as of february   we had repurchased approximately million of our common stock between november  and that date  leaving million remaining of the million we intend to repurchase in early the securities and exchange commission has issued a financial reporting release  fr  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this release encourages public companies to give investors additional information about funds that will be required to operate its business in the future under agreements that are in place today 
in accordance with fr  the following table gives information about our existing contractual obligations

in december  the fasb issued revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
until this interpretation  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
application of fin is required during the fourth quarter of for interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities  immediately for all new entities created after february   and for all other types of variable interest entities in the first quarter of the effect of applying the initial consolidation provisions of fin on renal care group s results of operations or financial position as of december  was not significant 
we do not expect the application of the remaining consolidation provisions of fin  as required in the first quarter of  will have a material effect on renal care group s results of operations or financial position

impact of inflation a substantial portion of our net revenue is subject to reimbursement rates that are regulated by the federal government and do not automatically adjust for inflation 
we are unable to increase the amount we receive for the services provided by our dialysis business that are reimbursed under or by reference to the medicare composite rate 
increased operating costs due to inflation  such as labor and supply costs including the cost of epo  without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates  may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and business
