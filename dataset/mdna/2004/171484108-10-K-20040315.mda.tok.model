environmental matterslegislative changes the septic system at our ellis park facility must be replaced with a hook up to city sewers 
the cost of the hook up  which ellis park has expanded in order to include the stabling area  is estimated by the city of henderson  kentucky to be million  which has been provided for in ellis park s capital budget 
the project is expected to be completed during in  we acquired certain assets of louisville downs incorporated for million including the site of the louisville otb 
in conjunction with this purchase  we withheld million from the amount due to the sellers to offset certain costs related to the remediation of environmental contamination associated with underground storage tanks at the site 
all of the million hold back had been utilized as of december  and additional costs of remediation have not yet been conclusively determined 
the sellers had previously received a reimbursement of million from the commonwealth of kentucky for remediation costs  and that amount is now being held in an escrow account to pay further costs of remediation 
approximately million  including interest on the escrow principal  remains in the account 
the seller has submitted a corrective action plan to the state and has reported to the state that all wells  with the exception of one  are below action 
well testing continues and the kentucky environmental and public protection cabinet has not taken final action on this matter 
in addition to the hold back  we have obtained an indemnity to cover the full cost of remediation from the prior owner of the property 
we do not believe the cost of further investigation and remediation will exceed the amount of funds in the escrow 
it is not anticipated that we will have any material liability as a result of compliance with environmental laws with respect to any of our properties

general information about our business we conduct pari mutuel wagering on live thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred horse racing and simulcast signals of races 
additionally  we offer racing services through our other interests 
we operate the churchill downs racetrack in louisville  kentucky  which has conducted thoroughbred racing since and is internationally known as the home of the kentucky derby  and ellis park race course  inc  a thoroughbred racing operation in henderson  kentucky collectively referred to as kentucky operations 
we also own and operate hollywood park  a thoroughbred racing operation in inglewood  california  arlington park  a thoroughbred racing operation in arlington heights  illinois  and calder race course  a thoroughbred racing operation in miami  florida 
additionally  we are the majority owner and operator of hoosier park in anderson  indiana  which conducts thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred horse racing 
we conduct simulcast wagering on horse racing at eleven simulcast wagering facilities in kentucky  indiana and illinois  as well as at our six racetracks 
the churchill downs simulcast network cdsn was developed in to focus on the distribution of the company s simulcast signal 
cdsn provides the principal oversight of our interstate and international simulcast and wagering opportunities  as well as the marketing  sales  operations and data support efforts related to the company owned racing content 
our revenues and earnings are significantly influenced by our racing calendar 
therefore  revenues and operating results for any interim quarter are not generally indicative of the revenues and operating results for the year  and may not be comparable with results for the corresponding period of the previous year 
we historically have very 
return to index few live racing days during the first quarter of each year  with a majority of our live racing occurring in the second  third and fourth quarters  including the running of the kentucky derby and kentucky oaks in the second quarter 
information regarding racing dates at our facilities for and is included in item e  licenses and live racing dates of this form k 
our pari mutuel revenues include commissions on pari mutuel wagering at our racetracks and off track betting facilities net of state pari mutuel taxes  plus simulcast host fees from other wagering sites and source market fees generated from contracts with our in home wagering providers 
in addition to the commissions earned on pari mutuel wagering  we earn pari mutuel related streams of revenues from sources that are not related to wagering 
these other revenues are primarily derived from statutory racing regulations in some of the states where our facilities are located and can fluctuate materially year to year 
non wagering revenues are primarily generated from admissions  sponsorships  licensing rights and broadcast fees  indiana riverboat admissions subsidy  concessions  lease income and other sources 
greater than of our annual revenues are generated by pari mutuel wagering on live and simulcast racing content and in home wagering 
live racing handle includes patron wagers on live races at our live tracks and also wagers made on imported simulcast signals during live race meets 
import simulcasting handle includes wagers on imported signals at our racetracks when the respective tracks are not conducting live race meets and at our otbs throughout the year 
export handle includes all patron wagers made on our live racing signals sent to other tracks or otbs 
in home wagering  or account wagering  consist of patron wagers through an advance deposit account 
the pari mutuel operator retains as revenue a pre determined percentage of the total amount wagered  and the balance is distributed to the winning patrons 
the gross percentages retained on live racing at our various locations range from to 
in general  the commissions earned from import and export simulcasting are contractually determined and average approximately 
all commissions earned from pari mutuel wagering are shared with horsemen through payment of purses based on local contracts and average approximately 
legislative and regulatory changes during the third quarter of  the indiana horse racing commission ihrc finalized decisions regarding riverboat subsidies 
the ihrc affirmed that funds available to cover operating costs for for the two indiana racetracks  hoosier park and indiana downs  will be split on the basis of purses generated by each racetrack 
the ihrc also ruled that the additional supplemental riverboat subsidy  received in the third quarter of  should be allocated as follows one half between the two indiana racetracks on the basis of purses generated  and the remaining one half allocated equally between the two indiana racetracks 
these riverboat subsidy revenues were recognized by hoosier park during on october   indiana downs filed a petition requesting a court to review the ihrc decision regarding the subsidy revenues 
indiana downs maintains all subsidies should be allocated equally between the two indiana racetracks 
hoosier park is a respondent in the court proceeding  and it supports the ihrc ruling 
at this time  the outcome of the court proceedings is unknown  however  this could result in a one time reduction of million in riverboat subsidy revenues for hoosier park if the courts rule in favor of indiana downs 
in addition  hoosier park could potentially be required to transfer million of the purses to indiana downs 
the ihrc also ruled that effective january   and thereafter the riverboat subsidy for purses and operating costs are to be split evenly between the two indiana racetracks  which can be changed by the ihrc or by the enactment of legislation 
this ruling is consistent with the earlier ruling to evenly split the riverboat subsidy revenues between the two racetracks in indiana  reducing hoosier park s subsidy revenues  net of purse expenses  by approximately million in compared to during january and february when there is no live racing in illinois  the illinois racing board irb appoints a thoroughbred racetrack as the host track in illinois 
the irb appointed arlington park as the host track in illinois during january resulting in increased pari mutuel revenues compared to the prior period 
the irb also appointed arlington park as the host track in illinois for portions of january and february  which will result in an additional host days at arlington park during arlington park s future appointment as the host track is subject to the annual appointment by the irb 
as a result of the controversy surrounding a breeders cup ultra pick wager  placed on october   we have established  along with the national thoroughbred racing association  inc ntra  the ntra wagering 
return to index technology group 
the objective of the group is to ensure the security of pari mutuel wagering systems and to eliminate concerns of racing patrons as to the integrity of such systems 
although this controversy involves a vendor of the company  our concerns and rigorous actions are grounded in our interest to protect our patrons 
in kentucky  the excise tax credit for racetracks passed as part of the state budget 
the measure results in a  credit against our excise tax liability for each day of live racing starting july  and ending june  during this will result in a million credit against our excise tax liability and is earmarked for horsemen s incentives and necessary capital improvements 
a similar credit of million was earned during the twelve months ended june  due to shortfalls in the kentucky state budget  it is not anticipated that the excise tax credit will be included in the upcoming kentucky state budget 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most significant estimates relate to the valuation of property and equipment  receivables  goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be significantly affected by changes in the regulatory environment in which the company operates  and to the aggregate costs for self insured liability claims 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k annual report 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  such as those previously described  and from alternative gaming competition 
significant negative changes resulting from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our property and equipment and or our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by competition and legislative changes are included in item f and g  respectively  in this form k 
for our business insurance renewals in and  we assumed more risk than in the prior years  primarily through higher retentions and higher maximum losses for stop loss insurance for certain coverages 
our march  business insurance renewals included substantially the same coverages and retentions as in previous years 
based on our historical loss experience  management does not anticipate that this increased risk assumption will materially impact our results of operations 
our ability to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs in future years under terms and conditions comparable to the current years is uncertain 
during  we reduced the carrying value of the buildings  equipment and furniture and fixtures of ellis park to reflect their estimated fair value in a divestiture transaction 
management reassessed the carrying value of ellis park as of december  and determined no additional impairment was necessary 
management expects to restore ellis park s profitability through reduced expenses and a new racing schedule for should the company s plans to meet expected operating results at ellis park not be realized  an additional write down of these assets could occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had million of total debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and senior note facility  which bear interest at libor based variable rates 
we are exposed to market risk on variable rate debt due to potential adverse changes in the libor rate 
assuming the outstanding balance on the debt facilities remains constant  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would reduce annual pre tax earnings  recorded fair value and cash flows by million 
in order to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with our variable rate debt  we entered into interest rate swap contracts with major financial institutions during march under terms of the contracts we received a libor based variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate on notional amounts totaling million 
assuming the december   notional amounts under the interest rate swap contracts remain constant  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would increase annual pre tax earnings and cash flows by million
