the residual effects of the liberty agreement will continue to decrease onebeacon s earned insurance premiums in however  this decrease is expected to be more than offset by new premiums generated as a result of the atlantic mutual transaction 
total revenues in were also impacted by decreased net investment income due to the runoff of loss reserves from onebeacon s non core business as well as the reduced interest rate environment 
the decline in total revenues in was partially offset by an increase in other revenues  primarily as a result of million in gains recorded during related to the sale of several real estate properties previously written off under purchase accounting for onebeacon and a million increase in over in fees and commissions for business placed by wmu

also contributing to the decrease in expenses was a decrease in the accretion of the fair value adjustment to the reserves acquired as part of the onebeacon acquisition 
this accretion will continue to decrease as those acquired reserves are paid over time 
partially offsetting these expense decreases was an increase in general and administrative expense of million in over this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to share based compensation expense at the holding company level  as a result of the run up in the market price of common shares over the year resulting from the above target performance of white mountains in white mountains expenses its full cost of all incentive compensation programs

also contributing to the decrease were declines in written premium relating to the transfer of onebeacon s private passenger automobile business in new jersey to new jersey skylands insurance association in and lower premiums at autoone insurance  offset partially by increased writings from esurance 
autoone insurance s written premium volume was lower in primarily as a result of lower assignments from the nyaip  partially offset by the sale of takeout credits under the nyaip s credit programs 
onebeacon s core personal lines expenses for include the impact of a million reduction in a liability for new york assigned risks  which reduced the core personal lines combined ratio by points for the release of this liability resulted from changes in the new york assigned risk market  including a depopulation of the assigned risk pool and favorable revisions to the structure of credit programs

additionally  onebeacon continued to shift away from certain classes of risks within its business lines that have historically been less profitable  such as contractors  transportation and non durable wholesalers  to more profitable industry segments  such as service providers  retailers and light manufacturers 
the improvement was mitigated by adverse development on prior year reserves of million in connection with the run off of old workers compensation and contractor business  which added points to the commercial lines combined ratio for onebeacon s core commercial lines written premium volume for decreased from  primarily due to the continued effects of actions taken to reduce the concentration of risks subject to terrorism  such as reducing total insured values in major cities  and reductions in workers compensation writings 
management has been pleased with the changes that it has implemented in onebeacon s commercial lines business since the onebeacon acquisition and is now beginning to shift its focus from shrinking the business to profitable growth

written premiums for non core operations were million in  a decrease of compared to  as written premiums on business subject to the liberty agreement decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due primarily to the change in onebeacon s share of the underwriting results under the liberty agreement from two thirds to one third and also a decline in renewals of policies subject to the liberty agreement 
as further described below  non core results also included prior accident year reserve development of million during  of which million related to construction defect claims which emerged from commercial multiple peril and general liability coverages written in the s and million related to a significant property claim from a pool in which onebeacon had participated the industrial risk insurers pool that was settled through an arbitration decision during pursuant to the liberty agreement  liberty mutual assumed control of onebeacon s claims offices in the regions subject to the liberty agreement and was responsible for servicing claims from the onebeacon policies written prior to november   as well as policies which renewed in those regions since that date 
as previously discussed  effective july   the servicing agreement with liberty mutual was amended and onebeacon took back substantially all remaining outstanding claims related to policies written prior to the liberty agreement 
during the second quarter of  onebeacon claims and actuarial personnel noticed an unusual spike in case reserves related to the policies taken back from liberty mutual 
as a result  onebeacon claims and actuarial personnel undertook a study to determine the cause of the increase 
this study  which was completed in the third quarter of  indicated that most of the increase in activity was due to differences in case reserving philosophies between onebeacon s and liberty s claims adjusters  such as the identification and coding of construction defect claims

as a result  onebeacon achieved price increases of and in automobile and homeowners  respectively  during  compared with increases of and in onebeacon s personal lines written premium volume from core operations for increased as compared to all of due primarily to new business produced by autoone insurance 
excluding autoone insurance written premium and lad servicing fees  written premium volume decreased from written premium for all of this decrease was due to actions to reduce exposure to windstorms on property located in coastal areas  a decision to reduce exposure to the private passenger automobile business in massachusetts due to unfavorable market conditions and the formation of a reciprocal insurance carrier in new jersey

the increases in net written and earned premiums were due to increased pricing on folksamerica s expiring and renewed contracts  increased shares on renewed contacts and new contracts resulting from the increased demand of reinsurance buyers for placing reinsurance with responsible  well capitalized reinsurers 
folksamerica expects that favorable terms and conditions will continue in most classes of business  however  increasing competition may begin to adversely impact the current favorable environment

as a result of the renewal rights agreement with cna re  folksamerica entered into reinsurance contracts that resulted in written premiums of approximately million through january  these premiums will be recorded as revenue as they are earned 
folksamerica results year ended december  versus year ended december  folksamerica s gaap combined ratio improved to for  from for which included twelve points of catastrophe losses  including approximately six points as a result of the attacks 
the gaap combined ratio for included three points of catastrophe losses  mainly due to million of additional losses related to the attacks and million of net incurred losses related to european floods during the third quarter of aside from the lower level of incurred catastrophe losses  the improvement in folksamerica s results was attributable to the continuing positive trends in reinsurance pricing  terms and conditions that began before  and became more dramatic after  the attacks

these losses  with exception of the those relating to the attacks  were covered under the imagine cover  and were partially offset by amortization of the deferred gain related to retroactive reinsurance see below 
during  folksamerica recorded gross losses from the attacks of approximately million  or approximately million net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement costs 
this loss represented approximately six points of its gaap combined ratio 
folksamerica also established a reserve of million for enron related surety exposures in folksamerica s losses and lae included million in losses related to prior accident years representing i higher than expected reported losses in folksamerica s property excess line and ii an increase in reserves related to losses arising from the portfolios acquired from the usf re and risk capital

however  for purposes of this presentation  this realized gain is not included in fund american re s pretax earnings  but is included in this consolidated presentation of white mountains investment in montpelier 
as of december   montpelier s shareholders equity totalled approximately billion versus billion as of december  montpelier wrote net premiums of million and had total earned premiums of million in  compared to million and million  respectively  for during  montpelier reported net income of million  with comprehensive net income of million  compared to million and million  respectively  for montpelier s reported return on equity on a diluted basis was and its gaap combined ratio was  compared to and  respectively  for a large portion of montpelier s business is global specialty property reinsurance which has large aggregate exposures to natural and man made disasters 
as such  management expects that montpelier s claim experience from this business will be the result of relatively few claims of high magnitude 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in  and could have a material adverse effect on  montpelier s financial condition and results and their ability to write new business

the international american group contributed 
million of pretax losses for  compared to million and million in and during the periods presented  peninsula was the only active company in the group  and therefore it accounts for all of the premiums reported in the tables above 
during january of  white mountains sold peninsula for million 
the operations of american centennial and british insurance company are not significant to white mountains  as those companies have been in run off since they were acquired in holding company and financing activities

general and administrative expenses at the holding companies consist primarily of compensation expenses of holding company employees  including share based expense related to outstanding performance shares  options and restricted shares see note 
compensation expense at the holding companies increased to million in  from million in and 
million in the majority of this increase is due to million of performance share expense recognized at the holding companies in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in performance share expense in was due to many factors  including i the increase in the per share market value of common shares at december   compared to and at december  and  ii the exceptional performance of the company and its operating subsidiaries in relation to performance targets in  iii the inclusion of the expenses of wm advisors in the holding companies in previously white mountains investment advisory services had been performed through onebeacon and iv the accelerated recognition of expense related to the early termination of performance shares previously issued to certain non management directors in light of the proposed independence standards for directors 
the million decrease in interest expense at the holding companies from to resulted primarily from the absence in of the million seller note  which was fully repaid by white mountains in november  as well as a reduced level of bank debt outstanding and at a reduced rate as a result of issuing the senior notes to repay the old bank facility 
through the issuance of the senior notes  white mountains reduced the interest rate on the majority of its outstanding debt to from approximately on the old bank facility after giving effect to interest rate swaps 
during  white mountains recorded million of interest expense on the senior notes 
interest expense on the old bank facility was million in  versus million and million for and interest expense from the seller note increased from million in to million in as declining interest rates partially offset the effect of four additional months of interest in during  white mountains adopted the presentation provisions of sfas no

as a result  white mountains reclassified its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock from mezzanine equity to liabilities on its balance sheet 
also under sfas  beginning in the third quarter of  white mountains began presenting all accretion and dividends on its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as interest expense 
white mountains recorded million of such interest expense for the six months ended december  in addition to recording million of dividends and accretion for the six months ending june  prior to its adoption of sfas in connection with purchase accounting for the onebeacon acquisition  white mountains was required to adjust to fair value onebeacon s loss and lae reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables by million and million  respectively  on onebeacon s balance sheet at june  this net reduction to loss and lae reserves of million is being accreted through an income statement charge ratably with and over the period that the claims are expected to be settled 
as a result  white mountains recognized million  million and million of accretion to loss and lae reserves during  and  respectively 
white mountains will accrete the remaining million over the future periods in which the claims are settled  which is expected to be seven or eight years from the onebeacon acquisition

summary of investment operations overview white mountains manages all of its consolidated investments through its wholly owned subsidiary  wm advisors 
white mountains investment philosophy is to invest its assets with a view towards maximizing its after tax total return over extended periods of time 
under this approach  each dollar of after tax investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses is valued equally 
white mountains seeks to maximize risk adjusted returns over the long term 
white mountains overall fixed maturity investment strategy is to purchase securities that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risks 
white mountains generally manages the interest rate risk associated with holding fixed maturity investments by actively monitoring and maintaining the average duration of the portfolio with the goal of achieving an adequate after tax total return without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk 
white mountains investment portfolio mix as of december  was focused on capital preservation and consisted in large part of high quality  fixed maturity investments and short term investments 
results white mountains was pleased with its overall investment results during  as its fixed maturity portfolios achieved positive returns while generally avoiding credit problems and its equity portfolio generated strong returns in  despite its conservative value approach and use of convertibles 
in addition  one off investments montpelier  etc 
that round out white mountains equity investment exposure moved sharply higher in positive results generated by white mountains equity portfolios in reflected the strong stock market 
convertible securities  which are part of the equity portfolios  also provided good returns although considerably below the common equities 
as often happens when equity markets soar  convertibles are retired 
white mountains portfolio lost a number of large positions this way in  although replacements are currently being sought 
white mountains corporate bond portfolio posted strong results in  reflecting successful credit work and portfolio management 
this portfolio s duration was reduced from to years during  while total fixed income portfolio duration went from to years 
while shrinking both the corporate bond portfolio s size and duration  wm advisors sought to upgrade the potential return of holdings relative to their default and downgrade risk 
white mountains reduced the mortgage and asset backed securities portfolio in size  duration and convexity risk a measure of exposure to changes in value from interest rate movements in positive returns this past year were earned with a lower risk profile than the overall securitized market  a market wm advisors considers generally unattractive since it contains both material extension risk and prepayment risk 
white mountains total return on its investment portfolio for the years ended december   and appear below 
the amount of pretax investment return included in net income loss follows year ended december  millions net investment income  pre tax net realized investment gains  pre tax total pretax investment return included in net income loss white mountains total return also includes changes in net unrealized gains  which are reported net of tax as a separate component of common shareholders equity and included in comprehensive net income loss 
the amount of investment return  after tax  resulting from changes in net unrealized gains follows year ended december  millions change in net unrealized investment gains  after tax white mountains net investment income is comprised primarily of interest income associated with its substantial portfolio of fixed maturity investments and dividend income from its equity investments 
the decrease in investment income in from was due primarily to lower interest rates throughout the financial markets and lower average net invested assets in onebeacon s investment portfolio as it gradually shrunk with the run off of onebeacon s non core book 
the significant increase in investment income from to was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of investment income generated by onebeacon s assets in the results as compared to the seven months of onebeacon s post acquisition investment activity included in the results 
white mountains realized investment gains and losses result principally from sales of fixed maturity investments and to a lesser extent common equity securities 
the investment gains realized in reflect sales of mortgage backed securities to reduce the duration of the bond portfolio 
also included in net realized investment gains are amounts recognized under sfas related to changes in the fair value of the montpelier warrants gain of million for versus a gain of million in and fund american s interest rate swap agreements loss of million for versus losses of million and million during and 
during  white mountains net increase in after tax unrealized investment gains was principally the result of significant gains in the equity market 
during  white mountains net increase in after tax unrealized investment gains was principally the result of significant decreases in market interest rates 
during  the net decrease in after tax net unrealized gains for investments resulted principally from the realization of gains as a result of white mountains s sale of a large portion of its fixed maturity investment portfolio 
impairment temporary losses on investment securities are recorded as unrealized losses 
temporary losses do not impact net income and earnings per common share but serve to reduce comprehensive net income  shareholders equity and tangible book value 
unrealized losses subsequently identified as other than temporary impairments are recorded as realized losses 
other than temporary impairments previously recorded as unrealized losses do not impact comprehensive net income  shareholders equity and tangible book value but serve to reduce net income and earnings per common share 
white mountains methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific facts and circumstances as of the balance sheet date 
as a result  subsequent adverse changes in an issuers credit quality or subsequent weakening of market conditions that differ from expectations could result in additional other than temporary impairments 
in addition  the sale of a fixed maturity security with a previously recorded unrealized loss would result in a realized loss 
either of these situations would adversely impact net income and earnings per common share but would not impact comprehensive net income  shareholders equity or tangible book value 
the following table presents an analysis of the continuous periods during which white mountains has held investment positions which were carried at an unrealized loss as of december  excluding short term investments december  in millions months months months total fixed maturity investments number of positions market value amortized cost unrealized loss common equity securities number of positions market value amortized cost unrealized loss other investments number of positions market value amortized cost unrealized loss total number of positions market value amortized cost unrealized loss of total gross unrealized losses during the year ended december   white mountains experienced million in pre tax  other than temporary impairment charges  comprised of million taken on equity securities  million on preferred stocks and million on several limited partnership investments included in other long term investments 
of the charge taken on equity securities  million was related to white mountains investment in the common stock of octel corp octel and the remaining million related to three other equity positions  none of which were individually significant 
white mountains recorded the other than temporary impairments primarily due to the fact that the unrealized loss position on these securities was greater than of white mountains cost over the previous six month period and also that certain factors have been reported by those companies which affect the likelihood that white mountains will recover the original cost of its investment 
during  white mountains experienced million in pretax other than temporary impairment charges 
of the charge recorded in  million related to white mountains investment in insurance partners and million was related to its investment in the conning connecticut insurance fund 
both of these investments are limited partnerships that are carried in other investments in white mountains consolidated balance sheet 
white mountains did not experience any other material impairment charges relating to any other individual investment security during the three years ended december  white mountains believes that the gross unrealized losses relating to its fixed maturity investments at december  resulted primarily from increases in market interest rates from the dates that certain investments within that portfolio were acquired as opposed to fundamental changes in the credit quality of the issuers of such securities 
therefore  these decreases in value are viewed as being temporary because white mountains has the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
white mountains also believes that the gross unrealized losses recorded on its common equity securities and its other investments at december  resulted primarily from decreases in quoted market values from the dates that certain investments securities within that portfolio were acquired as opposed to fundamental changes in the issuer s financial performance and near term financial prospects 
therefore  these decreases are also viewed as being temporary 
however  due to the inherent risk involved in investing in the equity markets  it is possible that the decrease in market value of these investments may ultimately prove to be other than temporary 
as of december   white mountains investment portfolio did not include any investment securities with an after tax unrealized loss of more than million

fully converted tangible book value per share is derived by expanding the book value per share calculation to include i the effects of assumed conversion of all convertible securities and ii any remaining unamortized goodwill or deferred credits as of the applicable date 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash  short term investments and insurance float white mountains consolidated sources of cash consist primarily of premium collections  net investment income  financing activities and proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities 
white mountains consolidated uses of cash are primarily claim payments  operating expenses  financing costs and the purchase of investment securities 
the primary sources of cash inflows for the company and certain of its intermediate holding companies are dividends and tax sharing payments received from the operating subsidiaries 
under the insurance laws of the states and jurisdictions under which white mountains domestic insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance regarding the amount of such dividends that may be paid by such subsidiaries in the future 
in  onebeacon s first tier insurance subsidiaries have the ability to pay dividends of approximately million to fund american without approval of regulatory authorities 
as a result of the liberty agreement  premium collections and claim payments at onebeacon have been declining steadily over the past two years as onebeacon assumed approximately two thirds of the operating results from renewals through october  and approximately one third of the operating results from renewals from november  to october  onebeacon will continue to run off the claims on business transferred to liberty mutual but will no longer participate in future policy renewals 
therefore  onebeacon will need to periodically liquidate invested assets to fund the payment of these claims and will manage its short term liquidity needs accordingly 
both internal and external forces influence white mountains financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to white mountains and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
management believes that white mountains cash balances  cash flows from operations  routine sales of investments and the liquidity provided by the new bank facility are adequate to meet expected cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
insurance float is an important dynamic of white mountains operations that must be managed effectively 
float is money that an insurance company holds for a limited time 
in an insurance operation  float arises because premiums are collected before losses are paid 
this interval can extend over many years 
during that time  the insurer invests the money 
when the premiums that an insurer collects do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay the result is an underwriting loss  which is considered to be the cost of float 
the amount and cost of float for white mountains is affected by underlying market conditions  as well as acquisitions or dispositions of insurance and reinsurance businesses 
although insurance float can be calculated using numbers determined under gaap  insurance float is not a gaap concept and therefore there is no comparable gaap measure 
for each of the years in the three year period ending december   the company has had negative cash flows from operations but has generated significant float from its insurance and reinsurance operations 
the company s cash flow from operations does not include float generated by the acquisition of insurance and reinsurance businesses in recent years 
post acquisition  such companies are often placed into partial or complete run off  thereby resulting in negative cash flows from operations as the investment portfolios acquired are liquidated over time to pay claims 
white mountains expects that it will continue to have negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future but expects float to increase  particularly in light of the pending sirius insurance group and sierra group acquisitions 
one of the means by which white mountains calculates its insurance float is by taking its net investment assets and subtracting its total capital 
the following table illustrates white mountains consolidated insurance float position for the past four years year ended december  in millions total investments cash investments in unconsolidated insurance affiliates accounts receivable on unsettled investment sales accounts payable on unsettled investment purchases net investment assets total common shareholders equity debt preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption convertible preference shares deferred credits total capital insurance float insurance float as a multiple of total capital x x x x net investment assets as a multiple of total capital x x x x insurance float as a multiple of shareholders equity x x x x net investment assets as a multiple of shareholders equity x x x x white mountains has historically obtained its float primarily through acquisitions  as opposed to organic growth 
in the case of onebeacon  the substantial amount of float initially acquired with the onebeacon acquisition has shrunk as a result of onebeacon s re underwriting efforts and the effects of the liberty agreement 
onebeacon s float is expected to continue to shrink over the next few years as older  long tailed loss reserves are paid and are not replaced with the same level of new writings as those written in the past 
in the case of folksamerica  its float is expected to gradually increase in the next few years as a result of higher premium writings as a result of its increase in capital base over the past two years 
it is white mountains intention to generate low cost float over time through a combination of acquisitions and or by organic growth in its existing insurance and reinsurance operations  but only when market conditions indicate a high likelihood of generating underwriting profits 
financing the following table summarizes white mountains capital structure as of december  and millions december  december  senior notes  carrying value new bank facility old bank facility other debt total debt preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption convertible preference shares common shareholders equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization undrawn million revolving facility 
management believes that white mountains strong financial position provides it with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally as needed through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis 
white mountains has recently enhanced its access to the capital markets by having a shelf registration declared effective by the sec in july for offerings of up to billion in debt and or equity securities 
contractual obligations and commitments below is a schedule of white mountains material contractual obligations and commitments as of december  millions due in one year or less due in two to three years due in four to five years due after five years total debt mandatorily redeemable preferred stock operating leases total contractual obligations white mountains also has future binding commitments to fund certain limited partnership investments 
these commitments  which total approximately million  do not have fixed funding dates and are therefore excluded from the table above 
in may  white mountains reduced its cost of capital and significantly reduced its near term obligations by fully prepaying its million amortizing old bank facility principally through the net proceeds from the issuance of million face value of year  fixed rate senior notes  which were issued by fund american in a public offering 
the senior notes  which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the company  bear a fixed interest rate of 
the interest rate on million of the previous old bank facility was  after giving effect to a series of interest rate swap agreements 
fund american unwound these swap agreements immediately following the old bank facility prepayment by paying consideration of million in cash 
fund american s senior notes are currently rated baa adequate  the th highest of ratings by moody s investor services moody s and bbb adequate  the th highest of ratings by s p 
both moody s and s p affirmed their senior debt ratings for fund american following the company s announcement of its plans to acquire the sirius insurance group and both agencies reported that the outlook for their ratings remain stable 
it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may reduce white mountains existing ratings 
if one or more of its ratings were downgraded  white mountains could incur higher borrowing costs and its ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
in addition  white mountains insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in its financial strength ratings  including a possible reduction in demand for its products in certain markets 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture which contains restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company  fund american and their respective subsidiaries to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and substantially limits the ability of fund american and its respective subsidiaries to consolidate  merge or transfer its properties and assets 
the indenture does not contain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity to which the company or fund american must adhere 
in september  fund american terminated the old bank facility  which then consisted solely of an undrawn million revolving credit line  and replaced it with a new million revolving credit facility  which matures in september and under which both fund american and the company are permitted borrowers 
under the new credit facility  the company guarantees all obligations of fund american  and fund american guarantees all borrowings of the company subject to certain limitations imposed by the terms of the berkshire preferred stock 
as of december   the new bank facility was undrawn 
the new bank facility contains various affirmative  negative and financial covenants which white mountains considers to be customary for such borrowings and include maintaining certain minimum net worth and maximum debt to capitalization standards for white mountains 
failure to meet one or more of these covenants could result in an event of default  which ultimately could result in acceleration of principal repayment 
at december   white mountains was in compliance with all of the covenants under the new bank facility  and anticipates it will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future 
on december   white mountains entered into a definitive agreement with abb to acquire the sirius insurance group at a purchase price of sek billion approximately us million  subject to a kronor for kronor adjustment to the extent that the total tangible shareholders equity value of the acquired companies as of december  is greater or less than sek billion approximately us million 
white mountains has the existing capital to finance this acquisition through either cash on hand or availability under the new credit facility 
because the ultimate purchase price is payable in swedish kronor  white mountains purchased sek billion for usd million on december  subsequently invested in short term swedish treasury bills to ensure that it held enough swedish currency in the proper holding company to close the transaction  which white mountains expects to occur in the second quarter of in december  folksamerica entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the sierra group  consisting of california indemnity insurance company and its three subsidiaries  from nevada based sierra health services  inc under the terms of the agreement  folksamerica will pay million  which includes million in cash and a million purchase note  of which million will be adjusted over its six year term to reflect favorable or adverse loss reserve development on the acquired reserve portfolio and runoff of remaining policies in force as well as certain other balance sheet protections 
the acquired companies historical net assets at december  were approximately million 
white mountains expects the transaction to close in the first or second quarter of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
in june  white mountains sold vgi to unitrin  inc unitrin the vgi sale 
as part of the vgi sale  white mountains has provided unitrin with adverse loss development protection of up to million on loss reserves sold to unitrin 
unitrin has made a demand for the full million

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial statements presented herein include all adjustments considered necessary by management to fairly present the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of white mountains 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in the current year presentation of financial information  certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation 
white mountains has completed numerous significant transactions during the periods presented that have affected the comparability of the financial statement information presented herein 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to loss and lae reserves  purchase accounting and related deferred credits and goodwill  reinsurance transactions and its pension benefit obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that its critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
loss and loss adjustment expenses insurance white mountains insurance subsidiaries establish loss and lae that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
reinsurance is an arrangement in which a reinsurance company a reinsurer contractually agrees to indemnify an insurance company for all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the insurance company 
white mountains establishes estimates of amounts recoverable from its reinsurers in a manner consistent with the claim liability covered by the reinsurance contracts  net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
net insurance loss reserves represent loss and lae reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 
in a broad sense  loss and lae reserves have two components i case reserves  which are reserves established within the claims function for claims that have been reported to white mountains and ii ibnr 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim 
white mountains claims staff periodically adjusts case reserves as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
generally accepted actuarial methods are used to project estimates of ibnr 
actuaries use a variety of statistical and analytical methods to determine estimates of ibnr  which are based  in part  on historical claim reporting and payment patterns 
in estimating ibnr  actuaries consider all available information  including historical experience  changes in business mix  coverage limits  changes in claims handling practices  pricing  reinsurance protections  inflation and the effects of legal  social and legislative trends on future claim payments 
management exercises judgment based upon its knowledge of its business  review of the outcome of actuarial studies  historical experience and other factors to record an estimate it believes reflects white mountains expected ultimate unpaid loss and lae and related reinsurance recoverables 
regardless of the techniques used  estimation is inherent in the process of establishing unpaid loss reserves and related reinsurance recoverables as of any given date 
uncertainties in projecting ultimate claim amounts are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it becomes reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short 
the claim tail for liability coverages  such as general and product liability  directors and officers liability  medical malpractice and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported or settled years after the related occurrences 
during the claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding claims and trends become known which may cause white mountains to adjust its estimate of its ultimate net loss and lae liability 
loss and lae reserve estimates at onebeacon are subject to additional uncertainty as a consequence of numerous factors that occurred prior to white mountains acquisition of onebeacon on june  as previously discussed  onebeacon is the result of the merger of the us operations of general accident and commercial union  two companies with different underwriting and claims management philosophies and practices 
beginning in the mid s  and continuing through the cgu merger  the subsequent operational integration of general accident plc and commercial union plc and the onebeacon acquisition  onebeacon experienced an environment of significant change  both in its business and operations 
generally accepted actuarial techniques used to estimate reserves rely in large degree on projecting historical trends such as patterns of claim development ie  reported claims and paid losses into the future 
accordingly  estimating reserves becomes more uncertain if business mix  case reserve adequacy  claims payment rates  coverage limits and other factors change over time 
the breadth and depth of the business and operational changes that occurred at onebeacon led to a wider range in the reserve estimates produced by a variety of actuarial loss reserving techniques  especially those that rely upon consistent claim development patterns  and introduced greater complexity to the judgments required to be made by management in determining the impact of the business and operational changes on the development patterns used to estimate reserves 
onebeacon s net loss and lae reserves by line of business at december  and were as follows onebeacon net loss and lae reserves by line of business december  in millions workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total onebeacon s actuaries use several generally accepted actuarial methods to evaluate its loss reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
onebeacon places more or less reliance on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the reserve estimates are made 
these methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories historical paid loss development methods these methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical paid loss development methods assume that the ratio of losses paid in one period to losses paid in an earlier period will remain constant 
these methods necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as inflation or the effects of litigation  will remain constant in the future 
because historical paid loss development methods do not use case reserves to estimate ultimate losses  they can be more reliable than the other methods discussed below that look to case reserves such as actuarial methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how case reserves are established by a company s claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 
historical incurred loss development methods these methods  like historical paid loss development methods  assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future 
however  instead of using paid losses  these methods use incurred losses ie  the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical incurred loss development methods can be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims 
however  historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time 
therefore  when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established  using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses can be less reliable than other methods 
expected loss ratio methods these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
expected loss ratios are typically developed based upon the information used in pricing  and are multiplied by the total amount of premiums written to calculate ultimate losses 
expected loss ratio methods are particularly useful for estimating ultimate losses in the early years of long tailed lines of business  when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation  the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change  provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes 
for onebeacon  the range of reserve estimates at december  was evaluated to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the actuarial methods applied against onebeacon s historical claims experience data 
the following table shows the recorded reserves and the high and low ends of onebeacon s range of reasonable loss reserve estimates at december  the high and low ends of onebeacon s range of reserve estimates in the table below are based on the results of various actuarial methods described above 
the recorded reserve for each line is the result of the actuarial method that management believes to be most appropriate based on known facts and trends 
onebeacon net loss and lae reserves by line of business range and recorded reserves december  in millions low recorded high workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total the probability that ultimate losses will fall outside of the ranges of estimates by line of business is higher for each line of business individually than it is for the sum of the estimates for all lines taken together due to the effects of diversification 
although management believes onebeacon s reserves are reasonably stated  ultimate losses may deviate  perhaps materially  from the recorded reserve amounts and could be above the high end of the range of actuarial projections 
further adverse development  if any  would impact onebeacon s future results of operations 
for further discussion of onebeacon s loss and lae  see loss and loss adjustment expense reserves within the onebeacon section of item and i 
summary of operations by segment in item of this report 
management believes that the recorded reserves represent its best estimate of unpaid loss and lae by line of business 
in its selection of recorded reserves  management has generally given greater weight to adjusted paid loss development methods  which are not dependent on the consistency of case reserving practices  rather than methods that rely on incurred losses  because of the increased adequacy of case reserving by onebeacon s claim staff in the recent past 
in particular  for multiple peril and general liability  this resulted in onebeacon recording reserves at or near the low end of the range 
for some types of claims  such as workers compensation and construction defect  management also considered special purpose forecasting models that its claims and actuarial staff have created that consider the unique loss development characteristics of these types of claims 
onebeacon a e reserves immediately prior to white mountains acquisition of onebeacon  onebeacon purchased a reinsurance contract with nico under which onebeacon is entitled to recover from nico up to billion in the future for asbestos claims arising from business written by onebeacon in and prior  environmental claims arising from business written by onebeacon in and prior  and certain other exposures 
under the terms of the nico cover  nico receives the economic benefit of third party recoverables in existence at the time the nico cover was executed 
as a result  the third party recoverables serve to protect the billion limit of nico coverage for the benefit of onebeacon 
any amounts uncollectible from third party reinsurers due to dispute or the reinsurers financial inability to pay are covered by nico under its agreement with onebeacon 
onebeacon estimates that on an incurred basis it has exhausted approximately billion of the coverage provided by nico at december  due to the inherent difficulties in estimating ultimate a e exposures  onebeacon does not estimate a range for these incurred losses 
approximately million of the estimated billion of incurred losses have been paid by nico through december   with million paid in the estimate of incurred losses represents management s best estimate  based on information currently available  of its ultimate liabilities that it is entitled to recover under the nico cover 
accordingly  onebeacon believes the nico cover will be adequate to cover all of its a e obligations 
however  as case law expands  medical and clean up costs increase and industry settlement practices change  onebeacon may be subject to asbestos and environmental losses beyond currently estimated amounts 
therefore  onebeacon cannot guarantee that its remaining coverage under the nico cover will be sufficient to cover additional liability arising from any such unfavorable developments 
onebeacon s a e liabilities have resulted primarily from the operations of the employers group  an entity acquired by one of the legacy companies in these operations provided primary and excess liability insurance for commercial insureds  including fortune sized accounts  some of whom subsequently experienced claims for a e losses 
employers group stopped writing such coverage in onebeacon s liabilities for a e losses from business underwritten in the recent past are substantially limited by the application of exclusionary clauses in the policy language that eliminated coverage of such claims 
after for pollution and for asbestos  most liability policies contained industry standard absolute exclusions of such claims 
in earlier years  various exclusions were also applied  but the wording of those exclusions was less strict and subsequent court rulings have reduced their effectiveness 
onebeacon also incurred a e losses via its participation in industry pools and associations 
the most significant of these pools was ecra  which provided excess liability reinsurance to us insurers from until the early s 
ecra incurred significant liabilities for a e  of which onebeacon bears approximately a share  or million at december  compared to million at december   which is fully reflected in onebeacon s loss and lae reserves 
more recently  since the s  onebeacon has experienced an influx of claims from commercial insureds  including many non fortune sized accounts written during the s and s  who are named as defendants in asbestos lawsuits 
as a number of large well known manufacturers of asbestos and asbestos containing products have gone into bankruptcy  plaintiffs have sought recoveries from peripheral defendants  such as installers  transporters or sellers of such products  or from owners of premises on which exposure to asbestos allegedly occurred 
historically  most asbestos claims have been asserted as product liability claims 
recently  insureds who have exhausted the available products liability limits of their insurance policies have sought payment for asbestos claims under the premises and operations coverage of their liability policies 
it is more difficult for plaintiffs to establish losses as stemming from premises and operations exposures  which requires proof of the defendant s negligence  rather than products liability under which strict legal liability applies 
hence  there are fewer of such claims for which there is a great deal of variation in payments for actual injuries 
additionally  several accounts that seek such coverage find that previously paid losses were subject to product liability and operations aggregate limits that were previously exhausted 
there are currently active claims against onebeacon without product liability coverage asserting operations or premises coverage 
for purposes of determining available third party recoverables  product liability asbestos claims typically are aggregated as a single loss within each policy period 
as a result  losses often exceed the threshold level under the reinsurance agreement and reinsurance recoveries are obtained 
however  for claims being asserted under premises and operations coverage  the losses are generally not aggregated for purposes of determining reinsurance recoveries  so onebeacon expects that in the future a smaller percentage of these losses will be covered as third party recoverables than has been true historically of products liability asbestos losses 
the cost of administering a e claims  which is an important factor in estimating loss reserves  tends to be higher than in the case of non a e claims due to the higher legal costs typically associated with a e claims

white mountains reinsurance subsidiaries also obtain reinsurance whereby another reinsurer contractually agrees to indemnify white mountains for all or a portion of the reinsurance risks underwritten by white mountains 
such arrangements  where one reinsurer provides reinsurance to another reinsurer  are usually referred to as retrocessional reinsurance arrangements 
white mountains establishes estimates of amounts recoverable from retrocessional reinsurance in a manner consistent with the loss and lae liability associated with reinsurance contracts offered to its customers the ceding companies  net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
net reinsurance loss reserves represent loss and lae reserves reduced by retrocessional reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 
reinsurance loss and lae reserve estimates reflect the judgment of both the ceding companies and white mountains  based on the experience and knowledge of their respective claims personnel  regarding the nature and value of the claims 
the ceding companies may periodically adjust the amount of the case reserves as additional information becomes known or partial payments are made 
upon notification of a loss from a ceding company  white mountains establishes case reserves  including lae reserves  based upon white mountains share of the amount of reserves established by the ceding company and white mountains independent evaluation of the loss 
in cases where available information indicates that reserves established by the ceding company are inadequate  white mountains establishes reserves in excess of its share of the reserves established by the ceding company 
the estimation of net reinsurance loss and lae reserves is subject to the same factors as the estimation of insurance loss and lae reserves 
in addition to those factors which give rise to inherent uncertainties in establishing insurance loss and lae reserves  the claim tail for reinsurers is further extended because claims are first reported through one or more intermediary insurers or reinsurers 
white mountains net loss and lae reserves for its reinsurance segment by class of business at december  and were as follows net loss and lae reserves by class of business december  in millions liability excluding a e property a e accident health and other fund american re total white mountains establishes loss reserves for its reinsurance segment based on a single point estimate  which is management s best estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
this best estimate is derived from a combination of methods 
for current accident year business the estimate is based on an expected loss ratio method 
the parameters underlying this method are developed during the underwriting and pricing process 
loss ratio expectations are derived for each contract and these are aggregated by class of business and type of contract 
these loss ratios are then applied to the actual earned premiums by class and type of business to estimate ultimate losses 
paid losses are deducted to determine loss and loss expense reserves 
for prior accident years  white mountains reinsurance segment gradually replaces this expected loss ratio approach with estimates based on historical loss reporting patterns 
for both current and prior accident years estimates change when new information becomes available  such as changing loss emergence patterns  or claim and underwriting audits 
once a point estimate is established  in the case of folksamerica  actuaries estimate loss reserve ranges to measure the sensitivity of the actuarial assumptions used to set the point estimates 
these ranges are calculated using similar methods to the point estimate calculation  but with different expected loss ratio and loss reporting pattern assumptions 
for the low estimate  more optimistic loss ratios and faster reporting patterns are assumed  while the high estimate uses more conservative loss ratios and slower reporting patterns 
these variable assumptions are derived from historic variations in loss ratios and reporting patterns by class and type of business 
due to the inherent difficulties in estimating ultimate a e exposures  folksamerica does not estimate ranges of these reserves 
in addition  fund american re does not estimate a range for its reserves 
the following table illustrates white mountains recorded net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for its reinsurance segment  and high and low estimates for those classes of business for which a range is calculated  at december  net loss and lae reserves by class of business december  in millions low recorded high liability excluding a e property accident health and other sub total a e fund american re total the probability that ultimate losses will fall outside of the ranges of estimates by class of business is higher for each class of business individually than it is for the sum of the estimates for all classes taken together due to the effects of diversification

further adverse development  if any  would impact future results of operations of the reinsurance segment

reinsurance segment a e reserves folksamerica has a specialized unit that handles claims emanating from a e exposures 
the issues presented by these types of claims require specialization  expertise and an awareness of the various trends and jurisdictional developments 
folksamerica s a e exposure is primarily from reinsurance contracts written between through by predecessor companies mony reinsurance and christiania general 
the exposures are predominately higher layer excess of loss treaty and facultative coverages with relatively low limits exposed for each claim 
net incurred loss activity for asbestos and environmental in the last two years was as follows net incurred loss and lae activity december  in millions asbestos environmental total in recent years  most of folksamerica s reported activity in the asbestos area has related to higher layer excess policies that are being reached by larger target defendants  new notices for smaller regional defendants that are now exposed because of the larger defendant bankruptcies  and new notices on premises and non products cases  where coverage is being sought by insureds against the non aggregating portion of the underlying policy 
concerning this third point  many of these types of claims will not impact folksamerica s layers of coverage due to high attachment points and the contractual requirement of multiple retentions for these type of claims 
approximately million of folksamerica s loss development for asbestos exposures was a bulk increase in ibnr resulting from the completion of a detailed a e market share study 
this study compared folksamerica s share of industry paid losses to estimated industry carried reserves 
folksamerica sets up claim files for each reported claim by each cedent for each individual insured 
in many instances  a single claim notification from a cedent could involve several years and layers of coverage resulting in a file being set up for each involvement 
precautionary claim notices are submitted by the ceding companies in order to preserve their right to pursue coverage under the reinsurance contract 
such notices do not contain an incurred loss amount to folksamerica  accordingly  an open claim file is not established 
as of december   folksamerica had approximately  open claim files for asbestos and open claim files for environmental exposures 
the costs associated with administering the underlying a e claims by folksamerica s clients tend to be higher than non a e claims due to generally higher legal costs incurred by ceding companies in connection with a e claims that are passed on to folksamerica under the reinsurance contracts 
management believes that fund american re does not have exposure to a e claims

pension and post retirement medical plans white mountains accounts for its pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and accounts for its retiree medical plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
sfas and sfas require that the cost of pension retiree medical benefits be accrued over the period during which an employee provides service 
the majority of onebeacon s pension and retiree medical plans were curtailed in the fourth quarter of the onebeacon pension plan no longer adds new participants or increases benefits for existing participants 
non vested participants already in the plan continue to vest during their employment with onebeacon 
retirees are also eligible for medical benefits if they meet certain age and service requirements 
however  due to the curtailment  the plan will no longer accepts new participants 
the majority of retiree medical costs are capped at defined dollar amounts  with retirees contributing the remainder 
the projected benefit obligation as of a particular date represents the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the plan s benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date 
therefore  future cash payments from pension and retiree medical plans are discounted using a discount rate based on published investment grade  long term corporate bond yields 
many of the factors which are used to determine a plan s projected benefit obligation as of a particular date and the cost of pension retiree medical benefits for a particular period are dependent upon future events  such as how long the employee and any survivors live  how many years of service the employee is expected to render and the employee s compensation in the years immediately before retirement or termination 
accordingly  the effects of such future factors are estimated 
further  since the projected benefit obligation and the periodic cost of pension retiree medical benefits are based on actuarial present values  they are also sensitive to changes in the discount rate used to determine such amounts 
a hypothetical increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease in pension and retiree medical projected benefit obligations of approximately million and million  respectively  and would result in a decrease in onebeacon s total pretax pension post retirement expense of approximately million 
a hypothetical decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in pension and retiree medical projected benefit obligations of approximately million and million  respectively  and would result in an increase in onebeacon s total pretax pension post retirement expense of approximately million 
additionally  the rate of return that is assumed on plan assets affects onebeacon s pension expense during a particular period 
since the retiree medical plan is unfunded  it is not affected by changes in the rate of return assumption 
onebeacon performed an analysis of expected long term rates of return based on the allocation of its pension plan assets as of both december  and december  to develop expected rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
a range of returns was developed based both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
although the expected investment return assumption is long term in nature  the range of reasonable returns has dropped over the past few years as a consequence of lower inflation and lower bond yields 
as a result of the most recent review  for onebeacon elected to keep the expected return on its pension assets at  as was used in at december   of plan assets were invested in fixed maturity securities  in equities and the remainder in cash  cash equivalents and convertible securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would result in a pretax change in onebeacon s pension expense or income as the case may be for of approximately million 
the health care cost trend rate was adjusted at december  to from to reflect current market conditions 
the rate will decrease each year over ten years to an ultimate rate of 
assumed health care cost trend rates typically have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
however  a hypothetical one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates has a minimal impact on the projected benefit obligation and no impact on the expense 
this is due to the significant changes in plan design related to cost sharing arrangements between onebeacon and the retirees 
since more cost has shifted to the retirees  the health care cost trend rate has less of an impact on white mountains financial statements 
during  onebeacon recognized pension income of million related to settlements and recognized pension expense of million comprising of net periodic benefit cost of million  special termination benefits of million  and consulting fees of million 
included in the net periodic benefit cost is million of expected return on pension plan assets 
onebeacon contributed million to the pension plan in no unrecognized losses on pension assets were recorded since the company uses the market value method to value plan assets 
purchase accounting and related deferred credits and goodwill as of december   white mountains had unamortized deferred credits and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
deferred credits represent the excess of the fair value of the net assets over the purchase price paid 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of companies acquired 
these deferred credits and goodwill resulted from white mountains pre july  acquisition activities which were accounted for in accordance with the treatment of a purchase business combination under accounting principles board apb no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk white mountains consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and other relevant market rates and prices 
due to white mountains sizable balances of interest rate sensitive instruments  market risk can have a significant effect on white mountains consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk fixed maturity portfolio 
in connection with the company s consolidated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  white mountains invests in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily debt securities 
white mountains strategy is to purchase fixed maturity investments that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risks 
white mountains fixed maturity investments are held as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  whereby these investments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with net unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in a separate component of common shareholders equity 
white mountains generally manages its interest rate risk associated with its portfolio of fixed maturity investments by monitoring the average duration of the portfolio  which allows white mountains to achieve an adequate yield without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk 
white mountains fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of primarily investment grade corporate securities  us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and mortgage backed securities eg  those receiving a rating from the national association of insurance commissioners of or 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments  respectively 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in market interest rates on white mountains fixed maturity portfolio and the interest rate swaps

as of december   white mountains indebtedness consisted primarily of the senior notes which have a fixed interest rate 
as a result  white mountains exposure to interest rate risk resulting from variable interest rate obligations is insignificant 
the senior notes were issued in and white mountains currently has no intention of redeeming this obligation prior to its maturity of may  at december   the fair value of white mountains senior notes was million  which compared to a carrying value of million 
the fair value of the senior notes was estimated by discounting future cash flows using incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements or quoted market prices 
equity price risk the carrying values of white mountains common equity securities and its other investments are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value which is based  in part  on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices of common equity securities  in general  are subject to fluctuations which could cause the amount to be realized upon sale or exercise of the instruments to differ significantly from the current reported value 
the fluctuations may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments  general market conditions and supply and demand imbalances for a particular security 
foreign currency exchange rates some of white mountains assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
white mountains foreign assets and liabilities are valued using year end exchange rates and its foreign revenues and expenses are valued using average exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that white mountains will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk arises specifically from white mountains foreign investment securities  the net assets and operations of fund american re  wmu  certain of folksamerica s and british insurance company s operations 
white mountains believes that the impact of any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have an insignificant effect on its financial statements as white mountains current net assets and operations denominated in foreign currencies are not material
