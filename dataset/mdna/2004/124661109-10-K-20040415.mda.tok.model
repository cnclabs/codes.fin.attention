item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands  except per share amounts and per pound lead amounts 
impact of economy and shift in customer demand during fiscal  primarily due to continuing weak economic conditions  particularly in the telecommunications market  there was a softening in demand for our products  with the exception of products sold to the ups market 
raw material pricing and productivity lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of our industrial batteries and electronics products and  accordingly  represent a significant portion of our materials costs 
during fiscal  and  the average london metals exchange lme price per pound of lead was as follows fiscal year average annual lme price per pound of lead lowest average monthly lme price per pound of lead highest average monthly lme price per pound of lead we have a long term cost containment program to minimize manufacturing costs 
under the program  we continue to allocate a significant amount of our normal annual capital expenditures to cost containment and productivity improvement projects 
inflation the cost to c d of manufacturing materials and labor and most other operating costs are affected by inflationary pressures 
our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases to our customers through higher prices may be limited during periods of stable or declining lead prices because of industry pricing practices that tend to link product prices and lead prices 
during the recent increase of lead prices in the second half of fiscal  we have not been able to fully offset the higher lead prices through selective price increases 
we believe that  over recent years  we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases on items other than lead by o effective raw materials purchasing programs  o increases in labor productivity  o improvements in overall manufacturing efficiencies  and o selective price increases of our products 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items in c d s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes net income before minority interest minority interest net income critical accounting policies we have identified the critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the policies set forth below require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
litigation and environmental reserves c d is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
we also expend funds for environmental remediation of both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  specifically sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  we record a loss and establish a reserve for litigation or remediation when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability exists and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications  demands or settlements that have been received from a regulatory authority or private party  estimates performed by independent engineering companies and outside counsel  available facts  existing and proposed technology  the identification of other prps  their ability to contribute and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
however  the reserves may materially differ from ultimate actual liabilities if the loss contingency is difficult to estimate or if management s judgments turn out to be inaccurate 
if management believes no best estimate exists  the minimum loss is accrued 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analyses 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected long term rates of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be required 
inventory reserves c d adjusts the value of its obsolete and unmarketable inventory to the estimated market value based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts c d maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty reserves c d provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers products and processes  c d s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  warranty replacement costs and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  warranty replacement costs or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be made 
deferred tax valuation allowance c d records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event c d were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should c d determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
revenue recognition c d recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of the agreement  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
accruals are made for sales returns and other allowances based on our experience 
while returns have historically been minimal and within the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill and other indefinite lived assets are not amortized and are subject to the impairment rules of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which c d adopted on february  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of certain circumstances or events 
c d determines the fair market value of its reporting units using quoted market rates and cash flow techniques 
the fair market value of the reporting units is compared to the carrying value of the reporting units to determine if an impairment loss should be calculated 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is indicated 
the loss is calculated by comparing the fair value of the goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
if the book value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded 
fair value of goodwill is determined by subtracting the fair value of the identifiable assets of a reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
in the fiscal year ended january   we recorded an impairment of goodwill in our motive power division  resulting in the complete write off of all goodwill related to the motive power division 
no impairment to goodwill existed in any of our other divisions as of january  no impairment to goodwill in any division existed as of january  research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs consist of direct and indirect internal costs related to specific projects 
the cost of materials whether from our normal inventory or acquired specially for research and development activities and equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise are capitalized as tangible assets when acquired or constructed 
the cost of such materials consumed in research and development activities and the depreciation of such equipment or facilities used in those activities are recorded as research and development costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal all comparisons are with the corresponding periods in the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
net sales for fiscal decreased  or to  from  in fiscal this decrease resulted from lower customer demand for products of the powercom  power electronics and motive power divisions  partially offset by higher customer demand for products of the dynasty division 
sales by the powercom division declined  or  primarily due to lower sales to the telecommunications market 
the powercom division derives approximately of its sales from telecommunications infrastructure spending  and we continue to be adversely affected by the decreased spending in this industry 
however  we understand from our major customers that they plan to increase capital spending 
sales of the power electronics division fell  or  mainly due to lower dc to dc converter sales 
power electronics had a solid fourth quarter  with revenue increasing across the division 
end markets  including networking and office automation  appear to be strengthening 
this division introduced over new products in fiscal year  accounting for approximately of the division s revenue 
motive power divisional sales dropped  or due to lower sales of batteries and chargers 
dynasty division sales increased  or  primarily due to an increase in demand in the ups market 
the dynasty division generates approximately of its sales from this market 
gross profit for fiscal decreased  or to  from  in the prior year 
gross margin increased slightly from in fiscal year to in fiscal year gross profit declined in the powercom division  primarily as a result of lower sales volumes  startup costs of approximately  at our new reynosa  mexico facility and higher lead costs  partially offset by a favorable year end lifo inventory adjustment of  gross profit in the motive power division increased on lower sales  primarily due to the improvement in plant operational effectiveness in fiscal  partially offset by higher lead costs 
gross profit in the power electronics division increased on lower sales primarily due to the re organization charges of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the closure of our shannon  ireland facility and the benefits of relocating certain mexican manufacturing activities to our guangzhou  china facility  which has lower manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or 
this increase was primarily due to  of higher warranty costs  higher payroll related costs of  and the prior year gain of  recognized on the sale of our conshohocken  pennsylvania facility  partially offset by lower variable selling costs of associated with the decreased sales volumes 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased or less than 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal operating income decreased  or to  from  in the prior year 
this decrease was the result of lower operating income generated by the powercom division  partially offset by a lower operating loss in the motive power division  operating income in the power electronics division in fiscal compared to an operating loss in fiscal and higher operating income in the dynasty division 
interest expense  net  decreased  in fiscal compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower average debt balances outstanding during the year  coupled with a lower effective interest rate 
income tax expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal  primarily as the result of lower income before income taxes  partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate consists of statutory rates adjusted for the tax impacts of foreign operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from in the prior year  primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of state tax audits in the fourth quarter of fiscal minority interest of in fiscal reflects the ownership interest in the joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china that is not owned by c d 
the decrease in minority interest was due to lower profitability of the shanghai joint venture 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  net income decreased  or to  or per share basic and per share diluted 
future outlook the escalating price of lead negatively affects our business 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the negative effect of higher lead prices over the prior year s fourth quarter was approximately cents per share 
we anticipate that high lead pricing will continue to adversely affect our profitability in the near term 
we have launched pricing initiatives to at least partially offset rising lead prices 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect revenues to increase modestly and to generate diluted earnings per share of between to per share 
in addition  as we continue to assimilate the reynosa facility  we expect to record integration charges  including expenses of approximately  to  for rigging and transporting equipment as well as severance 
there may also be asset impairment charges related to our huguenot  new york and or leola  pennsylvania facilities in fiscal  although we cannot with certainty predict the magnitude or timing of such outcomes 
the chinese government has notified our joint venture battery business that it will be required to relocate the shanghai plant 
negotiations are in process between the joint venture and the chinese government regarding the details surrounding the specific location  timing and cost responsibilities related to the relocation of the shanghai plant 
our joint venture has tentatively agreed to an arrangement with the chinese government whereby we will relocate our shanghai facility to a site elsewhere in the pudong development zone 
the tentative agreement calls for a payout of approximately  to c d  which will be supplemented by approximately  from the joint venture to build a new facility 
we anticipate that the new factory will be complete by the end of fiscal year fiscal compared to fiscal all comparisons are with the corresponding periods in the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
net sales for fiscal decreased  or to  from  in fiscal this decrease resulted from lower customer demand for products of all divisions 
sales by the powercom division declined  or  primarily due to lower sales to the telecommunications and ups markets 
this business continued to be affected by the lower spending levels in the telecommunications sector 
however  the division had more than  in sales from products introduced during fiscal dynasty division sales decreased  or  also due to a decline in sales to the telecommunications and ups markets  partially offset by an increase in sales to the mobility market 
the lower market demand for sealed product continued to affect this division 
new products contributed approximated  of sales to this division 
sales of the power electronics division fell  or  mainly due to lower dc to dc converter sales  standard power supply sales and custom power supply sales 
the division was negatively impacted by a substantial reduction in the requirements of a single customer 
although the overall pace of the power electronics division remained sluggish due to the continuing state of the telecommunications market  we were encouraged by the number of new products we brought to market 
over of fiscal sales by the power electronics division came from products introduced since fiscal additionally  we overhauled the distribution channels of this division 
distributors were replaced and upgraded during fiscal  while the manufacturing representative network was strengthened 
our web based initiatives came on line in the latter part of fiscal and we began to see positive results 
motive power divisional sales dropped  or due to lower sales of batteries and chargers 
motive power sales increased modestly in the fourth quarter of fiscal  based upon recent changes in sales channels 
additionally  we launched a private branding program for batteries and chargers to customers with whom we had not previously done business 
gross profit for fiscal decreased  or to  from  in the prior year  resulting in a decrease in gross margin from to 
gross profit declined in the powercom  dynasty and motive power divisions  primarily as a result of lower sales volumes  coupled with plant operational difficulties in the motive power division 
gross profit in the power electronics division increased on lower sales due to inventory related charges in the prior fiscal year  partially offset by re organization charges of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the closure of our shannon  ireland facility and the relocation of certain mexican manufacturing activities to our guangzhou  china facility  which has lower manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased  or 
this decrease was primarily due to i lower variable selling costs of  associated with the decreased sales volumes  ii the implementation of sfas no 
in fiscal  which discontinued the amortization of goodwill of  iii costs recorded in fiscal of  related to a potential acquisition that did not close  iv lower payroll related expenses of  v the gain of  recognized on the sale of our conshohocken  pennsylvania facility  and vi lower advertising expenses of partially offsetting this decrease were i higher warranty expenses of  and ii the positive effect of the full recovery of certain litigation and settlement costs of  from one of our insurance carriers during the first quarter of fiscal research and development expenses decreased or  primarily due to lower spending in the power electronics and powercom divisions 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal as a result of lower sales volumes 
operating income decreased  or to  from  in the prior year 
this decrease was the result of lower operating income generated by the powercom and dynasty divisions  coupled with a higher operating loss generated by the motive power division 
this decrease was partially offset by a lower operating loss in the power electronics division 
interest expense  net  decreased  in fiscal compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower average debt balances outstanding during the year  coupled with lower effective interest rates 
income tax expense for fiscal decreased  from fiscal  primarily as the result of lower income before income taxes and a decrease in our effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate consists of statutory rates adjusted for the tax impacts of research and development credits and foreign operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in the prior year  primarily as a result of the resolution of state tax audits in the fourth quarter of fiscal minority interest of in fiscal reflects the ownership interest in the joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china that is not owned by c d 
the decrease in minority interest was due to lower profitability of the shanghai joint venture 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  net income decreased  or to  or per share basic and per share diluted 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended january  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to i a smaller decrease in inventory in fiscal versus fiscal  ii a smaller increase in net deferred tax liabilities  iii a decrease in net income  and iv a smaller increase in accounts payable in fiscal versus fiscal these changes  resulting in lower net cash provided by operating activities  were partially offset by a smaller increase in other long term assets in fiscal versus fiscal  primarily due to significantly lower pension contributions in fiscal and an increase in other current liabilities in the current year primarily due to warranty accruals versus a decrease in the prior year 
net cash used by investing activities increased  or to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  due to the acquisition of the reynosa business  coupled with lower proceeds from the disposal of property  plant and equipment 
fiscal proceeds included  from the sale of our conshohocken  pennsylvania facility 
the property was sold for  including a  note receivable 
acquisition of property  plant and equipment excluding the purchase of the reynosa business decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal net cash used by financing activities decreased  or to  in fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to a lower repayment of long term debt  coupled with lower purchases of treasury stock 
on november   we refinanced our existing five year credit facility  which was due to expire on march  the refinancing was arranged by bank of america and includes nine other lenders 
the new agreement is a  revolving credit facility  which has a termination date of november  the interest rates are determined by our leverage ratio and are available at libor plus to libor plus or prime to prime plus 
based on our current leverage  the loans under the revolving credit facility are priced at libor plus 
the agreement requires c d to pay a fee of 
to 
per annum  depending on our leverage ratio  on any unused portion of the revolver 
the revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit facility not to exceed  and swingline loans not to exceed  the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that require c d to maintain minimum ratios such as fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios as well as minimum consolidated net worth 
we were in compliance with our loan agreement covenants at january  the availability under this agreement is expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing cash needs for working capital requirements  debt service  capital expenditures and possible strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures during fiscal were incurred to fund cost reduction programs  normal maintenance and regulatory compliance 
fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of  to  primarily to fund investment in our reynosa  mexico and shanghai  china facilities  as well as cost reduction programs  normal maintenance and regulatory compliance 
we intend to continue making prudent purchases of our stock  paying down debt and selectively pursuing complementary acquisitions 
strategic acquisition opportunities will be expected to enhance c d s long term competitive position and growth prospects and may require external financing 
we cannot assure  however  that we will close on any such acquisitions 
our bank loan agreement permits dividends to be paid on our common stock as long as there is no default under that agreement 
subject to that restriction and the provisions of delaware law  our board of directors currently intends to continue paying dividends 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so since future dividends will depend on our earnings  financial condition and other factors

 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except as stated below  and for hedging relationships designated after june  in addition  except as stated below  all provisions of sfas no 
should be applied prospectively 
the provisions of sfas no 
relate to sfas no 
implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal year quarters that began prior to june  and should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates 
in addition  paragraphs a and a  which relate to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist  should be applied to both existing contracts and new contracts entered into after june  sfas no 
had no significant impact at the point of adoption on our consolidated statements of income or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revisions to sfas no 
are intended to improve financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans and were initiated in in response to concerns raised by investors and other users of financial statements about the need for greater transparency of pension information 
in particular  the standard requires that companies provide more detail about their plan assets  benefit obligations  cash flows  benefit costs and other relevant quantitative and qualitative information 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after december  c d has complied with these revised disclosure requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
market risk factors we are exposed to various market risks 
the primary financial risks include fluctuations in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates 
we manage these risks by using derivative instruments 
we do not invest in derivative securities for speculative purposes  but do enter into hedging arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as well as to fluctuations in exchange rates 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments and interest rate swap contracts 
the net market value of our debt instruments was  and  at january  and  respectively 
the debt instruments are subject to variable rate interest  and therefore the market value is not sensitive to interest rate movements 
interest rate swap contracts are used to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our underlying variable rate debt instruments 
we employ separate swap transactions rather than fixed rate obligations to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs associated with floating rate debt while also eliminating possible risk related to refinancing in the fixed rate market 
the net market value of our interest rate swaps was  and  at january  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in rates at january  and would result in a and a increase in the market value  respectively 
a basis point decrease in rates at january  and would result in a and a decrease in the market value  respectively 
the above sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
we calculate the market value of the interest rate swaps by utilizing a standard net present value model based on the market conditions as of the valuation date 
we use currency forwards and swaps to hedge anticipated cash flows in foreign currencies 
the exposures currently hedged are the british pound  the euro  the mexican peso and canadian dollar 
these financial instruments represent a net market value of and at january  and  respectively 
to monitor our currency exchange rate risk  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on earnings in the case of a change in exchange rates 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables being held constant 
at january  and  a strengthening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in an increase of the net market value of the forwards of  and  respectively 
at january  and  a weakening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in a decrease in the net market value of the forwards of  and  respectively 
the market value of the instruments was determined by taking into consideration the contracted interest rates and foreign exchange rates versus those available for similar maturities in the market at january  and  respectively 
foreign exchange forwards are used to hedge our firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
there is either a balance sheet or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis
