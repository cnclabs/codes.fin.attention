table of contents in september  we introduced our auditscan network vulnerability assessment service  as an option to watchguard customers available beginning in the fourth quarter of through the livesecurity service subscription 
auditscan service has been developed in partnership with qualys  inc  a leading web service provider of network security audits and vulnerability management  and is designed to enable organizations to perform independent network security audits quickly  easily and cost effectively 
in february  we introduced our firebox x line of integrated  expandable security appliances for smes  combining firewall  vpn  application layer security  intrusion prevention functionality  spam blocking  web filtering and authentication in a single appliance designed to enable customers to upgrade the appliance to any higher model in the same line or to add ports just by applying a software license key 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to revenue recognition  including sales returns and allowances  the provision for bad debt  inventory reserves  restructuring reserves  the allocation of purchase price in business combinations to intangible assets  and analysis for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
although we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
the complexity of the revenue recognition rules and estimates inherent in the revenue recognition process makes revenue results difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues or delay in recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we generate revenues through sales of products and service subscriptions indirectly through our distribution network at a discount from list price  sales of products and service subscriptions to our service provider customers at volume pricing rates  and sales of service subscription renewals directly to end users 

table of contents product revenues  net of sales returns  allowances and promotions  include sales of our security appliances and the perpetual software license fees for our firebox products that are bundled with the sale of our security appliances as part of our security solutions  revenues from license sales of software options  such as user expansion and software management modules  revenues from sales of our network operations center security suite software license as part of our managed security solution  hardware sales of our rapidstream secured by check point line of high performance security appliances  and sales of our serverlock products and anti virus solutions for server content  application and desktop security 
revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for undelivered elements of the arrangement has been established 
while we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment  revenues on product sales for some of our major distributors are recorded when these distributors have sold the product to their customers 
service revenues primarily include the initial fees for our livesecurity service subscriptions  which have periods ranging from days to one year and are sold as part of our security solutions  and for livesecurity service subscription renewals  which have periods ranging from nine months to two years  from our enterprise customers and end users 
these service fees provide our customers access to our livesecurity service for product updates  security threat responses  general security information and technical support 
these service fees also enable our service provider customers access to the livesecurity service and the ability to manage and update a specific number of their customers security appliances 
service subscription revenues are recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the subscription period generally ranging from days to two years 
when service fees are bundled with the sales of our products in multiple element arrangements  the elements of those arrangements are unbundled using our objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements represented by our customary pricing for each element when sold in separate transactions 
since customers receive the services over a period of time  watchguard determines the fair value of the service portion of the arrangement as an undelivered element  based on the renewal price of the service 
changes in the composition of such multiple element arrangements  our ability to identify the existence of the vendor specific objective evidence for the elements in the arrangement or our ability to estimate the fair value of elements in the arrangement could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
we have established allowances for estimated returns and pricing protection rights 
we have also established an allowance for promotional rebates that may be earned by our customers 
we estimate these allowances and adjust them periodically based on historical rates of returns and allowances  as well as the expected effect of current promotional programs and new product introductions 
we estimate the allowance for promotional rebates based on the maximum amounts potentially available to the customers  unless we have accumulated sufficient historic evidence for individual customers with respect to their realization of rebates 
if new or expanded promotional programs are introduced  or new products are announced  additional allowances will be required 
alternatively  if actual promotional rebates fall below maximum exposure levels  we will reduce the allowances and recognize additional revenue 
bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
significant judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization 
table of contents of receivables  including the probability of collection and the creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we write our inventories down to estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the introduction of new products that replace existing products  technological advances  and variation in market trends or customer preferences could  however  significantly affect these estimates and result in additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
restructuring in  and  we recorded significant accruals related to our restructuring plans 
these accruals included estimates related to the abandonment of excess facilities 
we have adjusted  as required  the restructuring accruals due to continued poor real estate market conditions in the areas where these excess facilities are located 
the actual costs related to the restructuring may differ from our estimate if it takes us longer than expected to find suitable tenants for excess facilities or if there are further changes in the real estate market in those areas where excess facilities are located 
any additional adjustments resulting from these factors could have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
business combinations purchase price allocation we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting prescribed by statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  we allocate the total consideration paid in an acquisition to the fair value of the acquired company s identifiable assets and liabilities 
the remainder of consideration is allocated to goodwill 
we identify and record separately the intangible assets acquired apart from goodwill based on the specific criteria for separate recognition established in sfas  namely the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights or the asset is capable of being separated from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
we recognize current technology as a separate intangible asset acquired and assign the value to this technology based on the income valuation approach  reflecting the present value of the projected net cash flows expected to be generated from future commercial sales of products incorporating this current technology 
watchguard capitalizes the acquired technology that has reached the phase of technological feasibility 
apart from the capitalized current technology  we also identify the value of the research and development efforts spent on the technology that has not yet reached the technological feasibility stage and does not have alternative future uses 
we base this value of the in process research and development on several factors  including the state of the development of each project  the time and cost needed to complete the project  expected income and associated risks related to the viability of the potential changes in future target markets 
the value of the in process research and development is expensed at the time of acquisition pursuant to the provisions of sfas accounting for goodwill and other intangible long lived assets our business acquisitions have resulted in  and future acquisitions typically will result in  the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including capitalized technology and other definite lived intangible assets 

table of contents pursuant to sfas  we test purchased goodwill for impairment at least annually 
application of the goodwill impairment test may require judgments  including those inherent in the determination of fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides and the resulting determination of the implicit value of the goodwill 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value 
separable intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives ranging between three and five years 
in accordance with sfas  these assets are also periodically reviewed for the existence of facts and circumstances  both internal and external  which may suggest potential impairment 
the determination of whether these intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgments based on short and long term projections of future performance 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to continue to develop and ultimately to commercialize the products based on these intangible assets  as well as our projections of future cash flows from these products 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in an impairment charge to our operating expenses  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

table of contents years ended december  and revenues year ended december  percent increase decrease revenues in thousands product service total revenues as of total revenues product service total we categorize our revenues into three geographic regions the americas  europe middle east africa  or emea  and asia pacific  or apac

table of contents revenue information for customers representing more than of total revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  percent increase revenues tech data ingram micro revenues tech data ingram micro the dollar and percentage decrease in product revenues for as compared to was primarily due to decreased revenues from sales of our firebox iii product line 
firebox iii revenues decreased despite an increase in unit shipments due to a reduction in average selling prices 
the unfavorable pricing changes are the result of sales promotions and extension of aggressive trade up and competitive trade in programs we introduced in response to competitive pricing pressure in the mid tier of our market  combined with product life cycle considerations 
the decline in revenues is also partially attributable to a mix shift as we introduced a lower priced product model within the firebox iii line in the first quarter of we have managed inventory levels of the firebox iii line in anticipation of the introduction of our firebox x product line in february  which is aimed at smes and is therefore competitive with our existing firebox iii product line 
the decrease in product revenues is also partially attributable to the decline in sales of the rapidstream secured by checkpoint products  due to our increased focus on the sme market and diminished sales and marketing support for the rapid stream secured by checkpoint brand  which is aimed at the large enterprise market 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to exit the market segment served by those products and terminated their manufacturing and promotion 
partially offsetting these declines were revenue increases from our soho and vclass product lines 
those increases are attributable to growth in unit shipments from new product introductions  including the firebox vclass in the second quarter of  the firebox soho in the third quarter of  further additions of new products to the firebox vclass in the first quarter of and firebox soho wireless products in the second quarter of from a regional standpoint  we experienced a decrease in total revenues from our apac market  specifically in japan  while total revenues for the americas and emea increased 
in the beginning of and continuing throughout  we realigned our apac business  focused on improving the performance of our sales channel  reevaluated our channel customer selection strategy and localized some of our products 
given these realignment efforts in the apac region and the continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and constrained corporate information technology spending  it is difficult to predict future revenue levels  which may decrease or fluctuate more than they have historically 
it is still too early to determine if recent signs of slight improvement in information technology spending by businesses and positive sentiment on the economic outlook in late will continue and can translate into increased demand for our products 
we may be unable to maintain or increase the demand for our products  our revenues may not grow at all or may decline  and we may be unable to achieve similar results in future periods 
service revenues consist of revenues recognized from initial fees for our livesecurity service subscriptions bundled with a hardware product sale  and revenues recognized for subscription renewals sold to the existing customer base 
the increase in service revenues in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for as compared to  was primarily due to the increase in revenues generated on subscription renewals  as our installed customer base grows 

table of contents this increase in revenues from subscription renewals was partially offset by several factors as follows changes in terms of our initial livesecurity service subscriptions  bundled with a product sale  due to our including a shorter initial subscription period for certain products beginning in mid  a reduction of livesecurity service subscription prices corresponding to lower prices on related hardware products in response to a competitive environment  and a shift in product mix toward lower priced models of the firebox iii product line  resulting in the corresponding shift in mix in livesecurity service subscription revenues 
the increase in service revenues for as compared to is also partially attributable to service revenue of  in generated from livesecurity services that were provided through certain managed security customers to their end users in prior periods  but were identified by watchguard through a license compliance initiative as being previously unreported to watchguard by those customers 
service revenues recognized from initial service subscription fees are generally related to product shipments in preceding quarters  while revenues recognized from service renewals depend on the existing customer base 
a decline in product shipments will result in lower initial livesecurity service subscriptions bundled with the products  while an increase in our installed customer base will increase the number of customers with the opportunity to renew their livesecurity service subscriptions 
as a result  it is difficult to predict future service revenue levels 
the provision for sales returns  price protection rights and promotional rebates was million  or of total revenues before these returns and allowances  in and million  or of total revenues before returns and allowances  in the higher provision in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for as compared to corresponds to increased unit shipments  as well as an increase in promotional offerings in we expect to introduce new products and promotional programs each year  which may affect our reserve for sales returns and allowances

cost of product revenues includes the cost of manufacturing our security appliances  distribution operations  product packaging  third party product licensing fees and provisions for inventory reserves and warranty 
the dollar increase in cost of product revenues for as compared to was primarily due to the increase in unit volume and in the provision for inventory reserves 
the provision for inventory reserves increased from million in to million in quantities of shipments of our products and related consumption of component inventory have been below our expectations 
our sales projections for future quarters and product life cycle considerations related to our plan to introduce new products in the latter part of  resulted in our recording an additional provision for inventory reserves for certain of our products and related components 
the provision also includes the write down of our rapidstream secured by check point brand products  as we discontinued further development and marketing of this brand 
this brand is a subset of the products and technology obtained as a result of our april acquisition of rapidstream 
the decline in product margins as a percentage of product revenues was negatively affected by an increase in inventory reserves  by continued competitive pricing in the marketplace for our products  which included aggressive trade up and competitive trade in programs relating to the firebox iii line  by the introduction of new lower margin product models within the firebox iii and firebox vclass product lines in the beginning of  and by the relatively fixed nature of distribution and manufacturing support costs on lower revenues 

table of contents if the provision for inventory reserves were excluded from the calculation of product margin  the product margin as a percentage of product revenues would have been approximately for and for forecasting future product gross margin is difficult  as our gross margins may be adversely affected in the future by various factors  such as competitive selling pressures  the impact on the existing inventory values when replacement products are introduced and availability of key components 
our margins as a percentage of revenues could also be negatively affected by continued economic uncertainty  which could result in downward pressure on the prices of technology based products 
cost of service revenues includes the costs of our technical support organization and costs associated with our livesecurity service 
cost of service revenues increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of related revenues for as compared to the dollar increase in cost of services is primarily related to the increase of internal information technology costs associated with the livesecurity service and customer support 
in  we made significant investments in information technology that consolidated our customer facing applications and databases and migrated them onto more scalable and extensible application platforms 
this cost increase was partially offset by cost savings achieved after transitioning to a new provider of the first level of customer support 
service margins increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of service revenues due to operational and cost efficiencies we have realized from our expanded customer base  resulting in lower incremental costs incurred to add each additional subscription customer 
we expect service costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as our user base expands 
actual service costs and margins could differ materially from those anticipated  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
operating expenses sales and marketing year ended december  percent decrease sales and marketing expenses in thousands sales and marketing expenses as of total revenues sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and employee related expenses and certain variable marketing expenses  including distributor promotional costs  public relations costs  marketing collateral  trade show and advertising expenses 
the dollar decrease in sales and marketing expenses for as compared to was primarily due to the decline in variable marketing expenditures  especially due to a reduction of distributor promotional programs 
distributor promotional programs were reduced from million in to million in those costs declined as we attempted to balance those activities with the increases in direct sales discounts available to our channel customers 
costs of other marketing programs  such as advertising  marketing collateral and promotions  trade shows  public relations  market research  direct marketing and other programs declined from million in to million in the reduction in those marketing programs resulted from our enhanced expenditures in related to the international rollout of the new firebox vclass product line 

table of contents those decreases in distributor promotional costs and marketing programs were partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits 
in  we expect our sales and marketing expenses  in absolute dollar terms  to remain comparable to the levels incurred in should our revenues improve  we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues as we focus on improving depth and productivity of our distribution network and cost effectiveness of our marketing efforts 
our actual sales and marketing expenses could differ materially from those anticipated  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
research and development year ended december  percent decrease research and development expenses in thousands research and development expenses as of total revenues research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products  product integration efforts and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  costs of noncapitalized equipment  software tools  our security appliance prototypes and certification procedures  payments to designers and contractors and depreciation of capital equipment and software 
research and development expenses decreased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for as compared to this decline is primarily related to the decline in salaries and benefits associated with elimination in personnel redundancies caused by our rapidstream acquisition in headcount related compensation costs and other research and development costs increased substantially in the second quarter of as a result of the rapidstream acquisition and due to product integration efforts we implemented to accelerate the rollout of new vclass products based on the rapidstream technology 
headcount was gradually brought down to pre acquisition levels by the end of the second quarter of as redundant functions were eliminated 
also  lower than expected serverlock revenue in resulted in reductions of related research and development costs for this product line 
these cost savings were partially offset by the increase in outsourced expenses  due primarily to the additional cost of undergoing the evaluation for common criteria evaluation assurance level and federal processing standards certification for the firebox vclass product line in we intend to continue to fund our research and development efforts in order to meet the changing requirements of our customers  to provide for continued introduction of new products as technology advances and to enhance and expand our current product offerings 
we expect to continue investments in key areas aimed at the development of new generations of our products  further extension of our existing product lines and the development of future technologies 
at the same time  we expect the overall cost of research and development for to be comparable to as we continue to concentrate on cost control and efficiency initiatives in our research and development activities 
should our revenues improve  we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
our actual research and development expenses could differ materially from those anticipated  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents general and administrative year ended december  percent increase general and administrative expenses in thousands general and administrative expenses as of total revenues general and administrative expenses include costs of executive  human resource  finance and administrative support functions  provisions for uncollectible accounts  costs of legal and accounting professional services  and director and officer insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars and declined slightly as a percentage of revenues for as compared to the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses for as compared to reflects increases in severance costs  as well as an increase in legal and accounting fees as a result of enhanced corporate governance requirements 
those increases were partially offset by a reduction in travel costs 
general and administrative expenses declined slightly as a percentage of revenues  primarily due to improved revenues in for  we anticipate a modest increase in general and administrative expenses  in terms of absolute dollars  from the levels incurred in as we may incur additional expenses in connection with enhanced regulatory and corporate governance requirements relating to additional internal controls and procedures pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of our actual general and administrative expenses could differ materially from those anticipated  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses allocated by functional operating expense category were as follows in thousands year ended december  percent decrease sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total amortization of stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses arise primarily from amortization of previously deferred stock based compensation over the vesting periods of common stock subject to repurchase and stock options 
deferred stock based compensation is initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity in the amount of the excess of the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant over the exercise price of options and also in the amount of the fair value of our common stock that we issued in connection with our october acquisition of qiave and our april acquisition of rapidstream that is subject to repurchase 
in addition  deferred stock based compensation is recorded for the fair value of stock options granted to consultants 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized into expense over the relevant vesting periods using the accelerated method 
amortization of other intangible assets acquired amortization of other intangible assets acquired consists of amortization of capitalized technology and other definite lived intangibles related to our acquisitions of qiave in and rapidstream in we are amortizing the intangible assets on a straight line basis over useful lives ranging from three to five years 

table of contents amortization of other intangible assets acquired was million for and million for the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets acquired for as compared to resulted primarily from the reduction in the amortizable basis of other intangible assets 
this reduction  in turn  was caused by the impairment of the technology we obtained in the acquisition of qiave in october  as discussed below 
the amortization related to this technology decreased by approximately million in as compared to this intangible asset was fully amortized by the end of this reduction in amortization was partially offset by the  increase in amortization of technology obtained in the acquisition of rapidstream in april this increase is primarily caused by the fact that in this technology was amortized for a full year  as opposed to  when it was amortized over only a partial year from the time of acquisition 
impairment of other intangible assets acquired in addition to the amortization expense  a partial impairment of the intangible assets related to our acquisition of qiave in was recorded in the fourth quarter of and a partial impairment of the intangible assets related to our acquisition of rapidstream in was recorded in the third and fourth quarters of in accordance with sfas  the carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  that may suggest impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we developed a business plan that  because of limited resources  constrained further development and integration of the technology we obtained in connection with our acquisition of qiave in october separately  we continued to realize lower than expected revenue from products based on the qiave technology 
as a result  the expected future cash flows were determined to be insufficient to support the carrying value of the qiave capitalized technology 
we therefore recorded an impairment charge of million in the last quarter of of capitalized technology related to the acquisition of qiave 
during the third quarter of  it was determined that an impairment existed for the intangible asset associated with the rapidstream secured by check point product brand based on the technology obtained in the acquisition of rapidstream 
our increased focus on the sme market  resulting in a significant reduction in our sales  marketing and development efforts in support of this brand  together with the historically poor performance of this brand  led management to reduce the future sales projections for the brand 
the revised undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from the reduced sales projections were determined to be insufficient to recover the carrying value of the related capitalized technology 
we therefore recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of based on the revised estimate of the asset s fair value using a discounted cash flow approach 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit the market segment served by this product  we therefore recorded an additional impairment charge of  for the remaining book value of this intangible asset 
acquired in process technology acquired in process technology expenses of million in consists of in process research and development expense related to our acquisition of rapidstream 
restructuring charges the restructuring charges in are associated with the restructuring plans initiated in and 
table of contents in the second quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan designed to streamline operations and reduce operating costs  which included a reduction in workforce and a consolidation of excess facilities  in addition to other cost saving strategies 
as part of the restructuring plan  we exited the consumer security market and terminated various original equipment manufacturer agreements to develop products and services for that market  and streamlined operations in support of new products and services aimed at business customers 
in  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million  relating to revised estimates of the costs associated with the consolidation and sublease of excess facilities 
in the second quarter of  we implemented a second restructuring plan primarily designed to eliminate redundancies and excess headcount resulting from the acquisition of rapidstream  which included a reduction in workforce  consolidation of excess facilities and elimination of technology related contracts that are no longer required or part of our strategy 
as a result of this restructuring  we recorded a million restructuring charge in  relating to severance and termination benefits  costs of consolidation and sublease of excess facilities and cost of technology related contracts cancellation 
the restructuring charges of million in are associated with the restructuring plans initiated in and  discussed above 
the additional charges in relate to the revision of our estimates for future costs associated with the sublease of excess facilities in our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington 
as the real estate market in downtown seattle remains depressed  we revised down our earlier estimates of possible sublease rental income for our space that remains vacant 
interest income and interest expense interest income is generated primarily from our investment of proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in and our follow on public offering in february interest income decreased from million in to million in the decrease was caused by both a decrease in the average balance invested and a decline in the average rates of return 
net interest expense primarily represents financing costs incurred due to term discounts taken by our customers 
interest expense increased from  in to  in the increase in term discounts taken was caused by the increase in revenues generated from our larger channel customers to whom such discounts were available 
income taxes income tax expense of  in and  in primarily relates to our provision for foreign income taxes associated with our international operations 
we have experienced losses since inception  resulting in a net operating loss carryforward position for federal income tax purposes of approximately million as of december  these carryforwards  if not utilized  will begin to expire after the tax year  and may be subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in addition  approximately million of the net operating losses generated for federal income tax purposes are not available to reduce income tax expense for financial reporting purposes because the effects of tax deductions for employee stock options in excess of the related financial reporting compensation expense are recognized through equity 
a valuation allowance has been established to reflect the uncertainty of generating future taxable income necessary to utilize available tax loss carryforwards

we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is not material 
our working capital as of december  was million 
operating activities our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in and million in the operating cash outflows during these periods resulted primarily from net losses 

table of contents the difference between our net loss and our operating cash outflow is attributable to noncash expenses included in net loss  and changes in the operating assets and liabilities  as presented below in thousands year ended december  net loss add noncash expenses add changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities noncash expenses are associated with the amortization and impairment of other intangible assets acquired  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  and compensation charges resulting from the issuance of stock options and common stock subject to repurchase by watchguard

changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect primarily changes in working capital components of the balance sheet apart from cash and short term investments  and also changes in long term deferred revenues and long term acquisition and restructuring liabilities with larger fluctuations within some of them as described below 
trade accounts receivable  net decreased from million at december  to million at december   primarily reflecting lower total revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding  or dsos  calculated on a quarterly basis  decreased from days at december  to days at december  dsos are affected by the payment terms contained in our customer contracts which may vary geographically  term discounts taken by our customers  revenues on product sales for some of our major distributors that are recorded when these distributors have sold the product to their customers  risks associated with the uncertain economy  and whether revenues in a particular quarter are linear that is  whether revenues are evenly distributed throughout the quarter or weighted more toward the end of the quarter 
based on our current sales mix  the linearity of revenues in past and future quarters and timing differences arising from the varying payment terms in our customer agreements  we expect our dsos to generally range from to days in the future 
any change in these factors  however  could negatively affect expected dso results 
net inventories decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in inventories is primarily due to the reduction in volume of inventory on hand for older products in anticipation of the introduction of our new firebox x product line in february the decrease in inventory is also due to reducing the cost of certain components  including our rapidstream secured by check point brand products  to net realizable value based on our sales projections combined with our product life cycle planning process and expectations of new product releases in the latter part of total accrued restructuring and acquisition costs decreased from million at december  to million at december   due to settlements of an abandoned lease and a technology related contract  as well as to the ongoing payment of rents on excess facilities 
the reduction of accrued restructuring costs was partially offset by an additional million charge  due to increased estimates of future costs of abandoned facilities 

table of contents total deferred revenues decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease of deferred revenue balance is related to the following factors changes in terms of our initial livesecurity service subscriptions  bundled with a product sale  due to our including a shorter initial subscription period for certain products beginning in mid  a reduction of livesecurity service subscription prices corresponding to lower prices on related hardware products in response to a competitive environment  and a shift in product mix toward lower priced models of the firebox iii product line  resulting in the corresponding shift in mix in livesecurity service subscription revenues

financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in both periods reflects the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our existing available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we may seek additional funding before that time through public or private financings or other arrangements  however  if the underlying assumed levels of spending prove to be inaccurate  or if we choose to pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary business technology 
contractual obligations and contingencies we lease office space and some computer equipment under operating leases that are not cancelable 
our facilities commitments include a lease for our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington  which expires in september we have the option to extend this lease for an additional five year term 
we also lease a product fulfillment and distribution warehouse in seattle with a lease term through april we lease facilities in aliso viejo  san jose and tustin  california and waltham  massachusetts under operating leases that expire between and  in addition to leases for other sales offices under operating leases or other lease obligations that expire over various terms

watchguard is also a party to several noncancelable and nonrefundable agreements to purchase inventory 
our contractual commitments at december  associated with lease obligations and purchase obligations  net of future minimum rental income from subleases of million  are presented below in thousands

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or derivative equity securities in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio or million per issuer at the time of purchase  with the exception of us treasury and agency securities and money market funds  which are exempt from this size limitation 
our policy limits all investments to those that mature in two years or less  with the average maturity of our investments equal to one year or less 
the securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly affected by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio  which is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk 
all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses 
while we incurred some expenses in foreign currencies during and and expect to continue to do so in the future  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be material to us 
although we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  we may do so in the future 
in addition  we may be required to denominate our sales in foreign currencies at some point in the future to remain competitive
