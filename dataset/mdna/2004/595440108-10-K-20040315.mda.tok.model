total deposits also increased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  shareholders common equity stood at million at year end up from its million level one year earlier 
factors contributing to the increase in shareholders common equity included  the million of net income generated for the year  a million increase due to shares issued in connection with the merger with ojai valley bank  and the million received for the exercise of stock options 
partially offsetting these increases were  million in dividends paid out during  million paid for the repurchase of common stock outstanding  and a million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income

management expects that the net gain on sale to be realized in will be lower than that achieved in the company took a benefit to provision for loan losses of thousand in compared to a provision expense of thousand in creating a positive pre tax improvement to earnings of million between the two years 
the benefit taken to the provision for loan losses in reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies and charge offs  an improved outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  and an improved outlook for economic activity in general 
the impact of the lower interest rate environment in led to a decline in the company s net interest margin to taxable equivalent from in this was offset by an increase in average earning assets of approximately million  thereby allowing it to show a million increase in net interest income from the prior year 
various other non interest income and expense items showed variances which collectively reduced pre tax income by million 
these are discussed in more detail in the income statement analysis section below 
management considers the following to be the most significant items affecting net income during compared to the impact of the lower interest rate environment in led to a decline in the company s net interest margin to taxable equivalent from in which was offset by an increase in average earning assets of approximately million  thereby allowing it to show a million increase in net interest income from to because of concerns of a pending economic slowdown in  the company added to its loan loss allowance through a charge to provision for loan loss expense of million 
this provision was reduced in to just thousand  thus contributing a million improvement to earnings in the company recorded a non recurring gain on sale of its credit card portfolio of million in salaries and benefits during were million above the levels reflecting especially the company s merger with americorp in september resulting in additional staff expense for involving months of activity compared to months in occupancy expense during was million above the levels reflecting especially the company s merger with americorp in september resulting in additional occupancy expense for involving months of activity compared to months in various other non interest income and expense items showed variances which collectively increased pre tax income by million 
these are discussed in more detail in the income statement analysis section below 
management believes that the primary challenges and risks to the company in are the length of time that the continued low interest rate environment will last and the compression that environment is having on its net interest margin  the ability of the economy to recover and enhance the company s ability to grow its loan portfolio and the ability of the company to develop and execute other means for increasing earning assets if the economy does not recover this year  the ability of the company to favorably resolve problem assets  and the ability of the company to contain salary and benefits costs 
with these challenges and risks come opportunities 
management believes that some of the significant opportunities it has are its ability to fund additional loans due to its liquidity at the present time  its asset and liability maturity and rate structure are such that its net interest margin will improve in a rising rate environment  its expanded presence in ventura county will allow it to take advantage of the large and growing economic base in that part of the territory  and as the company is well capitalized and its stock price performed well  it is well positioned to continue to make strategic acquisitions in selected markets 
other events and items of note in on june   the company signed a definitive agreement the agreement to acquire ojai valley bank ojai through merger 
the agreement provided ojai valley bank shareholders with an election to choose mid state bancshares common stock  cash  or a combination of mid state bancshares common stock and cash that was subject to potential adjustments 
adjustments were then made based on changes in the price of mid state bancshares stock preceding the effective date of the transaction and the necessary pro ration of the stock selections made by ojai shareholders 
half of the consideration provided was in the form of mid state bancshares stock with the balance being in cash 
the transaction closed on october  and is expected to be accretive to earnings in the year the total consideration was valued at approximately million 
the merger was structured to be tax free for the stock portion of the consideration 
it gave the company two additional offices in ventura county located in the communities of ojai and oak view 
it added approximately million in assets and million in deposits to the company s consolidated statement of financial position and enhances its position in the important ventura county market place 
following the completion of the merger with ojai  the board of directors appointed mr 
alan rains to a directorship with the company and the bank 
mr 
rains had served with ojai as its chairman of the board since and had joined the board in he also served as chairman of the loan committee and audit committee and is active in numerous civic organizations 
another significant accomplishment of the company during was the successful implementation of a new check imaging system for its customers 
the fronts and backs of the customers original checks are scanned  creating a permanent digital document which is stored on optical disk  ready to be retrieved and printed at any time 
benefits to the customer include easier statement reconciliation  a ready made filing system for statements and checks  easier income tax preparation  and enhanced research capabilities 
the initial cost of implementing this system was approximately million and has resulted in on going savings to the bank especially in the area of postage expense estimated at between and thousand per month 
additionally  the implementation of check imaging was an important step for the bank to take in order to capture  archive and exchange images of checks to comply with the provisions of the new check truncation act check as it has come to be known which was passed by the federal legislature and signed into law by president bush in october along with the implementation of check imaging  the company also invested million in a new main frame computer hardware configuration during to provide the necessary upgrade to its computing capacity 
its prior main frame  installed in was fully depreciated in mid year and was not projected to have sufficient capacity to handle the bank s increasing requirements 
also during the year  the bank undertook significant steps to improve its retail banking sales efforts 
it developed an automated scorecard system for tracking on a monthly basis its various sales goals for deposit and loan products by office and by officer 
the bank also hired an experienced banking sales officer to manage the sales process 
these actions will allow the bank to track sales performance  more effectively reward high performance  and to motivate when performance is below expectations 
the company s stock repurchase program continued in with  shares repurchased  up from  and  shares repurchased in and  respectively 
the average price paid for the stock over this three year period was  and  respectively 
as of december   the company had shares remaining to repurchase on the original may authorization 
at its regular board meeting of january   the board of directors authorized the re purchase of up to  additional shares 
other items to note include the remodeling of the bank s offices on santa rosa street in san luis obispo  on a street in oxnard and on spring street in paso robles 
construction of the bank s new permanent facility in cambria was completed towards the end of with the grand opening taking place on january  external factors impacting the bank economic conditions at the start of  management noted in last year s annual report that while local conditions would appear to be relatively favorable in the near term  the effects of national and state conditions are likely to be negative 
management does not see a return of robust economic conditions until at least and that will be highly dependent on the outcome of events in the middle east 
interest rates are not expected to rise until at least late and more than likely it is even possible that the federal reserve may  with no other effective tools available to it  lower rates again in their efforts to stimulate the economy 
as the company enters  we note that our outlook for was reasonably accurate 
while gross domestic product did show larger increases in the third and fourth quarter than anticipated at and  respectively  concern over the viability of economic recovery and stubbornly high unemployment rates coupled with low inflation rates led the federal reserve to continue its accommodative stance throughout indeed at the end of june  the federal reserve actually lowered the target on the closely watched federal funds rate by 
entering  management believes that the economy is entering a sustained recovery which will lead to lower unemployment rates  increases in inflation and eventually  a need to raise interest rates to combat fears of excessive growth and inflationary pressures 
management further believes that increases in interest rates will likely take place in the fourth quarter of and or first quarter of amounting to a roughly basis point increase in short term interest rates 
long term interest rates will rise also  albeit at reduced levels compared to short term rates  reflecting a flatter yield curve 
the most comprehensive review of local economic conditions known to management comes from the university of california at santa barbara ucsb economic forecast project 
according to ucsb  gross county product in the tri county area was estimated at billion in  up from the level in the prior year 
adjusted for real dollars  it was up following a growth rate in and in while these rates of growth were down from the double digit increases witnessed in the late s  they have been running better than those exhibited by the state as a whole 
california s real state product was in  in and is estimated to have finally returned to a in expectations for are for further improvements with the real state product growing and the real tri county gross product growing 
the difficulties experienced at the state level have certainly had a negative effect on the local tri county area 
it is estimated by ucsb that the public sector has lost some  jobs in the tri county area  a decline  clearly contributing to the slower growth rate in economic activity experienced locally compared to previous years 
this notwithstanding  the tri counties continue to be fortunate in experiencing significantly lower unemployment rates compared to the near level experienced nationally 
the san luis obispo metropolitan statistical area msa had an unemployment rate of at the end of december with the santa barbara msa at and the ventura msa at 
management expects these levels to fall in as the pace of economic activity improves 
median home prices are at record highs in excess of thousand in santa barbara and ventura counties and just under that level in san luis obispo county 
in spite of numerous residential building projects in the bank s trade area and housing affordability indices in the to range  the local real estate market continues strong with a combination of favorable interest rate levels and demand far outpacing supply 
the strong trends in both residential and non residential real estate continue with no signs of abating 
lenders are more prudent in their lending practices having learned the lessons of the early s and hence building is far less speculative 
management does not see significant risk of a slowdown in real estate in with positive indicators being revealed in the national economic statistics and a solid economic base locally  management is encouraged that should be a very positive year for the economy in the company s trade area 
this optimism  however  must be tempered by the potential for disruption resulting from geopolitical issues surrounding homeland security and terrorism 
as we learned from the terrorist attacks  the wars in afghanistan and iraq  and the international tensions surrounding those episodes  the effects of these episodes on economic activity can be significant 
in spite of this caveat  our local trade area appears to be in a better position at the start of than it was one year earlier 
competitive factors competitive pressures from other financial institutions continue to be intense both in the company s trade area and throughout the nation 
many banks are suffering from insufficient loan volumes and have become very aggressive on the pricing of those good credits available 
it should also be noted that the trend toward consolidation of banking assets exhibited over the past few years in california continued in statewide  through november  banks were merged out of existence or liquidated during the year and new banks commenced operation 
analysis of statement of financial position loans the bank experienced an increase in net loans from  million at the end of  to  million at the end of this represents an increase in the loan portfolio of million following the million increase in approximately million of this increase is a result of the merger with ojai valley bank 
the loan portfolio represents approximately of the bank s assets 
additionally  loans held for sale which are single family residential mortgages pending sale total million at the end of  down from million one year earlier 
the graph below displays the trend over the past five years in the various components of the loan portfolio 
construction loans have risen from their level five years earlier million at december  compared to million at year end real estate loans generally trended up from million at the end of to million at the end of home equity credit lines have generally increased from million at the end of compared to million at the end of consumer loans installment and credit reserve have decreased from million at december  to million at year end which is due to the sale in december of the company s credit card receivables 
commercial loans have grown in recent years through  but fell to million at december  agricultural production loans decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of the bank expects to continue to emphasize all types of lending activity in order to diversify the risk in its portfolio 
economic activity in the central coast will determine the types of credit the bank will be able to extend and hence its ability to achieve this objective 
mid state bancshares trends in loan categories performance graph the bank s allowance for losses stands at million  or of gross loans  and represents losses not yet realized  but inherent in the loan portfolio and on unfunded commitments 
approximately thousand of the allowance was acquired through the merger with ojai valley bank 
the allowance for losses is down from the million at december  the year end balance now represents of non performing loans which is up slightly from at the end of a five year review of activity in the allowance for losses and an allocation by loan type of the allowance is shown in the tables below

the level of non accrual loans at the end of is centered primarily in two real estate secured loans total million 
management has established specific reserves that would offset potential losses  if any  arising from less than full recovery of the loans from the supporting collateral 
recoveries in of loans previously charged off totaled million compared to charge offs of million taken during the year resulting in net charge offs of million 
this compares to net charge offs incurred of million and million in and  respectively 
the bank anticipates that charge offs actual losses will continue during it is unlikely that recoveries would exceed charge offs in the coming year 
with the combination of the collateral securing the problem loans and the size of the allowance for losses  management feels that the allowance is sufficient to cover inherent losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance and also employs an independent third party loan review group to  among other things  review the reasonableness of individual asset classifications 
management  as necessary  adjusts the allowance on a regular basis 
the allowance is also examined annually by one or more of the bank s regulatory bodies including the fdic and dfi 
during the fourth quarter of  based on its review of the allowance  management took a benefit to the provision for loan losses of million resulting in a net benefit to the provision for loan losses of just under million for the full year 
this action reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies and charge offs  an improved outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  and an improved outlook for economic activity in general 
the need for additional provision for loan losses or for further benefit to the provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
the allowance for losses consists of a statistically allocated portion and a specifically allocated portion 
the total of these components is considered adequate to provide for losses  which can be reasonably anticipated 
however  since these amounts are based on estimates  ultimate losses relating to these loans may vary and management believes that qualitative factors make it prudent to carry a reasonable level of an unallocated portion to absorb losses in excess of the allocated portion 
qualitative factors considered include  but are not limited to  portfolio composition  concentrations  off balance sheet risks  delinquencies and non accruals  criticized and classified loans  non performing loans  gross and net loan losses  changes in lending function  changes in management  the bank s organizational structure  the special assets group  lending and credit approval authorities  loan officer training  the credit review function  and real estate appraisal policies 
a summary of maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates at december  is shown in the table below

see footnote no 
to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed composition of the investment portfolio 
the treasury and agency portion of the portfolio increased by million from one year ago 
the bank increased its holdings in the municipal bond portfolio from million at the end of  to million at the end of the us treasury portion of the portfolio increased as well by million as did the federal agencies by million from december  to december  mortgage back securities increased million 
in total  the bank increased its investment portfolio from million at the end of to million at the end of  a million increase 
approximately million of this increase relates to the portfolio acquired through the merger with ojai valley bank 
the balance of the increase reflects the growth in deposits not being fully deployed into the loan portfolio 
the bank may segregate its portfolio into three categories a trading portfolio which is carried at market value  with changes in market value reflected in the income statement  a held to maturity portfolio which is carried at amortized cost  with changes in market value having no impact on the financial statements and an available for sale portfolio which is carried at market value  with changes in market value reflected in comprehensive income 
the bank holds no securities that should be classified as trading or held to maturity securities 
the bank has determined that since its securities may be sold prior to maturity because of interest rate changes  to meet liquidity needs  or to better match the re pricing characteristics of funding sources  that the entire portfolio should be classified as available for sale 
adjustments to the available for sale portfolio for changes in market values resulted in an unrealized gain of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  compared to an unrealized gain of million at december   net of related taxes 
purchases exceeded maturities and sales over the full year and the total investment portfolio increased by million from the end of to the end of shown below is a summary maturity distribution of the investment portfolio  which is all classified as available for sale  by type and weighted taxable equivalent yield as of december  expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

the balance represents two properties  million of which was a foreclosed commercial real estate loan on non accrual and the balance represents a property acquired in the recent ojai valley bank acquisition 
future oreo activity will depend  among other things  on how many borrowers the bank may need to foreclose upon  and the strength of the real estate market and general economic activity 
goodwill and core deposit intangibles goodwill totaled million at december  compared to million one year earlier 
the increase of is a result of the acquisition of ojai valley bank that was completed on october  on an annual basis  the company tests its goodwill for impairment 
the goodwill is entirely attributable to the company s community banking segment 
results of this test have indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the past two years  through  in which the testing commenced 
core deposit intangibles total million at december  compared to million one year earlier 
of the year end amounts  million represents the amortized value of the core deposit intangible created with the american commercial bank acquisition and million represents the core deposit intangible created upon the acquisition of ojai valley bank 
the core deposit intangibles represent the fair value of long term deposit relationships acquired and is being amortized over expected useful economic lives of and years  respectively 
deposits while the bank is competitive with major institutions in terms of its structure of interest rates on deposit products offered  management was not overly aggressive during in terms of pricing to attract additional deposits  a decision which reflects the bank s strong liquidity at the present time 
as discussed in the income statement analysis  most of the bank s deposit rates have fallen in concert with the general decline in rates 
a comparison of the rates paid on the bank s deposit products at december  and is as follows selected quoted interest rates change demand deposits now account better over  money market deposits over  passbook savings account individual retirement account year term time deposit  month term wall street journal prime rate average deposits grew dramatically in reflecting growth at mid state bank trusts existing offices and the acquisition of ojai valley bank on october  which had deposits of approximately million at the time of the acquisition

while all time deposits are somewhat more rate sensitive than the bank s other deposit categories  the smaller time deposit balances tend to be more stable and less sensitive to absolute rate levels than do time deposits of  or more 
approximately of the bank s time deposits mature within one year and would be potentially subject to a change in rate on their maturity date

the bank had outstanding borrowings of million and million at december  and  respectively  under the us treasury tax and loan note account program

there were no other borrowings that were acquired as part of the ojai valley bank acquisition 
capital capital ratios for commercial banks and their holding companies in the united states are generally calculated using three different formulas 
these calculations are referred to as the leverage ratio and two risk based calculations known as tier one risk based capital ratio and the total risk based capital ratio 
the company and the bank are subject to certain standards concerning these ratios 
these standards were developed through the joint efforts of banking authorities from different countries around the world 
the standards essentially take into account the fact that different types of assets have different levels of risk associated with them 
further  they take into account the off balance sheet exposures of banks when assessing capital adequacy 
the leverage ratio calculation simply divides common stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and certain other intangibles that a bank may have by the total assets of the bank 
in the tier one risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is the total risk weighted assets of the bank 
risk weighted assets are determined by segregating all the assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio again uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses  long term capital debt  preferred stock and other instruments 
summarized below are the capital ratios at december  and  for both mid state bancshares and mid state bank trust 
additionally  the standards for a well capitalized institution  as defined by the federal banking agencies  are displayed 
mid state bancshares mid state bank trust minimum regulatory standard well capitalized regulatory standard leverage ratio tier one risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio while it is the intent of management to continue to maintain strong capital ratios  the board of directors has initiated a stock repurchase program and increased the quarterly dividend payments in an effort to further utilize its equity and enhance shareholder value 
without deducting for goodwill and other intangibles from equity  two other commonly followed ratios related to capital have trended as follows over the past three years 
dividend payout ratio average common equity to average assets liquidity the focus of the bank s liquidity management is to ensure its ability to meet cash requirements 
sources of liquidity include cash  due from bank balances net of federal reserve requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  fed funds sold  investment securities net of pledging requirements  loan repayments  deposits and fed funds borrowing lines 
typical demands on liquidity are deposit run off from demand deposits and savings accounts  maturing time deposits  which are not renewed  and anticipated funding under credit commitments to customers 
the bank has adequate liquidity at the present time 
its loan to deposit ratio at year end was versus one year earlier 
the bank normally strives for a loan to deposit ratio in the to range 
the bank s internally calculated liquidity ratio stands at at december   which is above its minimum policy of 
with the weaker loan demand experienced in recent years coupled with continued strong growth in the bank s deposit base  the bank has a stronger liquidity position and lower loan to deposit ratio than it would normally target 
management is not aware of any trend  demand  commitment or event that would result in a material change in the company s liquidity at the present time 
capital commitments as of december   the company does not have any material commitment for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations as of december   the company had the following contractual obligations 
less than one year one to three years three to five years over five years total long term debt   mortgages payable operating leases      total contractual obligations     off balance sheet and other related party transactions as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company is contingently liable for letter of credit accommodations made to its customers in the ordinary course of business totaling million at december   down from million one year earlier 
additionally  the company has undisbursed loan commitments  also made in the ordinary course of business  totaling million  which was up from the million outstanding one year earlier 
the company has an allowance for losses unfunded commitments totaling  and  at december  and  respectively  to cover losses inherent in its letter of credit accommodations and undisbursed loan commitments 
there are no special purpose entity spe trusts  corporations  or other legal entities established by mid state which reside off balance sheet 
there are no other off balance sheet items other than the aforementioned items related to letter of credit accommodations and undisbursed loan commitments 
as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company does make loans and leases to related parties directors and officers in the ordinary course of business at prevailing rates and terms 
these loans and leases totaled million at the end of and income statement analysis net interest income and interest rate risk net interest income is the difference between interest and fees earned on all earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for was million  up from million recorded in and million in the components of net interest income change in response to both changes in rate  average balance and mix of both earning assets and liabilities

first  the company experienced an increase in its average earning assets outstanding of million 
the increase was divided amongst a net increase in average loans of million  an increase in average investments of million and an increase in average federal funds sold of million 
second  while the company s average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  earning assets increased by a larger million 
the increases in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are partly attributable to the acquisition of ojai valley bank on october  which affected the averages of these categories through the influence of their balances for the last two months of the year in with no corresponding influence in third  interest rates were lower in compared to the average for for example  the prime rate averaged in compared to in during there was a million decrease in interest income along with a decrease of million in interest expense compared to the resulting million increase in net interest income for was a result of a number of dynamics affecting both average balance and interest rate considerations 
first  the company experienced an increase in its average earning assets outstanding of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the net increase in average loans  which were up by million coupled with an increase in average investments of million and an increase in average federal funds sold of million 
second  while the company s average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  earning assets increased by a larger million 
both increases in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are largely attributable to the acquisition of american commercial bank on september  which had a larger affect on the averages of these categories in than it did in third  interest rates were considerably lower in compared to the average for for example  the prime rate averaged in compared to in fourth  there was a recovery of interest totaling million in on a loan previously charged off representing prior years interest which was recognized into interest income and unrelated to either volume or rate considerations for that year 
the bank expects its risk exposure to changes in interest rates to remain manageable and well within acceptable policy ranges 
a recent review as of the end of of the potential changes in the bank s net interest income over a month time horizon showed that it could fluctuate under extreme alternative rate scenarios from between and of the base case rates unchanged of million 
the bank s policy is to maintain a structure of assets and liabilities which are such that net interest income will not vary more than plus or minus of the base forecast over the next months 
management expects that its exposure to interest rate risk is manageable and it will continue to strive for an optimal trade off between risk and earnings 
the following table presents a summary of the bank s net interest income forecasted for the coming months under alternative interest rate scenarios 
change from base rates down very significant prime down to over months rates down significant prime down to over months rates down modestly prime down to over months base case rates unchanged prime unchanged at over months rates up modestly prime up to over months rates up aggressive prime up to over months rates up very aggressive prime up to over months net interest income under the above scenarios is influenced by the characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
in the case of now  savings and money market deposits total billion interest is based on rates set at the discretion of management ranging from to 
in a downward rate environment  there is a limit to how far these deposit instruments can be re priced and this behavior is similar to that of fixed rate instruments 
in an upward rate environment  the magnitude and timing of changes in rates on these deposits is assumed to be more reflective of variable rate instruments 
it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitors behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior  and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the bank s net interest income 
therefore the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
historically  the bank has been able to manage its net interest income in a fairly narrow range reflecting the bank s relative insensitivity to interest rate changes 
the impact of prepayment behavior on mortgages  real estate loans  mortgage backed securities  securities with call features  etc 
is not considered material to the sensitivity analysis 
over the last years  the bank s net interest margin which is net interest income divided by average earning assets of the bank has ranged from a low of to a high of not taxable equivalent 
the bank s net interest margin in of is at the low end of this range by historical standards  coming off the higher levels experienced in of 
this is a result of both the lower level of interest rates and the change in mix of earning assets the bank now has a smaller portion in loans vis vis investment securities compared to when the margin was at its widest level 
the net interest margin under the alternative scenarios ranges from to 
management feels this range of scenarios  while lower than historical standards  is consistent with current experience and interest rate levels  but no assurances can be given that actual future experience will fall within this range 
the bank s exposure with respect to interest rate derivatives  exchange rate fluctuations  and or commodity price movements is nil 
the bank does not own any instruments within these markets 
provision for loan losses the company made provisions to the allowance for loan losses of thousand and million in and  respectively 
in however  it reduced the allowance for loan losses by thousand through a benefit to the provision for loan losses 
this action reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies and charge offs  an improved outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  and an improved outlook for economic activity in general 
the need for additional provision for loan losses or for further benefit to the provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
non interest income non interest income for totaled million compared to million in and million in service charges on deposit accounts increased million to million in versus this followed an increase of million in over the increase in over reflects an increase in accounts and the merger with ojai valley bank  but no significant increases in service charge rates 
the increase in over was mostly related to increases in service charge rates  coupled with an increase in the number of deposits accounts acquired in the american commercial bank merger 
commissions  fees and other service charges increased by million in over after a million increase in the increase in related to several items including a thousand increase in income from the trust and investment division  a thousand increase in mortgage loan processing fees  a thousand increase in real estate loan servicing fees  a thousand increase in debit card fees and a thousand increase in atm fees and surcharges 
the majority of the increase in was primarily related to increased fee income from its debit cards of thousand along with increased fee income from its trust and investment division activities of thousand 
in addition  approximately thousand of the increase in was related to the bank s mastercard merchant fees 
the balance is related to modest increases across several other fee areas and the fact that reflected three months of activity generated from the newly acquired american commercial bank  whereas in  mid state benefited from their inclusion for the full year 
all other sources of income increased to million in  up from million in and million in the increase in of million is largely a result of the refinance boom which dramatically increased the company s mortgage banking activity resulting in net gains on sale of loans held for sale of million compared to million in the prior year a million increase 
also contributing to the increase was a one time gain on the sale of bank property of thousand and thousand realized from the on going commissions on the sale of property formerly owned by mid coast land company 
results in reflect the gain on sale of the bank s credit card portfolio in the amount of million  thus providing the largest portion of the explanation for the decline from to non interest expense total non interest expense for was million  up from million in and million in in comparing results across the three year periods  it should be noted that reflects three months of activity generated by the overhead created from the acquisition of the former american commercial bank 
results for reflect a full year 
results in reflect two months of overhead created by the acquisition of ojai valley bank which was not reflected in prior years 
economies of scale were realized from the mergers and it is estimated that the expenses of the combined mid state americorp are now approximately million per year lower than the sum of the two institutions would have been on a stand alone basis 
similarly  for mid state ojai expenses are estimated to be approximately million annually lower than the sum of the two institutions on a stand alone basis 
in both mergers  savings have been realized due to reduced data processing costs  reduced salary and benefit costs  reduced directors fees  reduced insurance costs  and other similar savings 
salaries and employee benefits increased by million in compared to after having increased by million in over the increase in over reflected a thousand increase in total salaries paid along with a million increase in employee benefit incentive expense reflecting both the improved performance of the bank and enhancements made to the plan to remain competitive in recruiting  hiring and retaining the most qualified staff possible 
the increase in over related to an increase in salaries of approximately million with the balance representing health benefits cost increases 
management considers containment of salaries and benefits costs in to be one of its top challenges 
a number of factors are continuing to create unusually strong upward pressure on these costs  especially in the areas of medical benefits  workers compensation costs and competitive wages 
the company is addressing this by focusing on ways of becoming more efficient in its processes and using technology wherever possible to hold down staffing requirements 
occupancy expense increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in over reflected increased rental payments on leased buildings  capital expenditures for computer equipment  atm s and new signage due to the bank s name change and the merger with american commercial bank 
the new equipment and signage was placed into service in the middle of and occupancy expense increased as these items are depreciated over useful lives of between and years 
the increase in reflects primarily increases in facilities maintenance of thousand  increases in facilities rents of thousand and increases in depreciation expense of thousand 
the purchase of a new mainframe computer system during the middle of did not have a significant impact on depreciation costs because of the parallel reduction in depreciation expense from the retirement of the old system 
the purchase of new item imaging equipment which is improving checking account processing and research capabilities for customers  along with improving the efficiency of the bank  did have a modest impact on depreciation expense for the year 
advertising and promotion expenditures were million in following charges of million in and million in expenditures in reflect the impact of the company s name change to mid state bank trust on its th anniversary celebration in mid and the merger with american commercial bank later that year 
expenditures in and were fairly constant 
the company is however planning expanded marketing campaigns during and expects this category to increase by approximately million in general office expenditures were million in compared to million in and million in this category includes primarily charges for stationery and supplies  telephone expenses  and postage 
mangement does not expect an increase in this expenditure area in as it has taken a number of steps to hold down costs related to telephone expenditures and expenditures on stationery and supplies 
moreover  the implementation in of item imaging will reduce postage costs 
merchant processing and data processing charges were million in compared to million in and million in management s expectation for is that merchant processing and data processing expense will increase due to additional activity and volume associated with an improving economy 
professional services were million in  million in and million in the increase in over relates primarily to the utilization of outside consultants to develop enhancements to the company s retail banking sales efforts 
the increase in compared to is primarily a result of a thousand increase in outside legal expenses  an increase in messenger service cost of thousand  and increases in audit  accounting and utilization of outside consultants amounting to thousand 
regulatory assessments charges for fdic assessments and dfi fees have grown with the size of the bank over the past three years at   and thousand in   and  respectively 
this trend is likely to continue as the bank grows 
other operating expenses increased in to million up from million in and million in the increase in compared to reflects an increase in the provision for losses on unfunded commitments  an increase in other real estate owned expense and an increase in interest charged off from prior periods on special assets 
taxes book tax expense amounted to million in  million in and million in while the statutory tax rate of the company is  the actual rate accrued was  and in   and  respectively 
the primary reason for the difference relates to the tax exempt income generated by the company s municipal bond portfolio 
as described in footnote no 
to the financial statements  the company has deferred tax assets primarily related to the timing difference associated with charge offs and provisions for losses on certain loans and with the timing difference on deferred compensation 
subsidiary activity mid coast land company mid coast land company recorded a profit of thousand in compared to a loss during of thousand and earnings during of thousand 
the gain in primarily relates to the on going commissions on the sale of property formerly owned by mid coast land company 
the loss in was related to the write off of a note carried by the subsidiary to a developer for which no allowance had been provided based on the conditions of the loan prior to mid coast land company is no longer engaged in real estate development activity  having sold its final property which closed during the first quarter of it currently records residual activity resulting from prior years operations

critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as  disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
management believes that the most significant subjective judgements that it is required to make include the following allowance for losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance and also employs an independent third party loan review group to  among other things  review the adequacy of the allowance and make recommendations 
management  as necessary  adjusts the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for losses unfunded commitments  on a regular basis 
these adjustments are made through a charge to expense or a benefit in the provision for loan losses on the income statement 
the allowance is also examined annually by one or more of the bank s regulatory bodies including the fdic and dfi 
the need for additional provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
fair value 
where applicable  the company is required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap to disclose the fair value of financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate those fair values 
also  the fair value calculated on collateral supporting the bank s extensions of credit eg appraisals on the property securing real estate loans can have a significant effect on the determination of the adequacy of the the allowance for losses noted above 
wherever possible  fair value used by the company equals quoted market price  as for example with its investment securities portfolio  if available 
if it is not available  fair value is estimated by the company using quoted market prices for similar assets 
fair value of other instruments involves discounting future cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturity and credit characteristics 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other then temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
taxes 
the company estimates its quarterly effective income tax rate based upon a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the expected revenues for the year and the product mix of revenue  and the ratio of permanent differences to total revenue 
any changes to the estimated rate are made prospectively in accordance with apb interim financial reporting 
additionally  a valuation allowance  which was zero at december  and  provides for deferred taxes that are not anticipated to be offset by taxable income projected for the next months 
a valuation allowance is based on estimates by management which can change over time
