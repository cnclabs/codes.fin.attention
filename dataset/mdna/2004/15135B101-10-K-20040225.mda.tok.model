item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below under factors that may affect future results and the trading price of our common stock 
overview we are a multi line managed care organization that provides medicaid and medicaid related programs to organizations and individuals through government subsidized programs  including medicaid  supplemental security income ssi and the state children s health insurance program schip 
we have health plans in wisconsin  texas  indiana  new jersey and ohio 
we also provide specialty services in texas  california  arizona  colorado  wisconsin and indiana 
these specialty services include behavioral health  nurse triage and pharmacy compliance 
we have organized this management s discussion and analysis to address the following recent acquisitions  critical accounting policies  revenue and expense discussion and key metrics  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual commitments  and regulatory capital and dividend restrictions 
recent acquisitions effective january   we commenced operations in ohio through the acquisition of the medicaid related assets of family health plan  inc  a subsidiary of mercy health partners  for a purchase price of million 
this transaction includes the right to serve up to  of fhp s medicaid members in toledo  ohio  a new market for us 
while we did incur start up cost in  the results of operations of this entity will be included in our consolidated financial statements beginning january  effective august   we acquired the medicaid related contract rights of hmo blue texas in the san antonio  texas market 
this transaction allows us to serve approximately  additional members in the state 
our purchase price was million 
we allocated the entire purchase price to acquired contracts 
the contracts are being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of five years  the expected period of benefit 
during  we acquired a ownership interest in group practice affiliates  llc in march and in august 
gpa  a behavioral healthcare services company  serves over  individuals in five states through a combination of networks  groups and schools  including a portion of our membership 
this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to provide diversified medical services to the managed medicaid population 
we paid an aggregate purchase price of million for gpa  resulting in goodwill of million 
in march  we purchased certain assets of scriptassist  a medication compliance company 
we are administering the purchased contracts under the scriptassist name 
scriptassist uses various approaches and medical expertise to promote adherence to prescription drugs 
the asset acquisition is consistent with our strategy to provide diversified medical services to the managed medicaid population 

table of contents the purchase price of  was allocated to acquired contracts 
we are amortizing the contracts on a straight line basis over five years  the expected period of benefit 
on december   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of university health plans  inc from university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey 
in october we exercised our option to purchase the remaining 
uhp is a managed health plan operating in counties in new jersey 
we paid an aggregate purchase price of million for our interest in uhp 
the purchase price allocation resulted in intangible assets of million representing provider contracts and purchased contract rights  which are being amortized over years  and goodwill of million 
in june  we entered into an agreement with texas universities health plan inc to purchase the schip contracts in three texas service areas  thereby adding approximately  members to our texas health plan 
the cash purchase price of  was recorded as purchased contract rights  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years  the expected period of benefit 
with our acquisition of gpa and our purchase of scriptassist assets  we began operating in two segments medicaid managed care and specialty services 
the medicaid managed care segment consists of our health plans  including all of the functions needed to operate them 
the specialty services segment consists of our specialty services  including our behavioral health  nurse triage and pharmacy compliance functions 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
two of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
medical claims liabilities our medical costs include claims paid  claims adjudicated but not yet paid  estimates for claims received but not yet adjudicated  estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims 
we  together with our independent actuaries  estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments  if necessary  are reflected in the period known 
in applying this policy  our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the determination of the required estimates 
while we believe these estimates are appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
for example  a increase or decrease in our health benefits ratio would have affected net earnings by million for the year ended december  the estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 

table of contents the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  balance  january acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid balance  december acquisitions in and include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of uhp 
acquisitions in include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of the remaining shares of superior healthplan 
changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development in all of our markets  including lower than anticipated utilization of medical services 
intangible assets we have made several acquisitions since that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets 
these intangible assets primarily consist of purchased contract rights  provider contracts and goodwill 
purchased contract rights are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from to months 
provider contracts are amortized using the straight line method over months 
our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
impairment of an intangible asset is triggered when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount of the intangible asset and related goodwill 
if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset and goodwill may be permanently impaired  the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset and goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity 
our management must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in addition  we will perform an impairment analysis of intangible assets more frequently based on other factors 
these factors would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 
we did not recognize any impairment losses during the years ended december   or revenue and expense discussion and key metrics we are providing certain non gaap financial measures in this discussion of revenues and expenses which exclude the impact of a newly enacted premium tax which totaled million in we believe that these figures are helpful in allowing the reader to more accurately assess the ongoing nature of our 
table of contents operations and measure our performance more consistently 
we use the presented non gaap financial measures internally to focus management on period to period changes in our business 
therefore  we believe that this information is meaningful in addition to the information contained in the gaap presentation of financial information 
the presentation of this additional non gaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 
revenues we generate revenues in our medicaid managed care segment primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to provide health benefits to our members 
we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts 
we generally receive premiums during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
our specialty services companies generate revenues from a variety of sources 
our behavioral health company generates revenue via capitation payments from our health plans and others 
it also receives fees for the direct provision of care and certain school programs in arizona 
our pharmacy compliance program receives fee income from the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals 
nursewise receives fees from health plans  physicians and other organizations for providing continuous access to nurse advisors 
premiums collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue 
premiums due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts 
as we generally receive premiums during the month in which services are provided  the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total premium revenue and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial position or results of operations 
the primary drivers of our increasing revenue have been membership growth in our medicaid managed care segment and our entry into the specialty services segment 
we have increased our membership through internal growth and acquisitions 
from december  to december   we increased our membership by 
the following table sets forth our membership by state december  wisconsin texas indiana new jersey total the following table sets forth our membership by line of business december  medicaid schip ssi total in  our membership increased by  members in texas due to the purchase of contract rights from hmo blue texas 
our membership increased in all our markets from additions to our provider network  increases in counties served and growth in the number of medicaid beneficiaries 

table of contents in  our membership increased by  members in texas due to the purchase of schip contract rights from texas universities health plan 
in addition  two smaller plans exited the austin  texas market 
as a result  our texas plan increased its membership by  lives 
this increase includes  lives that we are managing for the state of texas on an interim basis and that will become part of a reprocurement process scheduled for mid we entered the new jersey market through our acquisition of uhp 
membership increases in our wisconsin and indiana markets resulted from additions to our provider network and growth in the number of medicaid beneficiaries 
operating expenses our operating expenses include medical costs  cost of services  and general and administrative expenses 
our medical costs include payments to physicians  hospitals  and other providers for healthcare and specialty product claims 
medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience 
as part of this review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns  membership  products and inpatient hospital trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available 
we utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly 
while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound  we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 
our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred 
our health benefits ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 
the table below depicts our health benefits ratios by member category and in total year ended december  medicaid and schip ssi total gaap total non gaap  excluding effect of premium tax our medicaid and schip ratio decreased in from due primarily to initiatives to reduce inappropriate emergency department usage and to establish preferred drug lists such as generics 
the addition of the ssi members in new jersey in december has caused our total health benefits ratio to increase slightly 
the health benefits ratio for ssi is affected by a low membership base and is subject to greater volatility as a percentage of premiums although relatively immaterial in total dollars to total medical costs 
we expect the health benefits ratio for ssi to decrease as these members become fully integrated into our medical management programs  as our membership base grows within the state of new jersey and as our membership base grows in other markets 
our cost of services expenses include all direct costs to support the local functions responsible for generation of our services revenues 
these expenses primarily consist of the salaries and wages of the physicians  clinicians  therapists and teachers who provide the services and expenses related to the clinics and supporting facilities and equipment used to provide services 
our general and administrative expenses primarily reflect wages and benefits and other administrative costs related to health plans  specialty companies and our centralized functions that support all of our business units 
the major centralized functions are claims processing  information systems and finance 
in september  concurrent with a rate increase received in one state  we began to be charged premium taxes by that state 
premium taxes are classified as general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expense ratio represents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to drive those 
table of contents revenues 
the following table sets forth the general and administrative expense ratios by business segment and in total year ended december  gaap non gaap medicaid managed care specialty services total excluding effect of premium tax the improvement in the medicaid managed care general and administrative expenses ratio reflects growth in membership and leveraging of our overall infrastructure 
this ratio decreased in from despite the levying of the premium tax from one of our states which resulted in million additional general and administrative expense  increased spending on tax planning initiatives and start up costs  primarily in the fourth quarter  related to our new health plan in ohio 
the specialty services ratio may vary depending on the various contracts and nature of the service provided and will have a higher general and administrative expense ratio than the medicaid managed care segment 
other income expense other income expense consists principally of investment and other income and interest expense 
investment income is derived from our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
information about our investments is included below under liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense reported in reflects mortgage interest on our corporate headquarters building and fees paid to a bank in conjunction with our credit facility 
interest expense reported in reflected fees paid to a bank in conjunction with our credit facility 
interest expense reported in primarily reflected interest paid on our subordinated notes  which we repaid in full in december

in addition  we received premium rate increases ranging from to  or on a composite basis across our markets 
services revenues increased due to an increase in our non risk ssi membership in our texas market and the addition of services revenues of gpa beginning march  operating expenses medical costs increased due to the growth in our membership as discussed above 
our medicaid and schip health benefits ratio decreased to from due in part to our initiatives to reduce emergency department usage and to establish preferred drug lists as previously discussed 
cost of services increased due to the inclusion of direct costs related to the services revenues of gpa beginning march  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to expenses for additional staff to support our membership growth and expansion into the specialty services segment 
additionally  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the institution of a premium tax  tax planning costs incurred during the year and ohio start up costs previously discussed 
other income other income expense in included a one time dividend of million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment 
excluding this one time gain  other income increased from with higher investment balances in partially offset by a lower interest rate environment and interest expense on our corporate headquarters mortgage 

table of contents income tax expense our effective tax rate in was  compared to in the decrease was primarily due to increased levels of tax exempt interest income and a lower effective state tax rate 
earnings per share and shares outstanding our earnings per share calculations reflect an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in primarily resulting from the follow on offering of  shares sold in august year ended december  compared to year ended december  summarized comparative financial data for and are as follows in millions change premium revenue services revenue total revenues medical costs cost of services general and administrative expenses earnings from operations investment and other income  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense minority interest net earnings diluted earnings per common share revenues premiums for the year ended december  increased due to organic growth in our existing markets  the purchase of the texas schip contracts and the inclusion of one month of revenues of uhp

services revenues for the year ended december  increased due to increases in our non risk ssi membership in our texas market 
operating expenses medical costs for the year ended december  increased reflecting the growth in our membership 
cost of services increased  from the comparable period in while the non risk ssi membership increased between periods  the cost of services remained flat as we leveraged existing systems to support the increased membership 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased reflecting a higher level of wages and related expenses for additional staff to support our membership growth 
other income other income for the year ended december  increased million from a majority of the increase was due to the receipt of a one time dividend of million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment 
in addition  investment income increased due to a larger 
table of contents amount of dollars invested  and interest expense decreased year over year due to the repayment of our subordinated debt in december income tax expense for the year ended december  we recorded income tax expense at an effective tax rate of 
this compares to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  our effective tax rate decreased year over year due to increased levels of tax exempt interest income and a lower effective state tax rate 
earnings per share and shares outstanding our earnings per share calculations reflect an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in resulting from the follow on offering of  shares sold in june and  shares sold in our initial public offering in december liquidity and capital resources in august  we closed our follow on public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
we received net proceeds totaling million from this offering 
we intend to use our net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions of businesses  assets and technologies that are complementary to our business 
we may use proceeds to acquire medicaid and schip businesses  specialty services businesses and contract rights in order to increase our membership and to expand our business into new service areas 
in june  we closed our follow on public offering  whereby  shares were sold by selling stockholders and  shares were sold by us at per share 
we received net proceeds of million from this offering 
in december  we closed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
we received net proceeds of million 
prior to this offering  we financed our operations and growth through private equity and debt financings and internally generated funds 
our operating activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in the increases in and were due to continued profitability  increases in membership  increases in medical claims liabilities and the timing of premium receipts 
our investing activities used cash of million in and million in and provided cash of million in the largest component of investing activities related to increases in our investment portfolio 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our investment guidelines 
net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases  sales and maturities 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities with an average duration of years 
cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds  commercial paper and instruments of the us treasury 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash 
the average annualized portfolio yield was for the year ended december  and for exclusive of a one time dividend of million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment 
our yield decreased due to our investment in tax advantaged securities beginning in the fourth quarter of  as well as a decrease in the overall interest rate environment 
our financing activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our public offering completed in august during  financing cash flows primarily consisted of the issuance of common stock through our offering completed in june during  financing cash flows primarily consisted of the issuance of common stock through our initial public offering net of the repayment of subordinated notes with million of our proceeds 

table of contents we spent million and million in and  respectively  on capital assets consisting primarily of new software  software and hardware upgrades  and furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements related to office and market expansions 
in  we purchased million of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements due to the addition of the austin and san antonio markets and the expansion of the wisconsin market 
we anticipate spending million on additional capital expenditures in related to office and market expansions and system upgrades 
in july  we purchased the building in which our corporate headquarters in st 
louis  missouri is located for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we financed a portion of the purchase price through an million non recourse mortgage loan arrangement 
the mortgage bears interest at the prevailing prime rate less 
at december   our mortgage bore interest at 
at december   we had working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  of million as compared to million at december  our working capital is negative due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and  therefore  are classified as long term 
our investment policies are also designed to provide liquidity and preserve capital 
we manage our short term and long term investments to ensure that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund working capital as needed 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december  long term investments were million at december  and million at december   including restricted deposits of million and million  respectively 
cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
based on our operating plan  we expect that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments  cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures for at least months from the date of this filing 
contractual commitments our principal contractual obligations at december  consisted of obligations under operating leases and mortgage obligations for our corporate headquarters 
the non cancelable lease and mortgage payments over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years debt operating leases total we have a million revolving line of credit facility with lasalle bank na lasalle which expires in may the facility has interest rates based on lasalle s prime rate or libor 
the line is secured by the common stock of our subsidiaries 
the facility includes financial covenants  including requirements of minimum ebitda and minimum tangible net worth 
we are required to obtain lasalle s consent to any proposed acquisition that would result in a violation of any of the covenants contained in the facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and no funds were outstanding on the facility 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as managed care organizations  these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us 
generally  the amount of 
table of contents dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of million 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum risk based capital requirements for insurance companies  managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage 
as of december   our wisconsin  texas and ohio health plans were in compliance with risk based capital requirements 
indiana has adopted risk based capital rules that will take effect as of december  if adopted by new jersey  risk based capital may increase the minimum capital required for our health plan in new jersey 
we continue to monitor the requirements in indiana and new jersey and do not expect that they will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect on our financial position and results of operations can be found in note to our annual consolidated financial statements under the caption recent accounting pronouncements included elsewhere herein 
forward looking statements this filing contains forward looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
we have attempted to identify these statements by terminology including believe  anticipate  plan  expect  estimate  intend  seek  goal  may  will  should  can  continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements include statements about our market opportunity  our growth strategy  competition  expected activities and future acquisitions  investments and the adequacy of our available cash resources 
these statements may be found in the sections of this filing entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
readers are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including economic  regulatory  competitive and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual results may differ from projections or estimates due to a variety of important factors 
our results of operations and projections of future earnings depend in large part on accurately predicting and effectively managing health benefits and other operating expenses 
a variety of factors  including competition  changes in health care practices  changes in federal or state laws and regulations or their interpretations  inflation  provider contract changes  new technologies  government imposed surcharges  taxes or assessments  reduction in provider payments by governmental payers  major epidemics  disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare  such as major healthcare providers inability to maintain their operations  may in the future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating expenses 
governmental action or business conditions could result in premium revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other operating expenses 
once set  premiums are generally fixed for one year periods and  accordingly  unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be recovered through higher premiums 
the expiration  cancellation or suspension of our medicaid managed care contracts by the state governments would also negatively impact us 
due to these factors and risks  we cannot give assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 

table of contents factors that may affect future results and the trading price of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  in which case you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information in this filing  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 
risks related to being a regulated entity reduction in medicaid and schip funding could substantially reduce our profitability 
most of our revenues come from medicaid and schip premiums 
the base premium rate paid by each state differs  depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits  a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix and member eligibility categories 
future levels of medicaid and schip premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints 
changes to medicaid and schip programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under those programs 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid and schip 
we believe that reductions in medicaid and schip payments could substantially reduce our profitability 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 
if our medicaid and schip contracts are terminated or are not renewed  our business will suffer 
we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs  including medicaid  ssi and schip 
we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate 
the contracts expire on various dates between april  and december  our contracts may be terminated if we fail to perform up to the standards set by state regulatory agencies 
in addition  the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause 
our contracts are generally intended to run for two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its contractor elects to do so 
when our contracts expire  they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers 
there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended 
if any of our contracts are terminated  not renewed  or renewed on less favorable terms  our business will suffer  and our operating results may be materially affected 
changes in government regulations designed to protect providers and members rather than our stockholders could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 
our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government 
the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect health plan providers and members rather than stockholders 
changes in existing laws and rules  the enactment of new laws and rules or changing interpretations of these laws and rules could  among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network  require us to implement additional or different programs and systems  mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premiums revenues  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  
table of contents require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers  increase our healthcare and administrative costs  impose additional capital and reserve requirements  and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 
for example  congress has considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the patients bill of rights and patient protection legislation is currently pending in congress 
we cannot predict the impact of this legislation  if adopted  on our business 
regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 
our texas plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels 
similarly  our new jersey plan is required to pay a rebate to the state in the event its health benefits ratio is less than 
these regulatory requirements  changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues 
the states of texas  indiana and new jersey have implemented prompt payment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner 
failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties 
in addition  states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low 
any of these regulatory actions could harm our operating results 
also  on january   cms published a final rule that removed a provision contained in the federal medicaid reimbursement regulations permitting states to reimburse non state government owned or operated hospitals for inpatient and outpatient hospital services at amounts up to of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for the services furnished by these hospitals under medicaid payment principles 
the upper payment limit was reduced to of medicare payments for comparable services 
this development in federal regulation decreased the profitability of our health plans 
failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 
federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients privacy and access to healthcare 
violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  the cancellation of our contracts to provide services  the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid  ssi and schip programs 
if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions  or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers  it would negatively impact our ability to operate our business 
for example  failure to pay our providers promptly could result in the imposition of fines and other penalties 
in some states  we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority  which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies 
hipaa created civil penalties for  among other things  billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse 
further  hipaa imposes civil and  in some instances  criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy  security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information 
it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa  which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 
compliance with new government regulations may require us to make significant expenditures 
on august   the united states department of health and human services  or hhs  issued a new regulation under hipaa requiring the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for 
table of contents healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
we were originally required to comply with this regulation by october  on july   cms issued guidance allowing covered entities to implement contingency plans and accept legacy transaction formats if they were not able to meet the october th  compliance date 
the objective of the guidance was to ensure the smooth flow of payments within the health care industry 
many of the states that we operate in implemented contingency plans  which resulted in staggered compliance dates for the organization from october  to april  in december  hhs issued a new regulation mandating heightened privacy and confidentiality protections under hipaa that became effective on april  and for which compliance was required by april  we have begun to integrate gpa into our privacy program 
gpa s privacy policies and procedures are being updated to align with our policies and procedures and all gpa employees are receiving job specific education and training on our privacy practices 
full integration of our privacy program at gpa is expected by the second quarter of on february  hhs published the final hipaa health data security regulations 
the security regulations became effective on april  compliance with the security regulations is required by april  these regulations will require covered entities to implement administrative  physical and technical safeguards to protect electronic health information maintained or transmitted by the organization 
the issuance of future judicial or regulatory guidance regarding the interpretation of regulations  the states ability to promulgate stricter rules  and continuing uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations implementation may make compliance with the relatively new regulatory landscape difficult 
for example  our existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with the new security regulations 
in order to comply with the regulatory requirements  we will be required to employ additional or different programs and systems  the costs of which were  in and are not expected to exceed  in further  compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations 
the new regulations and the related compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes in healthcare law may reduce our profitability 
numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced  some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time 
we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business 
for example  these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for medicaid and reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services 
more generally  we are unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare 
legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation  provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 
changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 
in february  the bush administration proposed a major long term change in the way medicaid and schip are funded 
the proposal  if adopted  would allow states to elect to receive combined medicaid schip allotments for acute and long term health care for low income  uninsured persons 
participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs  subject to federally mandated minimum coverage requirements 
it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted  or if so  how it may change from the initial proposal 
accordingly  it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs 
if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons 
table of contents enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services provided  our growth  operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to participate in schip programs  our growth rate may be limited 
schip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for low income children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs 
the programs vary significantly from state to state 
participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy 
if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate  our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us  we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 
we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries 
if funds normally available to us become limited in the future  we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations 
these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries request to pay dividends to us  the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
risks related to our business receipt of inadequate premiums would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
nearly all of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these premiums are fixed by contract  and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments 
we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our customers 
if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise  our earnings will be affected negatively 
in addition  our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates  which would cause our health benefits ratio  or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues  to increase and our profits to decline 
in addition  it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us 
if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate  our profitability would be harmed 
failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs would reduce our profitability 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits 
we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses 
historically  our health benefits ratio has fluctuated 
for example  our health benefits ratio was for the year ended december   for  for and for  but was for and for because of the narrow margins of our health plan business  relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in healthcare regulations and practices  the level of use of healthcare services  hospital costs  pharmaceutical costs  major epidemics  new medical technologies and other external factors  including general economic conditions such as inflation levels  are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits 
we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future 
if our costs related to health benefits increase  our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 
failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results 
our medical expenses include estimates of ibnr medical expenses 
we estimate our ibnr medical expenses monthly based on a number of factors 
adjustments  if necessary  are made to medical expenses 
table of contents in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change 
we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results of operations 
from time to time in the past  our actual results have varied from our estimates  particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members 
our failure to estimate ibnr accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  further harming our results 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 
historically  the acquisition of medicaid businesses  contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth 
for example  our acquisition of of the equity of uhp on december   accounted for of the increase in our membership for the year ended december  compared to many of the other potential purchasers of medicaid assets have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  many of the sellers are interested either in a selling  along with their medicaid assets  other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies  including their liabilities  as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 
we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner  or at all 
in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition  state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control  including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by not for profit entities 
furthermore  our credit facility may prohibit some acquisitions without the consent of our bank lender 
in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions  we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations 
this may include the integration of additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture  existing provider networks  that may operate on different terms than our existing networks  existing members  who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan  and disparate administrative  accounting and finance  and information systems 
accordingly  we may be unable to identify  consummate and integrate future acquisitions successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably 
we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions 
if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy  our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 
if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us  we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 
we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement 
in  for example  we acquired gpa  a behavioral health services company  and purchased contract and name rights of scriptassist  a medication compliance company 
in order to diversify our business  we must succeed in selling the services of gpa  scriptassist and any other specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans  but to programs operated by third parties 
some of these third party programs may compete with us in some markets  and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from 
table of contents us 
in any event  the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs 
our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 
failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 
start up costs associated with a new business can be substantial 
for example  in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions  we must first establish a provider network  have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims 
if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license  winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs  any new business of ours would fail 
we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover start up costs 
the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 
we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in five states  and our operating results would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 
operations in wisconsin  texas  indiana  new jersey and ohio account for a majority of our premium revenues 
if we were unable to continue to operate in each of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed  our revenues would decrease materially 
our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly  depending on legislative actions  economic conditions and similar factors in those states 
our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 
competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network  benefits provided and quality of service 
we compete with numerous types of competitors  including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided 
subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications  the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs 
voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 
some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry  as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical  medical device and health information systems businesses 
to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve  our ability to retain or increase members and providers  or maintain or increase our revenue growth  pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 
in addition  in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve  we believe that we must continue to develop and implement community specific products  alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs 
if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives  or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so  we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our provider networks  our profitability will be harmed 
our profitability depends  in large part  upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers 
our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians  
table of contents specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon to days prior written notice 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 
from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us 
even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers  it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully 
in addition  we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures  and we may be subject to similar claims 
regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit  they will still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 
we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our profitability will be harmed 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 
we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business 
if we lose one or more members of our senior management team  including our chief executive officer  michael f 
neidorff  who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
neidorff  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain his services 
our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate these personnel 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and operating results 
recently  the managed care industry has received negative publicity 
this publicity has led to increased legislation  regulation  review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services  require us to change our services  and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 
any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results 
claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 
our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims 
in addition  some states  including texas  have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
therefore  successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 
even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit  they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 

table of contents loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 
our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims 
in recent years  the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically  and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future 
as a result of the level of these costs  providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas  which may not address the needs of medicaid participants 
we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service 
if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally  we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner  if at all  and our business could be adversely affected 
growth in the number of medicaid eligible persons during economic downturns could cause our operating results and stock prices to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 
less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits 
during such economic downturns  however  state and federal budgets could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs  benefits and rates 
we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events  including acts of terrorism or related military action  on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate 
if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases  our results of operations will suffer 
growth in the number of medicaid eligible persons may be countercyclical  which could cause our operating results to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 
historically  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
conversely  this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve 
therefore  improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease  thereby causing our operating results to suffer  which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 
we intend to expand our medicaid managed care business primarily into markets where medicaid recipients are required to enroll in managed care plans 
we expect to continue to focus our business in states in which medicaid enrollment in managed care is mandatory 
currently  approximately two thirds of the states require health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants in all or a portion of their counties 
the programs are voluntary in other states 
because we concentrate on markets with mandatory enrollment  we expect the geographic expansion of our medicaid managed care segment to be limited to those states 
if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively  our operations could be disrupted 
our operations depend significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status and other information 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems  we could suffer  among other things  from operational disruptions  loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
in addition  our ability to integrate and manage our 
table of contents information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control  including acts of nature  such as earthquakes or fires  or acts of terrorists 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 
we maintain liability insurance  subject to limits and deductibles  for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services 
these claims could be substantial 
we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million  including restricted deposits of million 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months 
the long term investments consist of municipal bonds and us treasury investments and have original maturities greater than one year 
restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies 
these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states requirements 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
we have the ability to hold these short term investments to maturity which would mitigate the risk of a significant increase in market rates 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from healthcare providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases 
compliance costs federal and state regulations governing standards for electronic transactions  data security and confidentiality of patient information have been issued recently 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory requirements  we cannot be sure that the systems and programs that we have implemented will comply adequately with the regulations that are ultimately adopted 
implementation of additional systems and programs will be required  the cost of which we estimate not to exceed  in further  compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states
