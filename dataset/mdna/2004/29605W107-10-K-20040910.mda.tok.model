see recent expansion  above 
revenues the company recorded an increase in total revenues of approximately   to approximately  for the year ended june  from approximately  for the year ended june  revenues from existing operations were  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended june  revenues attributable to expanded operations for the fiscal year ended june  were as follows  from the seven european subsidiaries   from the four us subsidiaries  and  under the exclusive supply contracts with afinsa a related party 
the revenue attributable to transactions under the exclusive supply contracts with afinsa includes the see provided for under the contracts 
the company recognized revenue from sales to afinsa of  in the year ended june  those revenues  however  were not derived from the exclusive supply contracts with afinsa and as such were included in our existing operations last year 
in the above table  these revenues are reported as expanded operations for comparative purposes only 
for the year ended june   the total revenue of approximately  comprised approximately  of revenue from sales of owned inventory and approximately  of commissions resulting from sales of consigned materials 
the variation in any year in the composition of total revenues as between revenues resulting from inventory sales and commissions resulting from consignment sales is largely a function of availability  market demand and conditions 
gross profit increased approximately   to approximately  for the year ended june  from approximately  for the year ended june  the increased gross profit was the result of an increase in revenue of  coupled with an increase in gross profit percentage from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the largest contributing factor to the increase in gross profit percentage was  in direct sales to afinsa a related party in the year ended june  under the exclusive supply contracts part of expanded operations 
exclusive of sales to afinsa  the gross profit percentage increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the increase  exclusive of sales to afinsa  was the result of higher gross profit margins on auction sales of owned stamp inventory  which reflects an improvement in the quality and pricing of stamp purchases by the company  as well as  to a lesser extent  revenue attributable to the operations of the seven european and four us subsidiaries acquired by the company during the year ended june  part of expanded operations  this revenue consisted almost entirely of commissions  with respect to which there is no corresponding cost of goods sold 
the gross profit percentage for sales to afinsa a related party and otherwise will vary depending on market demand  market conditions and buying opportunities relative to each type of product being sold  as well as on the proportion of the revenue mix between sales of merchandise where the gross profit will be less than and commissions earned where there is no cost of goods sold and therefore where the gross profit percentage will be 
operating expenses existing expanded total operations operations operations variance var general administrative      salaries      marketing     depreciation amortization the company s operating expenses increased approximately  during the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  of this increase   was attributable to existing operations   was attributable to the operations of the seven european subsidiaries part of expanded operations and  to the four us subsidiaries part of expanded operations 
with respect to existing operations  general and administrative expenses increased  
the increase was due to the following additional bad debt expense of approximately  relating to the charges for stock options for services to afinsa related party  payments to board members in the amount of  an increase in professional fees in the amount of largely due to the acquisitions that were made during the fiscal year as well as additional costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase in shareholder s expenses of  increased insurance costs of  and expenditures relating to the relocation of a subsidiary s operations from new york to california  including overlapping expenses and additional travel costs

increased costs for the year ended june  were offset by revenue increases during the period  holding operating costs as a percentage of operating revenue at for the fiscal year ended june   the same percentage as in the fiscal year ended june  as compared to aggregate sales  the operating costs remained at for both fiscal years ended june  and interest income and expense interest expense net of interest income for the year ended june  decreased approximately from the fiscal year ended june   from approximately to approximately the decrease in net interest expense was due to increased funding of operations by profits  cash from sale of common stock to afinsa related party and the attaining of financing at lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rates for the years ended june  and were approximately and  respectively 
the rate is based on a blended rate consisting of us federal  state and foreign statutory income tax rates 
the rates have been reduced by the utilization of a large percentage of the available net operating loss carry forwards for u 
s federal income tax purposes 
future blended tax rates should be higher based on the reduced remaining net operating loss carry forwards 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are also subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate can also be influenced by the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and non recurring charges  which may cause fluctuations between reporting periods 
the realization of the company s remaining deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future to offset the deductibility of temporary differences generating the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize certain deferred tax assets 
the company reduced its valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets which were provided for in prior years 
as a result the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately  there was no net deferred tax expense benefit for recent new jersey tax legislation will provide for the utilization of a portion of net operating losses for fiscal year and thereafter 
net income loss the company s increase in gross profit of approximately  for the year ended june  was offset by an increase in operating expenses of  a impairment of an investment in gmai asia and income tax expense of  offset by a gain of  from the sale of investee related party in the third quarter of fiscal  there was a net gain of approximately  for the year ended june  from the year ended june  results of operations years ended june  and dollars in thousands except as noted or per share information revenues for the year ended june   operating revenues increased by approximately   to approximately  for the year ended june  from approximately  for the year ended june  this increase is almost exclusively attributable to an increase in sales of owned inventory of approximately   resulting from sales of coins of approximately  an increase from the prior year  as well as an increase in stamp revenue of approximately  the increase in stamp sales was due to increased sales to afinsa a related party  in the amount of  the combined gains from coin and stamps were reduced by  due to the sale of the comic and movie poster division in september for the year ended june   operating revenues contained comic book sales and auctions of  also there was a decrease of due to a softening of the sports market 
gross profit increased to approximately  for the year ended june  from approximately  for the year ended june  this represents an increase of approximately  
a significant amount of the increased gross profit was derived from direct sales of two large specialty collections to afinsa a related party in the fourth quarter 
additional gross profit from higher coin sales was approximately gross profit percentage increased to for fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the largest contributing factor to the increase in gross profit percentage was  in direct sales of two large specialty collections to afinsa a related party in the fourth quarter 
exclusive of sales to afinsa  the gross profit percentage for fiscal would have been as compared to for fiscal the increase was the result of higher gross profit margins on auction sales of owned stamp inventory  which reflects an improvement in the quality and pricing of stamp purchases by the company 
operating expenses the decrease in total operating expenses  in combination with the revenue increases had the effect of decreasing total operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue to in the year ended june  from during the year ended june  the company recorded expenses relating to bad debt of and for and  respectively 
over the past five years the average ratio of bad debt to aggregate sales was less than 
the company s aggregate operating expenses  exclusive of cost of merchandise sold  for the year ended june  was approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended june   representing a decrease of approximately  
included in the operating loss for the year ended june  are expenses relating to intangible impairments of  as compared to in the year ended june  the intangible impairment charges were based on future discounted cash flows as further described in the company s critical accounting policies 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended june  exclusive of intangible impairments decreased from approximately  in the year ended june  to approximately in the year ended june  depreciation decreased and amortization in the year ended june  the reduction of amortization expense is the result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no as of july  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
the test conducted for year ended june  resulted in no impairments 
g a expenses decreased approximately in year ended june  when compared to in large part due to charges of of service fees for greg manning direct in the year ended june  with in the year ended june  salaries increased in the year ended june  due in part to an increase in personnel to handle the increase in coin and stamp inventory and corresponding sales but also in the form of bonuses both contractual   and discretionary  interest income and expense interest expense for the year ended june  increased approximately to approximately  largely due to financing for specific inventory purchases with the seller 
interest income increased during the year ended june  by approximately 
the interest income in the year ended june  was lower due to the write off of finance charges  which were deemed uncollectible 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate for the year ended june  and were approximately and  respectively 
the difference relates to a state tax expense for as compared to an increase in the valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax asset attributes in this rate may change in future periods if operating results or acquisition related costs differ significantly from current projections 
during  both the state of new jersey and california passed tax legislation  which  among other things  requires the suspension of the use of state net operating loss carry forwards for two years 
as a result  there is provision for state income taxes for the year ended june  in order to compensate for the suspension of the state net operating losses  the period of availability has been extended by two years 
net income loss the company recorded net income for the year ended june  of approximately  compared to a loss of approximately  for the year ended june   an increase of approximately  during this period 
the increase in gross profit of approximately  a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense  including intangible impairment of approximately  the gain on sale of an equity method investee of  to afinsa a related party and a reduction in tax expense of  comprised the change in net income for the fiscal ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  the tax expense of  in the fiscal year ended june  was the result of an increase in the valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax asset attributes in european monetary union the european monetary unit the euro was introduced on january  as a wholesale currency 
the eleven participating european monetary union member countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the euro 
the currencies that existed january  continued to be used as legal tender through january   on july   the existing currencies were cancelled and euro bills and coins are currently being used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangement that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at june   the company s working capital position was approximately  compared to approximately  as of june  the net increase of approximately  was primarily due to the three transactions with auctentia that were consummated during the fiscal year see recent expansion  above 
the acquisition was an exchange of  in equity for but not limited to current assets of  in cash and  in inventory 
other major increases to working capital were gains due to an increase in accounts receivable of both auctions and trade and related party of  and an increase in inventory of  the company also reduced its valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and recorded a current deferred tax asset of approximately  the major uses of working capital were an increase in accounts payable of  for the purchase of inventory   for an increase in advances payable related party  an increase in consignor payables of  and an increase in income taxes payable of  operating activities the company experienced a positive cash flow from operating activities of approximately  for the year ended june  as compared to a negative cash flow of approximately  for  a net increase of approximately  inventory purchases resulted in a decrease in cash flow of  in and  in the large increase in was due to the purchases of large collections to fill the requirements of the exclusive supplier agreement with afinsa related party as well as the upcoming philatelic auctions 
the philatelic auctions have progressively been composed of more owned inventory as opposed to consignments and the overall size of the auctions have increased thus the larger inventory 
accounts receivable related party also resulted in a decrease in cash flow of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  resulting in a net decrease of  from fiscal to fiscal the increase in accounts receivable related party is the result of the exclusive supply agreements between the company and afinsa a related party 
additionally  as a result of increased advances to consignors resulting from the company s recent expansion  there was a decrease in cash flow in the amount of  increases in cash flow were primarily attributable to taxes payable of  accounts payable of  and payables to third party consignors in the amount of  the increase in payables to third party consignors was primarily attributable to philatelic auctions held in may by the company s european subsidiaries kohler auktionen and corinphilia 
overall there was a positive net change in cash and cash equivalents in of  the company experienced a negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to a negative cash flow of approximately for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of approximately inventory purchases resulted in a decrease in cash flow of  in fiscal from a positive cash flow of  in fiscal the large difference was due to the purchase of large collections in the fourth quarter of fiscal of both coins and philatelics 
accordingly  because of the inventory purchases there was a positive cash flow of  in fiscal from accounts payable as compared to a negative cash flow of in fiscal or a net change of  overall there was a positive change in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal of investing activities the company experienced a decrease in cash flow from investing activities for the year ended june  of approximately of  this was the result of purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets due to acquisitions in the amount of  see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements and the purchases of property and equipment in the amount of  which was also almost exclusively related to expanded operations 
the company had negative cash flow from investing activities of approximately for the year ended june   which was mainly comprised of payments for capital expenditures of and a loan to a related party in the amount of financing activities in the fiscal year ended june  the company had a positive cash flow of  from financing activities  a net gain of  from the gain of  for the fiscal year ended june  increases in cash flow were from proceeds from the exercise of options of  proceeds from issuance of stock of  and  from demand notes payable 
on september  the company exchanged stock for cash  in one of the three transactions with auctentia see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
borrowings under line of credit agreement with pnc bank see credit and financing facilities  below were  as of june  our future cash flows from the exercise of stock options are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of both our stock price and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options 
in general  we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased 
the company had positive cash flow from financing activities of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  during  the company had additional borrowings of from demand notes payable related party 
the company also established a new line of credit with banco santander hispano  sa  on april  with borrowings of  these increases were offset by the repayment of  relating to notes payable and capital leases 
additionally there was an increase in cash from the exercise of options of under an agreement dated march   gmai sold all of its then outstanding interest in gmai asia to afinsa for  consisting of  shares of gmai asia 
com common stock 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repay all amounts then outstanding under gmai s revolving line of credit with afinsa 
credit and financing facilities the company s credit and financing facilities  which are included in the above discussion  consist of the following on may   the company entered into an agreement with pnc bank for a line of credit not to exceed  the loan is collaterized by accounts receivable  consignor advances and inventory  subject to certain limitations 
borrowings under the line bear interest at the prime rate  provided that the company has the right  subject to certain conditions  to borrow at a rate equal to libor plus per annum 
the credit line expires on may  the agreement contains other financial agreements and covenants 
at june   the company had borrowed  under the facility 
on april   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with banco santander central hispano  sa  providing for a credit facility of up to  borrowings under this facility bear interest at a rate of prime plus 
per annum 
the company s obligations under the agreement have been guaranteed by afinsa 
the agreement contains other financial agreements and covenants  including the requirement that auctentia maintain at least of all of the authorized issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of the company 
as extended  the facility expires on april  at june  and june  gmai had borrowed  under this facility 
during the year ended june   the company obtained a secured loan from a privately held capital fund in the amount of  as of june  the loan is collateralized by inventory and bears interest at the rate of per annum 
the loan is due on june  the remaining notes payable consist of capital leases and loans payable for the purchase of equipment bearing interest at rates ranging from to 
total borrowings outstanding under the leases were and as of june  and  respectively 
as of june   the company had an aggregate of  of debt outstanding under the above credit and financing facilities 
need for future liquidity the company s need for liquidity and working capital may increase as a result of its continuing business expansion activities 
in addition to the need for such capital to enhance the company s ability to offer cash advances to a larger number of potential consignors of property which is an important aspect of the marketing of an auction business  the company may require additional working capital in the future in order to acquire collectibles for sale in the company s business  to expand into sales of other collectibles and to initiate any other new business activities 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations related to non cancelable operating and capital leases at june  were as follows payment due by period less than more than total year years years years demand notes   long term debt capital lease and other debt obligations operating lease obligations   total    auction cycles a buyer of auctioned property may be permitted to take possession of the property before payment is made 
most accounts receivable are collected within to days  which is consistent with business practice in the collectible markets 
for the years ended june  and the company s expense relating to bad debt was approximately  and respectively 
for the years ended june  and the company s history of bad debts has been less than of revenue 
because of the nature of the auction business of the company  there is a relationship between accounts receivable  advances to consignors  and payable to consignors 
depending upon the relationship of the balance sheet date to a given auction sale date and a settlement date for a given auction  these balances could change substantially from one balance sheet date to another 
in the cycle of any single auction  the effect on the balance sheet and on the company s cash flows is significant when compared to the total assets of the company 
the cycle for a single auction begins with consignors contracting with the company to sell their property at auction 
typically these contracts are signed from to weeks in advance of the auction sale date 
no entry is made on the balance sheet of the company when the company receives the property for auction or when a contract for the consignment to the auction is signed 
since the contract for the sale of the property is for services not yet rendered  there is no financial statement impact 
at the time of the consignment  or any time thereafter until the auction sale date  the consignor may request a cash advance which is a prepaid portion of the prices to be realized of the property irrevocably committed to be sold in the auction 
the cash advance takes the form of a self liquidating  secured loan to the consignor  using the property consigned as collateral 
cash advances to consignors are often used as a marketing tool in order to obtain property for a sale 
when the cash advance is made  there is an increase of the accounts of the company in cash advances to consignors  and simultaneously  there is a corresponding decrease in cash 
approximately weeks after the auction date  often referred to as the settlement date  the payables to consignors decrease to zero as all the consignors are paid and the company withholds a portion of the amounts due the consignor for the sale of the property as an offset to repay the principal amount and the accrued interest on the cash advances to consignors or loans to consignors  and there is a decrease in cash  corresponding to the net amount paid to the consignors 
the entire cycle for a single auction typically is about to weeks in duration 
because of the high level of activity in the company  single auction cycles do not occur in series  with the next cycle beginning immediately after the previous cycle ends 
rather  single auction cycles occur in parallel 
for example  when a certain cycle ends  a second cycle may be at the midpoint  while yet a third cycle is just beginning 
depending upon the relative values of the property consigned to each sale in the three cycles in this example  and depending upon the demand for auction advances in each of the cycles  the cumulative effect on the balance sheet  and particularly the current assets and current liabilities and the company s cash flows  is very significant 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company has not been significant during the last three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which the company relies are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following o revenue recognition o allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns o inventory valuation and classification o goodwill and intangible assets o accounting for income taxes in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues from two primary sources private treaty sales private treaty sales represent sales of consigned property and sales of owned inventory which includes sales to afinsa related party pursuant to the exclusive supplier agreement as further described in item description of business and recent expansion 
private treaty sales of consigned property occur when an owner of property arranges with the company to sell such consigned property to a third party at a privately negotiated price 
in such a transaction  the owner may set selling price parameters for the company  or the company may solicit selling prices for the owner  and the owner may reserve the right to reject any selling price 
the company does not guarantee a fixed price to the owner  which would be payable regardless of the actual sales price ultimately received 
the company recognizes as private treaty revenue an amount equal to a percentage of the sales price 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a net basis as commission revenue and are recognized when sold 
private treaty sales of owned inventory occur when the company sells its goods directly to a customer either wholesale or retail 
revenue with respect to private treaty revenues is recognized when delivered or released to the customer for acceptance or to a common carrier for delivery 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a gross basis as sales of merchandise 
sales returns have not been material 
auction revenue revenue is recognized when collectibles are sold at auction and is represented by an auction commission received from the buyer and seller 
auction commissions represent a percentage of the hammer price at auction sales as paid by the buyer and the seller 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a net basis as commission revenue 
the company also sells its own inventory at auction 
revenue of owned inventory is recognized when sold at auction 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a gross basis as sales of merchandise 
additionally  the company is entitled to auction commissions paid by the buyer 
sales returns have not been material 
the company does not provide any guarantee with respect to the authenticity of property offered for sale at auction 
each lot is sold as genuine and as described by the company in the catalogue 
when however  in the opinion of a competent authority mutually acceptable to the company and the purchaser  a lot is declared otherwise  the purchase price will be refunded in full if the lot is returned to the company within a specified period 
in such event  the company will return such lot to the consignor before a settlement payment has been made to such consignor for the lot in question 
to date  returns have not been material 
large collections are generally sold on an as is basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company makes judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding auction and consignor advances receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
the company continuously monitors payments from its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the period they become known 
the company frequently extends trade credit in connection with its auction sales  which are held throughout the united states 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis  generally the customers who receive trade credit are professional dealers who have regularly purchased property at the company s auctions or whose reputation within the industry is known and respected by the company 
in situations where trade credit is extended  the purchaser generally takes possession of the property before payment is made by the purchaser to the company  and the company is liable to the consignor for the net sales proceeds auction hammer price less commission to the company 
the company pays the consignor generally no later than the th day after the sale  and when trade credit is extended  the company assumes all risk of loss associated with the trade credit  and the responsibility of collection of the trade credit amount from the purchaser 
losses to date under these situations have not been material 
certain sales of inventory owned by the company are made with extended payment terms up to twelve months 
certain assets held by the company collateralize these receivables 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
in recording any additional allowances  a respective charge against income is reflected in the general and administrative expenses  and would reduce our operating results in the period in which the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation and classification inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm  which reflects management s estimates of net realizable value 
inventories are accounted for under the specific identification method 
in instances where bulk purchases are made  the cost allocation is based on the estimated market values of the respective goods 
the company periodically reviews the age and turnover of its inventory to determine whether any inventory has declined in value and incurs a charge to operations for such declines 
the company records write downs based on two methodologies  specific write downs on certain items based on declines in the marketplace  and estimated write downs based on a percentage of the inventory aging by category type  unless the company implores a marketing strategy to sell goods over time 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
increases in write downs and adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified and a resulting charge to cost of merchandise sold is recorded which would reduce our operating results in the period in which the increase is recorded 
in certain instances  the company holds inventory for a period of time in excess of one year  which is generally based on a marketing strategy to sell collectibles over time in order to avoid flooding the marketplace 
inventories  which are not expected to be sold within one year  are classified with other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets goodwill goodwill primarily includes the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired 
effective july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and tests its goodwill on an annual basis using a two step fair value based test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
management has determined that it operates as one reporting unit and therefore assesses goodwill for impairment on an enterprise wide basis 
management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using the company s market capitalization  which determines if the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
if impairment is determined  the company will recognize additional charges to operating expenses in the period in which they are identified  which would result in a reduction of operating results and a reduction in the amount of goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas on july   the company amortized goodwill over its estimated useful life and evaluated goodwill for impairment in conjunction with its other long lived assets 
other intangible assets other purchased intangibles consisting of trademarks and customer lists  purchased as part of business acquisitions are presented net of related accumulated amortization and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining useful lives 
the company records impairment losses on other intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired and the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its recorded amount in accordance with sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews the value of its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include material adverse changes in operations  significant adverse differences in actual results in comparison with initial valuation forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition  a decision to abandon certain acquired products  services or marketplaces  or other significant adverse changes that would indicate the carrying amount of the recorded asset might not be recoverable 
annually  the company performs this analysis with assistance from an independent valuation expert 
the company evaluates the recoverability of other purchased intangibles using undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing these analyses uses the best information available in the circumstances including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax expense provision 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered 
the company assesses the likelihood of our deferred tax assets being recovered from future taxable income 
the company then provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which the company does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased in the future to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any change in the valuation allowance could have a material impact on net income in the period in which such determination is made 
new accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by the company  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on behalf of the company  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company o although the company s results of operations for the years ended june  and reflect a significant improvement over the results of prior periods  a significant portion of the gross profit for those periods was attributable to sales to afinsa a related party 
a decrease in the level of sales to afinsa  or the termination of the supply agreements with afinsa see recent expansion  above could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there is no minimum level of sales provided for under the supply agreements with afinsa  and the agreements may be terminated upon six month s notice by either party 
o the company s debt agreements expire at various times during the next twelve months 
the company has previously been able to refinance or renegotiate these agreements in the past 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accomplish this in the future 
o at times there may be a limited supply of collectibles available for sale by the company 
such supply historically has varied from time to time 
while the company has not generally experienced a lack of collectibles that has prevented it from conducting appropriately sized auctions on an acceptable schedule  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain consignments of suitable quantities of collectibles in order to conduct auctions of the size  and at the times  the company may desire in the future 
the inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  the popularity of collectibles could decline 
this could affect the market value of inventory that gmai currently holds  including the inventory acquired under the inventory purchase agreement  or inventory it or its subsidiaries may acquire in the future 
o the business of selling stamps  coins  and other collectibles at auction and in retail sales is highly competitive 
the company competes with a number of auction houses and collectibles companies throughout the north america  europe and the rest of the world 
while the company believes that there is no dominant company in the stamp auction or collectibles business in which it operates  there can be no assurances that other companies with greater financial and other resources and name recognition will not enter the market 
among the primary competitors in the philatelic auction business in north america and europe are matthew bennett  inc  charles shreve galleries  inc  robert a 
siegel  harmers of london  thomas hoiland auktioner a s  postiljonen ab  david feldman  sa sa  edgar mohrmann co  bolaffi  rapp auktionshaus 
with respect to sports trading card and sports memorabilia auction business  the primary competitors are lelands  mastro auctions and sotheby s 
with respect to coin operations  the main competitors are heritage and stacks 
with respect to internet operations  the market for internet products and services is highly competitive and there are no substantial barriers to entry 
the company expects that competition will continue to intensify 
many of the company s internet competitors have more experience than the company has maintaining internet operations and have greater brand recognition 
o auctentia and afinsa currently beneficially own approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
this represents a substantial dilution in the current voting power of non auctentia related stockholders of the company 
as a result  auctentia and its affiliates will be able to elect the entire board of directors of gmai 
auctentia and its affiliates also may be able to approve other actions as a stockholder without obtaining the votes of other stockholders of the company or impede transactions that may be desirable for other stockholders 
in addition  this concentration of ownership  which is not subject to any voting restrictions  could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for the company s common stock 
o the company and auctentia have signed a registration rights agreement pursuant to which auctentia may request that  shares of the company s common stock beneficially owned by it including  warrants to purchase gmai common stock be registered by the company at the company s expense 
auctentia has agreed that the  shares of the company s stock it received pursuant to the share purchase agreement will not be sold or otherwise transferred prior to march all other registerable company common stock owned by auctentia will be freely tradable immediately after any registration 
o the transactions contemplated by the share purchase agreement have presented challenges to management  including the integration of the operations  product lines  technologies and personnel of the company and the european subsidiaries  and special risks  including possible unanticipated liabilities  unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the combined businesses will achieve increased sales levels  profitability  efficiencies or synergies or that the transactions contemplated by the share purchase agreement will result in increased earnings for the combined companies in any future period 
the difficulties of combining the operations of gmai and the european subsidiaries are complicated by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
o the company s future success depends to a significant extent on its retaining services of senior management and other key personnel  particularly gmai s president and chief executive officer  greg manning  and the president of spectrum numismatics international  inc  greg roberts 
gmai s business would be adversely affected if for any reason it failed to retain the services of messrs 
manning or roberts and failed to engage suitable replacements 
o gmai s operations may be adversely affected by governmental regulation and taxation of the internet  which is subject to change 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations may result in enactment of laws concerning various aspects of the internet  including online content  user privacy  access charges  liability for third party activities and jurisdictional issues 
these laws could harm the company s business by increasing its cost of doing business or discouraging use of the internet 
the internet freedom tax act expired in november federal legislation which would extend the act is currently pending 
o the company s business will be adversely affected if use of the internet by consumers  particularly purchasers of collectibles  does not continue to grow 
a number of factors may inhibit consumers from using the internet 
these include inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service and a lack of cost effective high speed service 
even if internet use grows  the internet s infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  many web sites have experienced service interruptions as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet infrastructure 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  use of the internet  as well as use of our web sites  could grow more slowly or decline 
o some local telephone carriers claim that the increasing popularity of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure and that many areas with high internet use are experiencing interruptions in telephone service 
these carriers have petitioned the us federal communications commission to impose access fees on internet service providers 
if these access fees are imposed  the cost of communicating on the internet could increase  and this could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
o the company holds rights to various web domain names 
governmental agencies typically regulate domain names 
these regulations are subject to change 
gmai may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which it or its affiliates do business 
furthermore  regulations governing domain names may not protect the company s trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
the company may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or diminish the value of its trademarks and other proprietary rights 
o due to difficulty anticipating levels or values of consignments at any given time  the stamp auction business is susceptible to significant fluctuations in operating results and revenue shortfalls  which could adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  the company s operating results in the coin business are dependent upon product availability over the short and long term  which cannot be predicted with any certainty 
future fluctuations in operating results or revenue shortfalls of the company could adversely affect the success of the company 
if revenue fails to offset operating expenses in the future  the company may be required to fund future operations through the sale of additional common stock  which could cause the market price of its stock to decline  as well as have a dilutive effect on the value of its common stock currently outstanding 
o the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  some of which may be beyond the company s control  including sales of the company s common stock by stockholders  actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s operating results  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  developments and publicity regarding the company s industry  and general economic conditions 
o in addition  the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock  regardless of the company s actual performance  and could enhance the effect of any fluctuations that do relate to its operating results 
o the company may be adversely affected by the costs and other effects associated with i legal and administrative cases and proceedings  ii settlements  investigations  claims and changes in those items  and iii adoption of new  or changes in  accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices 
o the company s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  and the american institute of certified public accountant o our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are also subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate can also be influenced by the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and non recurring charges  which may cause fluctuations between reporting periods 
this list should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe that it is exposed to significant market risk through interest rate risks  foreign currency exchange risks  commodity price risks or other similar market risks 
the company s interest rates are generally market based 
in addition  because its business is operated primarily in the united states of america  its transactions are executed in us dollars 
the company will assess the significance of interest rate  exchange rate and other market risk on a periodic basis and will implement strategies to manage risk as appropriate
