item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general corporate history we were incorporated in delaware in september for the purpose of acquiring generex pharmaceuticals  inc  a canadian corporation formed in november to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and other activities 
our acquisition of generex pharmaceuticals was completed in october in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of generex pharmaceuticals exchanged their shares for shares of our common stock 
in january  we participated in a reverse acquisition with green mt 
p 
s  inc  a previously inactive idaho corporation formed in as a result of this transaction  our stockholders the former shareholders of generex pharmaceuticals acquired a majority approximately of the outstanding capital stock of green mt  we became a wholly owned subsidiary of green mt  green mt 
changed its corporate name to generex biotechnology corporation generex idaho  and we changed our corporate name to gbc delaware  inc because the reverse acquisition resulted in our stockholders becoming the majority holders of generex idaho  we were treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes 
thus  our historical financial statements  which essentially represented the historical financial statements of generex pharmaceuticals  were deemed to be the historical financial statements of generex idaho 
in april  we completed a reorganization in which we merged with generex idaho 
in this transaction  all outstanding shares of generex idaho were converted into our shares  generex idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity  and we changed our corporate name back to generex biotechnology corporation 
this reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting 
in august   we acquired antigen express  inc antigen pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement 
antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
for details about this acquisition  see business history 
business history we are primarily engaged in the development of proprietary drug delivery technology 
our principal business focus has been to develop a technology for buccal delivery absorption through the inner cheek walls of large molecule drugs  ie  drugs composed of molecules with molecular weights above a specified level 
large molecule drugs historically have been administered only by injection because their size inhibits or precludes absorption if administered by oral  transdermal  transnasal or other means 
our first product is an insulin formulation that is administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using a hand held aerosol spray applicator 
between january and september  we conducted limited clinical trials on this product in the united states  canada and europe 
in september  we entered into an agreement the development and license agreement to develop this product with eli lilly and company lilly 
to date  over patients with diabetes have been dosed with our oral insulin product at approved facilities in seven countries 
we have conducted several clinical trials with insulin supplied by lilly under our agreement 
lilly did not  however  authorize or conduct any clinical trials or provide financial support for those trials 
we did receive a  up front payment from lilly 
on may   we announced that we had agreed with lilly to end the development and license agreement for the development and commercialization of buccal delivery of insulin 
on november   we entered into a termination agreement with lilly terminating the development and license agreement  effective as of june  we will retain all of the intellectual property and commercialization rights with respect to buccal spray drug delivery technology  and we will have the continuing right to develop and commercialize the product 
we also entered into a bulk supply agreement the bulk supply agreement for the sale of human insulin crystals by lilly to us over a three year period 
the bulk supply agreement establishes purchase prices  minimum purchase requirements  maximum amounts which may be purchased in each year and a non refundable prepayment of  to be applied against amounts due for purchases 
in january  we established a joint venture with elan international services  ltd 
eis  a wholly owned subsidiary of elan corporation  plc eis and elan corporation  plc being collectively referred to as elan  to pursue the application of certain of our and elan s drug delivery technologies  including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products  for the treatment of prostate cancer  endometriosis and or the suppression of testosterone and estrogen 
in january  we and elan agreed to expand the joint venture to encompass the buccal delivery of morphine for the treatment of pain and agreed to pursue buccal morphine as the initial pharmaceutical product for development under generex bermuda ltd  the entity through which the joint venture is being conducted 
this expansion of the joint venture occurred after we successfully completed a proof of concept clinical study of morphine delivery using our proprietary buccal delivery technology 
in connection with the joint venture  eis purchased  shares of a new series of our preferred stock  designated as series a preferred stock  for  we applied the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock to subscribe for an equity ownership interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
eis paid in capital of  to subscribe for a equity ownership interest in the joint venture entity 
subsequent to its purchase of the shares of series a preferred stock  eis transferred the shares to an affiliate of elan 
while we presently own of the joint venture entity  the elan affiliate has the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase its ownership up to by exchanging the series a preferred stock for of our equity ownership of the joint venture entity 
alternatively  the series a preferred stock may be converted  under certain conditions  into shares of our common stock 
in accordance with the terms of the series a preferred stock  if any shares of series a preferred stock are outstanding on january   we are required to redeem the shares of series a preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the aggregate series a preferred stock liquidation preference which currently equals the aggregate original purchase price of the series a preferred stock  either in cash  or in shares of common stock with a fair market value equal to the redemption price 
in january  and  pursuant to the terms of the agreement with eis  the elan affiliate received a stock dividend of series a preferred stock 
eis also purchased  shares of our common stock for  we were permitted to use the proceeds of this sale for any corporate purpose 
if the joint venture achieves certain milestones  we may require eis to purchase an additional  of our common stock at a premium to the then prevailing fair market value of our common stock 
generex bermuda  ltd 
was granted non exclusive licenses to utilize our buccal delivery technology and certain elan drug delivery technologies 
using the funds from its initial capitalization  generex bermuda  ltd 
paid a non refundable license fee of  to elan in consideration for being granted the rights to utilize the elan drug delivery technologies 
to date we have not received any substantial economic support from elan in connection with the joint venture or the development of the morphine product  other than its initial capital contribution 
however  we have continued to conduct research and development activities with the morphine product 
our new subsidiary antigen is engaged in research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
our immunomedicine products work by stimulating the immune system to either attack offending agents ie  cancer cells  bacteria  and viruses or to stop attacking benign elements ie  self proteins and allergens 
our immunomedicine products are based on two platform technologies that were discovered by an executive officer of antigen  the ii key hybrid peptides and ii suppression 
the immunomedicine products are in the pre clinical stage of development  and trials in human patients are not expected for at least months 
development efforts are underway in melanoma  breast cancer  prostate cancer  hiv  sars vaccine and type i diabetes 
we are establishing collaborations with academic centers to advance the technology  with the ultimate goal of conducting human clinical testing 
we do not expect to receive any revenues from product sales in the current fiscal year 
however  we have received and we expect to continue to receive some revenue from research grants for antigen s immunomedicine products 
to date  we have received a total of  in such research grants 
we expect to satisfy all of our cash needs during the current year from capital raised through equity financings 
disclosure regarding research and development projects our major research and development projects are the refinement of our basic buccal delivery technology  our buccal insulin project and our buccal morphine product 
both our insulin product and our morphine product are in clinical trials 
in canada  we have recently begun phase ii b trials for insulin 
in order to obtain fda and canadian hpb approval for any of our product candidates  we will be required to complete phase iii trials which involve testing our product with a large number of patients over a significant period of time 
the conduct of phase iii trials will require significantly greater funds than we either have on hand or have experience in raising in any year or two years time 
we will therefore need to receive funding from a corporate collaborator  or engage in fundraising on a scale with which we have no experience 
because of various uncertainties  we cannot predict the timing of completion of our buccal insulin or buccal morphine products 
these uncertainties include the success of current studies  our ability to obtain the required financing and the time required to obtain regulatory approval even if our research and development efforts are completed and successful 
for the same reasons  we cannot predict when any products may begin to produce net cash inflows 
most of our buccal delivery research and development activities to date have involved developing our platform technology for use with insulin and morphine 
insubstantial amounts have been expended on projects with other drugs  and those projects involved a substantial amount of platform technology development 
therefore  in the past  we have not made significant distinctions in the accounting for research and development expenses among products  as a significant portion of all research has involved improvements to the platform technology in connection with insulin  which may benefit all of our potential products 
during fiscal  approximately of our  research expenses were attributable to insulin and platform technology development  and approximately was attributable to morphine and fentanyl projects 
as morphine and fentanyl are both narcotic painkillers  the research is related 
during fiscal  approximately of our  of research and development was expended for insulin and platform technology  and approximately for morphine and fentanyl 
approximately  or  of our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were related to antigen s immunomedicine products 
because these products are in a very early  pre clinical stage of development  all of the expenses were accounted for as basic research and no distinctions were made as to particular products 
because of the early stage of development  we cannot predict the timing of completion of any products arising from this technology  or when products from this technology might begin producing revenues 
however  we can predict that we do not expect to begin clinical trials during the current fiscal year 
developments in fiscal in august  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of antigen pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement between us  antigen and agexp acquisition  inc agexp  our wholly owned subsidiary that was formed for purposes of the transaction 
pursuant to the merger agreement o agexp merged with and into antigen the merger  o antigen became our wholly owned subsidiary  and o all of the former shareholders of antigen were entitled to receive shares of our common stock in exchange for their shares of antigen capital stock 
antigen has facilities and its headquarters located at worcester  massachusetts 
antigen is engaged in research and development to develop immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
antigen s potential products are based on two platform technologies ii key hybrid peptides and ii suppression discovered by an officer of antigen 
the merger agreement provided for each holder of antigen common stock and each holder of each of the four outstanding series of antigen preferred stock to receive shares of our common stock for each share of antigen common stock or preferred stock held by such holder 
the merger agreement established exchange rates for the conversion of antigen common and the various series of preferred stock into our common stock

restatement subsequent to the issuance of its financial statements for the year ended july   management determined that its series a preferred stock should be reclassified from stockholders equity  in accordance with emerging issues task force topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities  because the redemption feature of the series a preferred stock is beyond our control 
this restatement did not affect net loss for the year ended july   nor did it affect total assets 
the series a preferred stock should have been included outside the statement of stockholders equity from the date of its issuance in january results of operations compared with we had a net loss of  for the year ended july  fiscal compared to a net loss of  in the year ended july  fiscal 
the net loss for fiscal and excludes  and  respectively  in non cash stock dividend on preferred shares 
the increase in our fiscal net loss resulted from an increase in research and development expenses to  from  and an increase in general and administrative expenses to  from  the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal reflects research and development activities of antigen  the increase in activities of regulatory consultants  bulk insulin purchases and an increase in depreciation of the patents due to additional patents acquired in the antigen merger 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflects the increase in consulting services  increased level of participation in industry shows and seminars  travel associated with shows and financing activities  increased insurance and depreciation expenses as well as termination agreements 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in legal and litigation expenses and a reduction in executive compensation 
our interest and miscellaneous income net of interest expense in fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal due to decreases in our cash and short term investments and lower interest rates 
we received higher income from rental operations net of expense of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in both of the last two fiscal years  we incurred substantial expenses for financial advisory and other financing services that were not related to a specific financing and  therefore  were accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses  in fiscal and  in fiscal were paid partially through the issuance of common stock and or warrants and options to purchase common stock 
results of operations compared with we had a net loss of  for the year ended july  fiscal compared to a net loss of  in the year ended july  fiscal 
the net loss for fiscal and excludes  and  respectively  in preferred stock dividend on preferred shares 
the decrease in our fiscal net loss resulted from a decrease in research and development expenses to  from  that was offset in part by an increase in general and administrative expenses to  from  the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflects the issuance of common stock  options and warrants to employees  consultants and advisors for services rendered that resulted in an increase in non cash charges of  to  from 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in legal and litigation expenses and a reduction in travel expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal reflects the decreased level of research and development activities under our collaboration with elan and under the collaboration with lilly  which terminated in may our interest and miscellaneous income net of interest expense in fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal due to decreases in our cash and short term investments and lower interest rates 
we received income from rental operations net of expense of  in fiscal we did not receive any income from rental operations in fiscal in both of the last two fiscal years  we incurred substantial expenses for financial advisory and other financing services that were not related to a specific financing and  therefore  were accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses  in fiscal and  in fiscal were paid partially through the issuance of common stock and or warrants and options to purchase common stock 
in addition  in fiscal  the minority shareholder s share of the loss generated by generex bermuda  ltd  was as compared to a  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources to date we have financed our development stage activities primarily through private placements of common stock 
in fiscal  we raised an aggregate of approximately  from private placements 
in fiscal we granted stock options  warrants and shares of common stock to employees  consultants and advisors with a value of  for services rendered  all of which are included in general and administrative expenses 
in september  we began a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock from the open market 
through july  we repurchased and cancelled a total of  shares of common stock for  at an average price of per share 
notwithstanding the repurchase of the shares of common stock  our net loss resulted in a decrease in stockholders equity to  at july   versus  at july  at july   we had on hand cash and short term investments primarily notes of us corporations of approximately million versus approximately million at july  we believe that our current cash position is sufficient to meet all of our working capital needs for at least the next months 
beyond that  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise funds through private or public equity financing or from other sources 
if we were unable to raise additional capital as needed  we could be required to scale back or otherwise revise our business plan 
any significant scale back of operations or modification of our business plan due to a lack of funding could be expected to materially and adversely affect our prospects 
in the past we have funded most of our development and other costs with equity financing 
while we have been able to raise equity capital as required  unforeseen problems with our clinical program or materially negative developments in general economic conditions could interfere with our ability to raise additional equity capital as needed  or materially adversely affect the terms upon which such capital is available 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and accrued liabilities to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property and equipment may not be recoverable under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred based upon expected future cash flows  the loss is recognized in the statement of operations 
intangible assets 
we have intangible assets related to patents 
the determination of the related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
in assessing the recoverability of these intangible assets  we use an estimate of undiscounted operating income and related cash flows over the remaining useful life  market conditions and other factors to determine the recoverability of the asset 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets 
estimating accrued liabilities  specifically litigation accruals 
management s current estimated range of liabilities related to pending litigation is based on management s best estimate of future costs 
while the final resolution of the litigation could result in amounts different than current accruals  and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period  management believes the ultimate outcome will not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years more than year years long term debt obligations    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total     transactions with affiliates on may   we advanced  to each of three senior officers  who are also our stockholders  in exchange for promissory notes 
these notes bore interest at percent per annum and were payable in full on may  these notes were guaranteed by a related company owned by these officers and secured by a pledge of  shares of our common stock owned by this related company 
on june   our board of directors extended the maturity date of the loans to october  the other terms and conditions of the loans and guaranty remained unchanged and in full force and effect 
as of july   the balance outstanding on these notes  including accrued interest  was  pursuant to a decision made by the compensation committee as of august   these loans were satisfied through the application of  shares of pledged stock  at a value of per share  which represented the lowest closing price during the sixty days prior to august  prior to january   a portion of our general and administrative expenses resulted from transactions with affiliated persons  and a number of capital transactions also involved affiliated persons 
although these transactions were not the result of arms length negotiations  we do not believe that this fact had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
prior to december   we classified certain payments to executive officers for compensation and expense reimbursements as research and development related party and general and administrative related party because the executive officers received such payments through personal services corporations rather than directly 
after december   these payments have been and will continue to be accounted for as though the payments were made directly to the officers  and not as a related party transaction 
we do not foresee a need for  and therefore do not anticipate  any related party transactions in the current fiscal year 
on august   we purchased real estate with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million from an unaffiliated party 
in connection with that transaction  angara enterprises  inc  a licensed real estate broker that is an affiliate of anna gluskin  received a commission from the proceeds of the sale to the seller in the amount of of the purchase price  or  we believe that this is less than the aggregate commission which would have been payable if a commission had been negotiated with an unaffiliated broker on an arm s length basis 
we utilize a management company to manage all of our real properties 
the property management company is owned by rose perri  anna gluskin and the estate of mark perri  our former chairman of the board 
in the fiscal years ended july  and we paid the management company approximately  and  respectively  in management fees 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise the primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either i the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the effective dates and impact of fin and fin r are as follows i special purpose entities spes created prior to february  the company must apply either the provisions of fin or early adopt the provisions of fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  ii non spes created prior to february  the company is required to adopt fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  iii all entities  regardless of whether an spe  that were created subsequent to january  the provisions of fin were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after january  the company does not have any arrangements with variable interest entities that will require consolidation of their financial information in the financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the changes are intended to improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
additionally  those changes are expected to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either derivatives or hybrid instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts and hedging relationships entered into or modified after june   and for provisions that relate to sfas no 
implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june   apply in accordance with their respective effective dates 
the adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity 
it also requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatory redeemable noncontrolling interests 
the adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the exchange rates between us and canadian currencies and with changes in the interest rates related to our fixed rate debt 
we do not believe that any of these risks will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
at the present time  we maintain our cash in short term government or government guaranteed instruments  short term commercial paper  interest bearing bank deposits or demand bank deposits which do not earn interest 
a substantial majority of these instruments and deposits are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of funds denominated in canadian dollars on deposit in canadian banks to meet short term operating needs in canada 
at the present time  with the exception of professional fees and costs associated with the conduct of clinical trials in the united states and europe  substantially all of our operating expense obligations are denominated in canadian dollars 
we do not presently employ any hedging or similar strategy intended to mitigate against losses that could be incurred as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates between us and canadian currencies 
as of july   we have a fixed rate debt totaling  comprised of  at   at   at   at and  at 
all interest rates are fixed and the instruments mature from july through august as our fixed rate debt matures  we will likely refinance such debt at their existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the fixed interest rates on the maturing debt 
because this debt is fixed rate debt  if interest rates were to increase basis points prior to maturity  there would be no impact on earnings or cash flows 
we have not issued nor do we own any long term debt instruments  or any other financial instruments  for trading purposes and as to which we would be subject to material market risks
