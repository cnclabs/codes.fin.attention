we have approximately locations throughout north america and western europe 
in the beginning of fiscal  we outlined the following success factors that we believe are critical to our business strengthening our growth initiatives to expand our market reach  implementing a highly responsive and cost efficient infrastructure  and improving our financial flexibility 
we made significant progress in each of these areas in fiscal in order to strengthen our growth initiatives and expand our market reach  our long term strategy involves enhancing our supplier relationships  expanding our sales channels  and improving our overall business mix 
recognizing our role as a major sales and service channel for our suppliers  we have enhanced those relationships to target new customer and geographic opportunities  launch new products  develop ikon exclusive offerings  and ensure effective execution in the field 
our national account program and metro market initiative are two of our most important channel expansion strategies 
our national account program targets multi million dollar long term contracts primarily with fortune and large global and private companies 
our revenues from our national account program grew by over compared to fiscal  as we continued to add to our portfolio of customers 
the metro market initiative is designed to expand our presence in major cities in north america that represent significant market share growth opportunities and we continued to increase our share in those markets in fiscal in improving our overall business mix  we focused on higher growth technologies such as color and high end black and white production  which are two important drivers to fuel aftermarket supplies and service revenues 
in color  we experienced a increase from fiscal as higher quality and more affordably priced products introduced by both canon and ricoh throughout fiscal continued to drive the acceptance of color into the workplace 
our strong product mix from industry leaders including canon  ricoh  and konica minolta  with whom we co branded the ikon cpp and ikon cpp e  continues to drive placements in both color and high end black and white equipment 
in services  we recently aligned our customer services  managed services  and professional services businesses to form enterprise services 
enterprise services allows us to better integrate our document management solutions and services to improve our customers productivity and allows us to participate in a larger  faster growing  market segment 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on maximizing the efficiency of our organization through a streamlined infrastructure  comprehensive information technology system  process improvements  and effective asset management 
we continued to implement our e ikon initiative  which describes our consolidation and centralization efforts and process redesign in conjunction with our enterprise resource planning erp conversion  which is primarily based on the oracle e business suite 
we have substantially completed the consolidation and centralization components and are now focused on continued process redesign through six sigma and the implementation of the erp conversion into our remaining businesses 
to date  approximately of our marketplaces and two of our three customer care mega centers in the us are conducting business on the new erp platform 
we will continue to allocate resources to the erp conversion in  with the 
table of contents implementation of the oracle e business suite  and supplementary specialty systems as needed 
we expect additional marketplaces to be converted to the new system in  contingent on other business priorities and appropriate timing 
six sigma is a disciplined business methodology designed to assist companies in increasing profitability by streamlining operations  improving quality  and eliminating possible defects in processes 
at september   we had trained black belts in the program targeting measurable financial and process benefits 
closely linked with our success factors discussed above was our drive to achieve greater financial flexibility 
in december  we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement the us agreement with general electric capital corporation ge to sell certain of our assets and liabilities  solely in our capacity as successor to ios capital  llc iosc  including  without limitation  servicing functions  facilities  systems  and processes relating to our us leasing operations  and to designate ge to be our preferred lease financing source in the us the sale of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the us agreement was effective as of march   on which date ge entered into a five year program agreement with us the us program agreement  and together with the us agreement  the us transaction to provide for the funding of our lease originations in the us on march   ikon office solutions  inc  an ontario corporation and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries ikon canada  entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement the canadian agreement with heller financial canada  an affiliate of ge heller  to sell certain assets including  without limitation  servicing functions  facilities  systems  and processes relating to our canadian leasing operations  and to designate heller to be our preferred lease financing source in canada 
on june   heller assigned its rights and obligations under the canadian agreement to ge vfs canada limited partnership ge canada by executing an assignment and amendment agreement among heller  ge canada  ikon  and ikon office solutions northern ltd  a northwest territory corporation 
the sale of such assets pursuant to the canadian agreement was effective as of june   on which date ikon  ge canada  and ikon office solutions northern ltd 
entered into a canadian rider to the us program agreement the canadian rider  and together with the canadian agreement  the canadian transaction  and together with the us transaction  the transactions to provide for the funding of our lease originations in canada 
we are entitled to receive an origination fee on all new leases underwritten by ge in the us and ge canada in canada  and income from the sharing of gains on certain lease end activities in the us in addition  we will receive fees from ge for providing preferred services for lease generation in the us the preferred fees 
the term of the us program agreement may be renewed by us for a subsequent three or five year period during which we would be entitled to origination fees and income from the sharing of gains on certain lease end activities in the us  but not the preferred fees 
the term of the canadian rider may be renewed by us for a subsequent three or five year period during which we would be entitled to origination fees 
with the proceeds from the transactions  we repaid a significant amount of debt  including million of asset securitization conduit financing agreement debt  million of our notes due the notes  and various other debt repayments totaling approximately million 
as a result of these and other actions taken to improve our liquidity  our total debt to capital ratio declined to from compared to fiscal we paid income taxes directly related to the transactions and subsequent run off of the us retained lease portfolio of million and made a special pension contribution of approximately million 
we also repurchased approximately million of our common stock under our million board authorization 
we expect to continue share repurchases  make further debt reductions  and growth initiative investments 
for fiscal  we had revenues of billion  representing a decline from fiscal this decline was due in large measure to the initial impact of our transition out of the north american leasing operations and the decrease in high margin revenues from that business 
diluted earnings per share were 
refer to results of operations for further discussion of our annual financial statements 
for fiscal  our priorities have evolved to focus on operational leverage  core growth  and expansion 
our objectives for the fiscal year assume continued growth and profitability improvements in our ongoing revenue streams  while we continue to transition out of our captive leasing business in north america 
for fiscal  we expect revenues to decline by approximately to  reflecting to growth in net sales and 
table of contents services  offset by a decline in finance revenues of approximately 
earnings are expected to be in the range of to per diluted share  which reflects a headwind of approximately per diluted share expected from the transactions and double digit improvement in the remaining business 
critical accounting policies we have identified below the accounting policies critical to our business and results of operations 
we determined the critical accounting policies by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we discuss these accounting policies at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we install the majority of the equipment we sell 
revenues for company installed copier printer equipment and technology hardware  included in net sales  are recognized upon credit approval  receipt of a signed sale or lease contract  and a delivery and acceptance certificate 
the delivery and acceptance certificate confirms that the product has been delivered to and accepted by the customer under the sale or lease contract 
revenues for customer installed copier printer equipment and technology hardware  included in net sales  are recognized upon credit approval  receipt of a signed sale or lease contract  and delivery 
generally  we do not offer any equipment warranties in addition to those which are provided by the equipment manufacturer 
revenues for sales of supplies are recognized at time of shipment following the placement of an order from a customer 
revenues for monthly equipment service and facilities management service are recognized in the month in which the service is performed 
professional services revenues are recognized as earned 
revenues for other services and rentals are recognized in the period performed 
for those customer leases under which ikon is the equipment lessor ikon lease paper  the present value of payments due under sales type lease contracts is recorded as revenue within net sales when products are delivered to and accepted by the customer and finance income is recognized over the related lease term 
fees earned under the us program agreement and the canadian rider are recognized as they are earned 
supporting our objective to provide complete solutions to our customers  we generally bundle a customer services agreement with copier printer equipment when sold 
the typical agreement includes a minimum number of copies for a base service fee plus an overage charge for any copies in excess of the minimum 
revenue for each element of a bundled contract is derived from our national price lists for equipment and service 
the national price lists for equipment includes a price range between the manufacturers suggested retail price msrp and the minimum price for which our sales force is permitted to sell equipment without prior approval from a higher level of management within our field services organization 
the price lists for equipment are updated monthly to reflect any vendor communicated changes in msrp and any changes in the fair value for which equipment is being sold to customers 
the national price lists for service reflects the price of service charged to customers 
the price lists for service are updated quarterly to reflect new service offerings and any changes in the competitive environment affecting the fair value for which service is being provided to customers 
the national price lists  therefore  are representative of the fair value of each element of a bundled agreement when it is sold unaccompanied by the other elements 
revenue for a bundled contract is first allocated to service revenue using the fair value per our national price lists 
the remaining revenue is allocated to equipment revenue and finance income based on a net present value calculation utilizing an appropriate interest rate that considers the creditworthiness of the customer  term of the lease  transaction size  and costs of financing 
the equipment revenue is compared to the national price lists 
if the equipment revenue falls within the price range per the national price lists  no adjustment is required 
if the equipment revenue is not within the price range per the national price lists  service and equipment revenues are proportionately adjusted while holding the interest rate constant  so that both service and equipment revenues fall within the price range per the national price lists 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas we perform a goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
we perform the review by comparing the fair value of a 
table of contents reporting unit  including goodwill  to its carrying value 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and judgments including the identification of the appropriate reporting units and the calculation of their fair value 
we use a combination of discounted cash flow projections and market values for comparable businesses to calculate fair value 
our estimate of future cash flows includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions which may differ from actual future cash flows 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods and consist of finished goods available for sale 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
allowances for receivables 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and lease defaults for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to significantly deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  changes to our allowances may be required 
under the transactions  ge assumed substantially all risks related to lease defaults for both the retained and sold lease receivables of our north american leasing business 
income taxes 
income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas  which requires recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of liabilities and assets using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas also provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely 
in assessing the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
however  in the event that we determine the value of a deferred tax asset has fluctuated from its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary 
pension 
accounting for pensions requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  mortality  and employee turnover 
actual results may differ from our actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pension benefits 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed at each measurement date based on the pension plans investment policies and an analysis of the historical returns of the capital markets  adjusted for current interest rates as appropriate 
our current asset allocation targets are to have in equity securities  in debt securities  and in alternate investments 
the discount rate used is determined by consideration of appropriate bond indices 
a change in the expected rates of return from those used would change fiscal pension expense by approximately  a change in the discount rates from those used would change fiscal pension expense by approximately  residual values 
we estimate the residual value of equipment sold under sales type leases 
our residual values are based on the dollar value of the equipment and generally range between to of msrp  depending on the equipment model and lease term 
we evaluate residual values quarterly for impairment 
changes in market conditions could cause actual residual values to differ from estimated values  which could accelerate the write down of the value of the equipment 
as a result of the transactions  this critical accounting policy only affects us for residual values on lease receivables of our european operations  us lease receivables retained by us after the sale of our us leasing operations  and any new leases in north america that are self funded 
other accounting policies 
other accounting polices  not involving the same level of significance as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements

fiscal compared to fiscal revenues change net sales services finance income the decrease in revenues of compared to fiscal  which includes a currency benefit of revenues denominated in foreign currencies impacted favorably when converted to us dollars for reporting purposes  is a result of an overall decrease in finance income  partially offset by an increase in net sales and services as a result of benefits realized from our national account program and other growth platforms  and fees received under the us program agreement and canadian rider 
net sales includes revenues from the sale of copier printer multifunction equipment  direct supplies  and technology hardware 
the increase in net sales includes a currency benefit of 
sales of technology hardware declined by  compared to fiscal  as we did not renew several large customer relationships for and we continue to de emphasize this business 
direct supply sales decreased by approximately  or  compared to the prior year due to lower demand for fax and lower end copier supplies 
equipment revenue  which comprises approximately of our net sales mix  increased by approximately  or  compared to the prior year due mainly to the net impact of the new relationship with ge and continued growth from the sale of color equipment 
revenues generated from the sale of color devices increased by compared to fiscal due to higher demand for these products  particularly higher end color production equipment  as new products were introduced at more affordable prices 
as a percentage of equipment revenue  color devices increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal sales of segment and black and white production equipment devices with page outputs greater than pages per minute decreased slightly compared to fiscal sales of black and white production and color devices  two areas of focus that improve our aftermarket potential  represented of our equipment revenues in fiscal compared to offset by decreases from the sale of segment black and white office equipment devices with page outputs less than pages per minute  fax and other equipment of approximately  compared to fiscal this decrease was due to lower demand for these products compared to the prior year  due in part  to the shift of sales to color devices and lower average selling prices for these products 
as a percentage of equipment revenue  sales of black and white office equipment including miscellaneous equipment represented in fiscal compared to in fiscal origination fees and sales of residual value to ge not recognized as revenue when we had captive finance subsidiaries in north america contributed  of equipment revenue during fiscal services is comprised of enterprise services and other services 
enterprise services consists of managed services  providing on and off site outsourcing services and other expertise  customer services equipment service  and professional services  which focuses on integrating hardware and software technologies that capture  manage  control  and store output for customers document lifecycles 
other services includes rental income on operating leases  income from the sharing of gains on certain lease end activities with ge in the us  and preferred fees 
services increased by  which includes a currency benefit of 
excluding this currency benefit  overall services increased by approximately 
this increase was driven by our growth 
table of contents platforms  such as professional servcies  and the impact of fees received as a result of the new ge relationship  including preferred fees of  during fiscal partially offset by the impact of lease end activities of approximately  we expect to earn approximately  of preferred fees annually until the initial term of the us program agreement terminates on march  customer service revenues which are significantly impacted by the amount and mix of copy volumes  decreased by  or  compared to fiscal although copy volumes increased by  customer services revenues were negatively impacted by an unfavorable impact of price and mix of copy volume compared to fiscal managed services increased by approximately  or  due largely to the recognition of a commercial imaging contract in the first quarter of fiscal  which benefited managed services growth by approximately basis points 
on site facilities management grew from the prior year  due to an increase in new contracts and an improved retention rate 
off site managed services declined largely due to lower copy volumes from transactional business and a decrease in large account activity compared to fiscal professional services  our fastest and most important growth opportunity within services over the next several years  increased by  or  due to the growing demand for assessment and workflow improvements by our customers 
in fiscal  we will continue to make investments to improve utilization  profitability  and continued growth of professional services 
rental revenue decreased by  or  compared to fiscal due to the sale of  of rental assets to ge on march  which we expect will continue to decrease into fiscal finance income is generated by our wholly owned leasing subsidiaries as well as certain lease receivables not sold to ge as part of the us transaction 
the decrease in finance income is primarily due to the impact of the sale of  of lease receivables to ge during fiscal as part of the transactions 
accordingly  lease receivables sold as part of the us and canadian transactions did not generate finance income for us during the second half and fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively 
in addition  finance income decreased due to a decrease in our average financing rate charged on our lease receivables compared to fiscal these decreases were partially offset by the impact of growth in the lease portfolio prior to the transactions and a currency benefit of 
although we will continue to receive finance income under certain leases that will be financed directly by us  our total finance income will decrease in future periods as a result of the transactions 
in fiscal  we expect finance income to decline approximately compared to fiscal as a result of the transactions and the continued run off of the retained us lease portfolio 
gross margin gross margin  net sales gross margin  services gross margin  finance income gross margin  total the decrease in the gross margin percentage on net sales was due to a less favorable mix of equipment  particularly revenues from the sale of higher margin used equipment  growth in lower margin national account program revenues  and continued market competitiveness 
while lower selling prices have fueled increased demand for color and higher volume black and white equipment  the lower end of the black and white equipment market continues to commoditize and remains competitive which caused a negative impact on our margins 
partially offsetting these negative trends was an improved mix of higher margin color equipment revenues and continued benefits realized from the centralization of our supply chain function 
in addition  the net impact of origination fees and sales of equipment residual values to ge positively impacted the net sales gross margin by approximately basis points 
we expect the net impact of origination fees and sales of equipment residual values to ge will negatively impact the net sales gross margin percentage in fiscal the gross margin percentage on services remained consistent compared to fiscal a lower mix of customer services revenues and the impact from the completion of a multi year commercial imaging contract in which no profit was earned negatively impacted services profit margins 
these decreases were offset by the net 
table of contents impact of the new ge relationship income from the sharing of gains on certain lease end activities with ge as well as the preferred fees  which positively impacted the services gross margin by approximately basis points 
the gross margin percentage on finance income increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to european leasing revenues becoming a larger part of the finance income mix in fiscal compared to fiscal european leases are leveraged with a lower amount of debt  therefore european leases generate higher profit margins than our sold north american leases 
in addition  there was a lower leverage ratio on the us lease receivable portfolio that we retained after the us transaction during the second half of fiscal part of this lower leverage was due to the fact that  of interest expense was recorded in interest expense  net during fiscal related to debt that was reclassified from debt supporting finance contracts and unsold residual value non corporate debt to corporate debt beginning on april  as a result  the gross margin on finance income was positively impacted by this change in classification 
partially offsetting the positive impact of these items was a decrease in our average financing rate charged on our lease receivables compared to fiscal in fiscal  we expect finance income to decline approximately compared to fiscal as a result of the transactions and the continued run off of the retained us lease portfolio 
by september   we believe that approximately of the profit we estimated would be generated by the retained us lease portfolio as of the consummation of the us transaction will be earned 
selling and administrative expenses change selling and administrative expenses s a as a of revenue selling and administrative expense  which was unfavorably impacted by  due to foreign currency translation compared to the prior year  decreased by  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal  but remained consistent as a percentage of revenue 
this decrease was due to the following net impact of the transactions the net impact of the us transaction was a significant driver of the change in selling and administrative expense compared to fiscal resulting in a decrease of approximately  approximately  of this decrease was due to no lease default expense being required for either retained or sold iosc lease receivables during the six months ended september  under the terms of the us program agreement  ge assumed substantially all risks related to lease defaults for both the retained and sold lease receivables of iosc 
the remaining decrease in selling and administrative expense as a result of the us transaction was due to the decrease of over employees that were transferred to ge 
partially offsetting the lease default and headcount decreases were increases in fees paid to ge for servicing our retained us lease portfolio of  as well as other corporate costs to support the us transaction including headcount and certain infrastructure enhancements 
the net impact of the canadian transaction did not result in a material change in our selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal other selling and administrative expenses other changes in selling and administrative expenses impacting the company were an increase in pension costs of  compared to fiscal due mainly to the impact of changes in actuarial assumptions compared to fiscal pension expense is allocated between selling and administrative expense and cost of revenues based on number of employees related to those areas 
we expect that our fiscal pension expense will decrease compared to fiscal  an increase in insurance and non income taxes of  compared to due to higher workers compensation costs and property tax expenses compared to fiscal  
table of contents an increase of  related to termination costs of a long term disability plan 
the termination costs are not expected to recur in future fiscal years  an increase of  related to higher legal costs during fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to an adverse judgment we received on a claim in canada 
during fiscal  we received a favorable judgment on a matter in the us and we recognized income of  an increase in bad debt expense  lease default expense excluding the impact of the transactions  and concessions made to customers of  this increase was due mainly to the impact of further consolidation of our customer care centers  which caused a temporary disruption in our collection efforts during fiscal we expect to begin to realize the benefits of this consolidation during fiscal  which we expect will reduce this expense 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in compensation related expenses  primarily the result of headcount reductions compared to fiscal as we continue our efforts to consolidate and centralize certain administrative functions 
the impact of headcount reductions on compensation expense was partially offset by higher employee salary levels compared to fiscal in fiscal  we expect to experience further improvements in selling and administrative expense as we realize the benefits of a late fourth quarter headcount reduction of employees as well as the benefit of a similar reduction expected in the first half of fiscal in addition  we expect to continue to realize benefits of lower selling and administrative expense as a result of the transactions 
these decreases will be partially offset by the impact of annual salary increases and an increase in consulting and audit fees as we execute our sarbanes oxley internal control certification efforts  which we are required to be in compliance with as of september  other change loss from divestiture of businesses  net operating income loss from early extinguishment of debt  net interest expense  net taxes on income net income diluted earnings per common share during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of  from the transactions resulting from the difference between the carrying amount of assets sold and proceeds received and certain costs associated with the transactions 
operating income decreased in fiscal by compared to fiscal  as a result of the factors discussed above 
during fiscal  we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of  as a result of the repurchases of debt and other financing related actions discussed on page under debt structure 
during fiscal  we recorded a loss from the early extinguishment of debt of  as a result of the repurchase of various debt instruments discussed on page the decrease in interest expense  net was due to lower average outstanding debt balances in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our assumption of iosc s public debt the notes due the notes  convertible notes due the convertible notes and the notes  collectively  the additional corporate debt as part of the us transaction  interest on this debt  which was reported in finance interest expense prior to april   is now reported as interest expense  net 
this change resulted in 
table of contents approximately  of additional interest expense to be recorded in interest expense  net compared to fiscal we expect to experience a modest increase in interest expense  net  as the additional corporate debt will be included on this income statement line for the entire fiscal year  partially offset by the benefit of lower average outstanding balances of other debt during fiscal the effective income tax rate was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this decrease was due to the reversal of valuation allowances on state net operating loss carryovers of  as a result of the tax gain generated by the us transaction in fiscal in addition  during fiscal  we reversed valuation allowances on our canadian net operating loss carryovers of  as a result of improved financial performance achieved by our canadian operations 
furthermore  during fiscal  we recorded a benefit of  due mainly to the favorable settlement of a us federal tax audit 
our tax valuation allowance was  and  at september  and  respectively 
for fiscal  we expect our effective income tax rate to increase to due to the impact of our complete utilization of net operating loss carryovers in canada 
diluted earnings per common share were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the diluted earnings per common share calculation reflects the impact of the convertible notes issued in may we account for the effect of the convertible notes in the diluted earnings per common share calculation using the if converted method 
under that method  the convertible notes are assumed to be converted to shares weighted for the number of days outstanding in the period at a conversion price of  and interest expense  net of taxes  related to the convertible notes is added back to net income 
the diluted earnings per share calculation also reflects the dilutive impact of employee stock options and awards

ina and ie provide copiers  printers  color solutions  and a variety of document management service capabilities through enterprise services 
these segments also include our captive finance subsidiaries in north america including those now divested  see business recent developments and europe  respectively

ikon north america change net sales services finance income finance interest expense loss on divestiture of businesses operating income approximately of our revenues are generated by ina  accordingly  many of the items discussed above regarding our consolidated results are applicable to ina 
net sales decreased by due to a decline in direct supply sales of  compared to fiscal as a result of lower demand for fax and lower end copier supplies 
additionally  there was a decline in technology hardware of  as a result of several large customer relationships that were not renewed for fiscal as we continue to de emphasize these businesses 
these decreases were offset by an increase in equipment sales of  compared to fiscal  due mainly to the net impact of the new relationship with ge and continued growth in color revenues 
origination fees and sales of residual value to ge not recognized as revenue when we 
table of contents had captive finance subsidiaries in north america contributed  of equipment revenue during fiscal services increased by primarily due to the net impact of the preferred fees received from ge as a result of the new ge relationship of  an increase in professional services of  as we continue to focus on this area of growth  and an increase in managed services of  due largely to the recognition of a commercial imaging contract in the first quarter of fiscal on site facilities management grew from the prior year  due to an increase in new contracts and an improved retention rate

finance income and finance interest expense decreased as a result of the transactions 
we incurred a loss of  from the divestiture of the us and canadian leasing businesses resulting from the difference between the carrying amount of the assets sold and proceeds received and certain costs associated with the transactions 
operating income increased primarily due to higher profit margins on finance income compared to fiscal  offset by slightly lower margins in both net sales  services and the impact on the loss on divestiture of businesses  and a decrease to finance interest expense of  as a result of the reclassification of the additional corporate debt

finance income increased primarily as a result of strengthened foreign currencies  which resulted in a benefit of  operating income in fiscal decreased due to the operational performance discussed above  partially offset by a favorable impact of currency 
corporate and eliminations  which is not treated as a business segment  includes certain selling and administrative functions including finance  supply chain  and customer service 
ina and ie are not presented on a comparative basis because certain administrative costs of ina are included in corporate and eliminations  and excluded from the presentation of results of ina  but are included in the presentation of results of ie 
operating losses in corporate and eliminations  which were  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  increased due to higher legal costs due to a charge related to an adverse judgment received in fiscal compared to a favorable ruling in fiscal in which we recognized income 
we also had a headcount increase in corporate  which corresponded to an increase in salaries 
finally  there was an increase in pension expense related to corporate employees 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues change net sales services finance income 
table of contents the decrease in revenues compared to fiscal  which included a currency benefit of revenues denominated in foreign currencies impacted favorably when converted to us dollars for reporting purposes  was primarily the result of our actions to exit  sell  or downsize certain non strategic or unprofitable businesses telephony  education and technology hardware businesses  and certain digital print centers during fiscal  which accounted for of the decline in fiscal net sales includes revenues from the sale of copier printer multifunction equipment  direct supplies  and technology hardware 
the decrease in net sales includes a currency benefit of 
sales of technology related hardware a business the company exited as described above  such as computers  routers and servers  contributed to of the net sales decline compared to fiscal revenues from the sale of copier printer equipment decreased by  or  compared to fiscal due to changes in product sales mix  delays in purchasing decisions by our customers  and lower selling prices as new technologies were introduced at lower price points  particularly in color equipment 
revenues from the sale of black and white equipment declined in the mid single digits  while revenues from the sale of color equipment grew by over compared to fiscal in fiscal  approximately of copier printer equipment revenues were from sales of high end black and white and color products  compared to approximately in fiscal sales of supplies decreased by compared to fiscal due to declines in the sale of fax supplies
