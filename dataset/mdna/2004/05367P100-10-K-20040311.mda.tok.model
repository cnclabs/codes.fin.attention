item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  market  sell and support a wide range of software and hardware for digital media production  management and distribution 
digital media are video  audio or graphic elements in which the image  sound or picture is recorded and stored as digital values  as opposed to analog  or tape based  signals 
our diverse range of product and service offerings enables customers to make  manage  and move media 
in april  we unveiled a new family of products called the digital nonlinear accelerator  or avid dna  a powerful series of specialized computer hardware products engineered specifically for media processing 
when paired with our next generation nonlinear editing software  the avid dna family enables professionals to achieve real time functionality and superior image and sound quality when capturing  editing  finishing and outputting dv  sd and hd video formats 
the avid dna family includes avid media composer adrenaline and avid newscutter adrenaline fx systems  both of which began shipping in the second quarter of  and avid xpress pro and avid mojo  which began shipping in the third quarter of the avid media composer adrenaline system leverages the key features of its predecessor to offer improved quality  speed and performance in high pressure time sensitive television and film editing and production environments 
the avid newscutter adrenaline fx expands news editing capabilities by offering speed  reliability and a range of professional news oriented editing and workflow features in a turnkey pc based platform 
avid xpress pro software and the avid mojo accelerator deliver professional video  film  and audio editing capabilities including automatic color correction  real time digital and analog output and are qualified to run on a wide range of windows based cpus as well as on the power mac g the avid dna family also includes the avid ds nitris system which began shipping in the fourth quarter of the avid ds nitris product is a powerful finishing tool delivering real time effects and color correction 
our future results will depend  in part  on market acceptance of these new products 
we generally derive nearly half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risk that changes in foreign currency could materially impact  either positively or adversely  our revenues  net income loss and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly re evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for product returns and exchanges  allowance for bad debts  the valuation of inventories and income tax assets  and reserves for recourse under financing transactions 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we recognize revenue from sales of products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable  and all other revenue recognition criteria of sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  are met 
we follow the guidance of sop for all of our revenue recognition since all of our products and services are software related 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element  typically maintenance and support  is deferred and the remaining portion of the revenue is recognized 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and only recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
in most cases  our products do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires minimal effort and is not typically performed by us 
however  a growing number of transactions  those typically involving orders from end users of a significant number of products for a single customer site  such as news broadcasters  may require that we perform an installation effort that we deem to be complex and non routine 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenue from either the products shipped or the installation services until the installation is complete 
in addition  if such orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenue is recognized until the customer s acceptance of the products and services has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
telephone support  enhancements and unspecified upgrades typically are provided at no additional charge during the product s initial warranty period generally between three and twelve months  which precedes commencement of the maintenance contracts 
we defer the fair value of this support period and recognize the related revenue ratably over the initial warranty period 
we also from time to time offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for each of these elements that is undelivered at the time of product shipment  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognizes that revenue only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the upgrade have been satisfied 
in  approximately of our revenue was derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
most of our resellers and distributors are not granted rights to return products to us after purchase  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
within our video segment  distributors of our avid xpress dv  avid xpress pro and avid mojo product lines have a contractual right to return a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the return provision for these distributors has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
however  some channel partners  particularly those who resell our audio products  are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation and price protection 
channel partners within our audio segment are granted return rights on a case by case basis but are not provided a contractual right to do so 
in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances  as a reduction of revenues  in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making such estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers  and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions  and other known factors 
we maintain a rolling history of returns on a product by product basis and analyze returns and credits by product category 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our estimates of potential product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from actual experience 
at the time of a sale transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenue is only recognized if we are reasonably assured that collection will occur 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
at that same time  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable  considering the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally  but can be up to  days after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is successful  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming the other criteria of sop are satisfied 
allowance for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions we maintain allowances for estimated bad debt losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for products or services 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances  we analyze accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we provide third party  lease financing options to many of our customers 
avid is not generally a party to the leases  however  during the terms of these leases  which are generally three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance upon default by the end user  but such liability is limited in the aggregate 
see footnote i to our consolidated financial statements in item we record revenue from these transactions upon the shipment of our products since we believe that our collection experience with similar transactions supports our assessment that the fee is fixed or determinable 
we have operated these programs for over eight years and to date defaults under the program have consistently ranged between and 
we maintain reserves for estimated recourse losses under this financing program based on these historical default rates 
while we have experienced insignificant losses from defaults to date under this program  deterioration in the financial condition of our customers who participate in the program could require additional reserves 
inventories inventory in the digital media market  including our inventory  is subject to rapid technological change or obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down inventory to its realizable value to reflect estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon assumptions about future inventory demand generally for the following twelve months  and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than estimates by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and if it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized  we then establish an appropriate valuation allowance 
based on the level of the deferred tax assets as of december  and the level of historical us taxable income  management has determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets in the us is sufficient to warrant the establishment of a full valuation allowance 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one period or over many periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative restructuring and other costs  net amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenues our net revenues are derived mainly from the sales of computer based digital  non linear media editing systems and related peripherals  licensing of related software  and sales of related software maintenance contracts 
this market has been  and we expect it to continue to be  highly competitive 
a significant portion of these revenues is generated by sales near the end of each quarter  which can impact our ability to accurately forecast revenues on a quarterly basis 
increasingly  revenues are also being derived from sales of solutions encompassing multiple products and networking capabilities that enable users to share and manage media throughout a project or organization 
such solution sales may include training and installation services  as well as workflow management assistance  to be provided by us or a third party 
depending upon the complexity of the arrangement and the level of our involvement  the revenues resulting from these solution sales may be deferred for one or more quarters while the services are being performed 
net revenues increased from million in to million in revenues in our video business increased million or  while revenues in our audio business grew by million or 
we estimate that approximately  or million  of the growth in the video segment during relates to increased sales volume of our products  including the new avid dna family of products released during the remaining  or million  of growth is attributed to higher average selling prices of our various products  which in was particularly impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange rates  especially with respect to the euro 
average selling prices also include the impact of price changes  discounting  and mix higher or lower end of products sold 
for the audio segment  the revenue growth in is primarily the result of higher average selling prices of our products  including the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
net revenues decreased from million in to million in revenues in our video business declined million or  while revenues in our audio business grew by million or 
for  we believe that a portion of the video business decline was due to the general worldwide economic slowdown 
more specifically  we believe that a reduction in advertising spending worldwide had a negative impact on post production video business  causing our customers to reduce capital spending pending an upturn in their businesses 
revenue in our video segment was also adversely impacted by pricing reductions and discounts  driven in part by the introduction of new lower end products by us and our competitors 
our audio business contributed favorably to revenues during due primarily to increased volume associated with strong demand for our new flagship digital audio workstation  pro tools hd  which was introduced in january we generally see an increase in revenues when we introduce a significant new product or product enhancement 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for  compared to for and for the increase in direct selling from to was due primarily to the growth in sales to our broadcast customers  which generally require a longer selling cycle with more direct support 
we expect sales to broadcast customers will be an area of potential revenue growth in the future 
sales in the americas have typically accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues  while sales in europe and asia pacific represent the remaining 
however  the relative percentages of sales among the regions can vary based on  among other things  the impact of currency exchange rate variations on revenues  the timing of revenue recognition of solutions sales  and local economic conditions 
international sales ie  sales to customers outside the united states and canada accounted for of our and net revenues  compared to for international sales increased by approximately million or in compared to  and decreased by million or in compared to the increase in international sales in occurred principally in europe  with the impact of currency translation being a factor 
half of the decrease in international sales in compared to occurred in europe  with the remainder occurring in the asia pacific region and latin america 
management believes these declines were attributable to the economic climate and  in asia  also to the impact of currency translation 
gross margin costs of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  post sales customer support costs related to maintenance contract revenue and other services  the assembly  testing  and distribution of finished products  warehousing  and royalties for third party software included in our products 
the resulting gross margin fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware and software included in the systems sold  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  sales of aftermarket hardware products such as disk drives  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our gross margin increased to in compared to in  which had decreased from in the gross margin increase in reflects primarily a positive impact from higher average selling prices of our products  which in was particularly impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange rates  especially with respect to the euro 
average selling prices also include the impact of price changes  discounting  and mix higher or lower end of products sold 
we also achieved reduced material and manufacturing overhead costs in the video segment in as compared to the decrease in gross margin during primarily reflects the impact of price reductions  discounts and promotions and higher manufacturing costs  primarily in the audio segment  partially offset by a favorable product mix  a positive margin impact from the audio segment delivering third party promotional software for which revenue had previously been deferred  and a positive impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
research and development research and development expenses increased by million or in compared to  and decreased by million  or  in compared to the increase in expenditures in was primarily due to higher personnel related costs  in particular accrued expenses associated with our bonus plan 
these costs were somewhat offset by reductions in other spending categories 
the decrease in expenditures in was primarily due to lower personnel related costs in the video business as a result of restructuring actions taken during  as well as lower depreciation expense  partially offset by higher hardware development costs and the absence of third party funding of certain research and development projects which occurred in research and development expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues  to in from in  primarily as a result of the higher revenue base in research and development expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues  to in from in  primarily due to the decreased expenses noted above 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses increased million or in compared to  and decreased by million  or in compared to the increase in was primarily due to higher personnel related costs  including salaries and related taxes and benefits as well as expenses associated with our bonus plan and commissions expense due to higher revenues 
we also had higher net foreign exchange losses specifically  remeasurement gains and losses on net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies  offset by hedging gains and losses  which are included in marketing and selling expenses  in these increases were partially offset by lower marketing expenses such as advertising and direct mailings 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower marketing expenditures for such items as trade shows  advertising and direct mailings  as well as lower personnel related expenses resulting from various restructuring actions that occurred in marketing and selling expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  primarily due to the higher revenue base in marketing and selling expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  primarily due to the decreased expenses noted above 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by million or in compared to  and decreased by million  or in compared to the increase in expenditures in was primarily due to higher personnel related costs  in particular expenses associated with our bonus plan and  to a lesser extent  higher insurance costs and external legal fees as a result of complying with the sarbanes oxley act of the decrease in occurred primarily as a result of reduced external legal fees  lower personnel related expenses and depreciation  partially offset by expense related to executive severance benefits incurred in general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  primarily due to the increases in expenses discussed above 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  primarily due to the reductions in expenses discussed above 
restructuring and other costs our restructuring actions during consisted of severance and facility charges made to increase efficiencies and reduce expenses  and a revision to a previous restructuring charge recorded on unutilized space 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for employee terminations and million for unutilized space in santa monica  california that included a write off of leasehold improvements of million 
also during  we recorded charges of million related to a revision of our estimate of the timing and amount of future sublease income associated with the daly city facility discussed below based on working with a real estate broker during the year to attempt to sublease the space 
in december  we recorded a charge of approximately million in connection with vacating excess space in our daly city  california  tewksbury  massachusetts  and montreal  canada facilities 
the tewksbury charge of million was a revision of our estimate related to the august restructuring action discussed below  based on our attempts to sublet the related space during the remaining portion of the charge for daly city and montreal was the result of our ceasing to use a portion of each facility in december and hiring real estate brokers to assist in finding subtenants 
we believe the daly city charge of million reflects a depressed real estate market in the area 
during  we implemented various restructuring plans to decrease costs through the consolidation of operations and the reduction of approximately jobs worldwide 
in connection with these plans  we recorded charges to operating expenses totaling million 
the restructuring charges included approximately million for severance and related costs of terminated employees and million for facility vacancy costs  of which million represented non cash charges relating to the disposition of leasehold improvements that were abandoned upon vacating the related properties in and these restructuring actions were expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million  and management believes that these savings were achieved 
in connection with these and prior plans  we made cash payments in of million related to personnel severance related costs and million related to vacated facilities 
in  we made severance related payments of million  facilities related payments of million and wrote off million of leasehold improvements 
in we made severance related payments of million and facilities related payments of million 
as of december  we have an aggregate obligation under leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities of approximately million  including facilities in daly city  california  tewksbury  massachusetts  london  england and montreal  canada 
we have a remaining restructuring accrual balance for vacated facilities at december  of million  which represents the difference between this aggregate obligation and expected future subleases income under actual or estimated potential sublease agreements 
see notes i and m to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  in connection with the resignation of two executive officers  we incurred and recorded a charge of million for termination benefits as specified in the employment contracts of the officers 
through december   cash payments of approximately million had been made in full satisfaction of our obligations 
as a result  in  we recorded a credit of million to restructuring and other costs  net  associated with a reduction in the estimated liability 
also in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our italian subsidiary to a third party which established the entity as a distributor of avid products 
the sale was completed in the first quarter of in  we recorded a loss of approximately million related to the sale  including a reserve of million for our guarantee of the new entity s line of credit with a bank 
this guarantee ended on january  without requiring any cash payment by us 
accordingly  in the quarter ended march   we recorded a credit associated with the reversal of the reserve  which was included under the caption restructuring and other cost  net  where the charge was originally recorded 
in addition  during each of the quarters ended june  and  we received payments of million in full satisfaction of a note received as partial consideration from the buyers of the italian subsidiary 
these payments were recorded as credits to restructuring and other costs  net as the note was fully reserved when initially recorded 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in connection with our august acquisition of softimage  we allocated million of the purchase price to intangible assets consisting of completed technologies  work force  and trade name and recorded million as goodwill 
included in the operating results for is amortization of these intangible assets and goodwill of million 
as of december   these intangible assets  including goodwill  were fully amortized 
from to we recorded additional intangible assets as we acquired the following companies or their assets rocket network  inc and bomb factory digital  inc in  iknowledge  inc 
in  inews  llc in  and the motion factory  inc and pluto technologies international inc 
in in connection with these acquisitions  we allocated million to identifiable intangible assets consisting of completed technologies and work force  and million to goodwill 
included in the operating results for  and is amortization of these intangible assets of million  million and million  respectively 
as of january   in connection with the adoption of sfas  we reclassified million of a previously recorded assembled work force intangible to goodwill and  as a result  ceased amortizing this amount 
during and  we recorded no goodwill or assembled work force amortization as compared to approximately million in for these acquisitions 
the unamortized balance of the identifiable intangible assets relating to these acquisitions was million at december  we expect amortization of these intangible assets to be approximately million in  million in and million in other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  generally consists of interest income  interest expense and equity in income of non consolidated companies 
during  other income and expense  net  increased million from million in this increase was due to increased interest income earned on higher average cash and investment balances  as well as to the absence in of a impairment charge recorded in  discussed below 
during  other income and expense  net  decreased million  from million in this decrease was primarily due to two items in that did not recur in a net gain of million recorded upon the sale of all the common stock received as consideration for our investment in avid sports llc  and our equity in the net income of inews related to their fourth quarter operations of million we acquired inews in january 
additionally  interest income decreased in due to a decline in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  lower average cash and investment balances on hand 
offsetting these decreases in interest and other income  net  was reduced interest expense in compared to  as a result of the prepayment in february of a note payable to microsoft in connection with our acquisition of softimage 
we recorded impairment charges of million during and million in for an investment in an unconsolidated entity accounted for under the cost method  after these charges  our investment was fully written off 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was   and  respectively  for   and the tax rate in each year is significantly affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december  and the level of historical us and foreign taxable income and losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets and a majority of the foreign net deferred tax assets 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for this differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to our foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed at different rates 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for this differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to state taxes  while savings due to the us federal research tax credit more than offset a higher level of taxes from our foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed at different rates 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for this differs slightly from the federal statutory rate of  as savings due to the us federal research tax credit offset a higher level of taxes from our foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed at different rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date through both private and public sales of equity securities  including stock option exercises from our employee stock plans  as well as through cash flows from operations 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
with respect to cash flow  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in in each case  cash generated from operating activities primarily reflects net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization 
in addition  in  cash flows also reflect cash generated through increases in deferred revenues and accrued expenses  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
in  cash flows also reflect cash generated through a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenues 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventories during for  cash flows also reflect a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
at december  and  we held inventory in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
these balances include stockroom  spares  demonstration equipment inventories at various locations  and inventory at customer sites related to shipments for which we have not yet recognized revenue 
we review these balances regularly for excess quantities or potential obsolescence and make appropriate adjustments to write down the inventories to reflect their estimated realizable value 
accounts receivable increased by million to million at december  from million at december   driven primarily by the year over year increase in net revenues 
these balances are net of allowances for sales returns  bad debts and customer rebates  all of which we estimate and record based on historical experience 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  the decline in days sales outstanding is primarily attributable to strong collection efforts and payment terms on solution sales where cash collections often precede revenue recognition 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in we purchased marketable securities in the amount of million  net of proceeds from sales of marketable securities  as part of our program for investing excess cash 
the marketable securities in which we invest typically include corporate obligations  asset backed securities  commercial paper  taxable municipal obligations and us treasuries and other governmental obligations 
we also expended cash of about million for the purchase of rocket network  inc and as initial payment for our purchase of the assets of bomb factory digital  inc in a second payment of approximately million for bomb factory was made in early  after resolution of acquisition related contingencies  with the final payments totaling million due on various dates through december we purchased million of property and equipment during  compared to million in and million in we also acquired million of property and equipment under capital leases during purchases of property and equipment in both and were primarily of computer hardware and software to support research and development activities and our information systems 
purchases of property and equipment in were primarily of computers and furniture and fixtures purchased in connection with the relocation of the digidesign facility to daly city  california and hardware and software to support research and development activities and our information systems 
our capital spending program for is currently expected to be approximately million  including purchases of hardware and software to support activities in the research and development  information systems and manufacturing areas  as well as for facilities renovations 
however  this amount could increase in the event we enter into strategic business acquisitions or for other reasons 
as discussed in note r to our consolidated financial statements  in january  we acquired nxn software ag for a purchase price of million euros approximately million 
during  we made a cash payment of approximately million to acquire selected assets of iknowledge  inc as part of the purchase agreement  we may be required to make certain contingent cash payments  depending upon the future revenues of the products acquired from iknowledge through december as of december   contingent payments paid to date or owed were immaterial 
during  we also made a cash payment  net of cash acquired  of million for the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in inews 
also during  we received million in cash upon the sale of all the common stock received as consideration for our investment in avid sports llc 
during  we purchased the assets of two companies  pluto technologies and the motion factory  for a total of approximately million in cash and million of guaranteed bonuses paid in in connection with the acquisition of the motion factory  we may be required to make future contingent cash payments limited in the aggregate to million  depending upon future revenues and or gross margin levels through december of the products including technology we acquired from the motion factory 
to date no contingent payments have been paid or are owed 
during  and  we generated cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively  net of common stock repurchases  from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
the level of cash generated in represents an unusual amount of stock option exercise activity due to a significant increase in our stock price and is not necessarily expected to recur within the next few years 
in  we made a prepayment in full satisfaction of a million note to microsoft 
in connection with restructuring efforts during and prior periods  as well as with the identification in and of excess space in various locations  we also have cash obligations of approximately million under leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities 
we have an associated restructuring accrual of million at december  representing losses to be incurred or expected to be incurred on subleases of space or lease vacancies 
these payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate an earlier termination 
all restructuring related payments will be funded through working capital 
see notes i and m to our consolidated financial statements 
our cash requirements vary depending upon factors such as our planned growth  capital expenditures  the possible acquisition of businesses or technologies complementary to our business and obligations under past restructuring programs 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so  or that we could do so on favorable terms 
contractual and commercial obligations including off balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth future payments that we are obligated to make  as of december   under existing debt agreements  leases and other arrangements in thousands less than after total year years years years capital lease obligations  operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   other contractual arrangements that may result in cash payments consist of the following in thousands total year less than years transactions with recourse   stand by letter of credit   through a third party  we offer lease financing options to our customers 
during the terms of these financing arrangements  which are generally for three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user 
our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances 
as of december   our maximum exposure under this program was million 
we have a stand by letter of credit at a bank that is used as a security deposit in connection with our daly city  california office space lease 
in the event of a default on our lease the landlord would  as of december   be eligible to draw against this letter of credit to a maximum of million  subject to an annual reduction of approximately million but not below million 
the letter of credit will remain at million throughout the remaining lease period  which runs through september as of december   we were not in default of this lease 
we conduct our business globally and  consequently  our results from operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts  which generally have one month maturities  to reduce exposures associated with the foreign exchange exposures of certain forecasted third party and intercompany receivables  payables and cash balances 
at december   we are in a sell position with respect to the euro  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar and in a buy position with respect to the singapore dollar 
our currency position at december  is summarized as follows in thousands approximate us dollar equivalent euro  japanese yen  british pound  singapore dollar  canadian dollar australian dollar new accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we have determined that our multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of sop and therefore eitf is not applicable to us 
in july  the eitf reached consensus on issue  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software eitf 
eitf concludes that software related elements include software related products and services such as those listed in paragraph of sop  as well as other deliverables for which the software is essential to their functionality eg  computer hardware 
elements included in arrangements that do not qualify as software related elements are to be accounted for under the guidance of eitf and not sop eitf is applicable for revenue arrangements entered into after october  we believe that the elements included in our multiple element arrangements all qualify as software related elements and therefore eitf is not applicable to us 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with characteristics of a controlling financial interest or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
additionally  companies with significant investments in variable interest entities  even if not required to consolidate the variable interest entity  have enhanced disclosure requirements 
as amended  this interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the adoption of fin no

in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under sfas no 
it is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity which establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on a fixed monetary amount known at inception  variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares or variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in certain factors that may affect future results some of the statements in this form k relating to our future performance constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based upon management s current expectations and involve known and unknown risks 
realization of any of these risks may cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements 
certain of these risks are as follows our performance will depend in part on continued market acceptance of our new digital nonlinear editing products 
we recently introduced several new digital non linear products  including the digital nonlinear accelerator and next generation media composer and newscutter systems  as well as avid xpress pro with avid mojo and avid ds nitris hardware 
we will need to continue to focus marketing and sales efforts on educating potential customers and our resellers about the uses and benefits of these products 
the future success of certain of these products  such as avid ds nitris  which enable high definition production  will also depend on consumer demand for appliances  such as television sets and monitors  that utilize the high definition standard 
in addition  there are several other risks involved with offering new products in general  including  without limitation  the possibility of defects or errors  failure to meet customer expectations  delays in shipping new products and the introduction of similar products by our competitors 
at the same time  the introduction and transition to new products could have a negative impact on the market for our existing products  which could adversely affect our revenues and business 
the broadcast market is large  widely dispersed  and highly competitive  and we may not be successful in growing our customer base or predicting customer demand in this market 
we are currently building our presence in the digital broadcast market and have augmented our newscutter product offering with the avid unity for news products  and the server  newsroom  and browser products obtained in the pluto and inews acquisitions 
the broadcast market is distinguished from our traditional video business in that turn key  fully integrated  complex solutions including the configuration of unique workflows  rather than discrete point products  are frequently required by the customer 
success in this market will require  among other things  creating compelling solutions and developing a strong  loyal customer base 
in addition  large  complex broadcast orders often require us to devote significant sales  engineering  manufacturing  installation  and support resources to ensure their successful and timely fulfillment 
as the broadcast market converts from analog to digital  our strategy has been to build our broadcast solutions team in response to customer demand 
to the extent that customer demand for our broadcast solutions exceeds our expectations  we may encounter difficulties in the short run meeting our customers needs 
meanwhile  our competitors may devote greater resources to the broadcast market than we do  or may be able to leverage their market presence more effectively 
if we are unsuccessful in capturing and maintaining a share of this digital broadcast market or in predicting and satisfying customer demand  our business and revenues could be adversely affected 
our revenues are becoming increasingly dependent on sales of large  complex broadcast solutions 
we expect sales of large  complex broadcast solutions to continue to constitute a material portion of our net revenue  particularly as news stations convert from analog  or tape based  processes to digital formats 
our quarterly and annual revenues could fluctuate significantly if o sales to one or more of our customers are delayed or are not completed within a given quarter  o the contract terms preclude us from recognizing revenue during that quarter  o news stations migration from analog processes to digital formats slows down  o we are unable to complete complex customer installations on schedule  o our customers reduce their capital investments in our products in response to slowing economic growth  and o any of our large customers terminate their relationship with us or significantly reduce the amount of business they do with us 
our products are complex  and may contain errors or defects resulting from such complexity 
as we continue to expand our product offerings to include not only point products but also end to end solutions  our products have grown increasingly complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
such errors or defects could cause us to issue corrective releases and could result in loss of revenues  delay of revenue recognition  increased product returns  lack of market acceptance  and damage to our reputation 
the markets for our products are competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the digital video  audio  and d markets are highly competitive  with limited barriers to entry  and are characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features  and accelerate the release of new products 
some of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  support  and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may use these resources to lower their product costs  allowing them to reduce prices to levels at which we could not operate profitably 
delays or difficulties in product development and introduction may also harm our business 
if we are unable to compete effectively in our target markets  our business and results of operations could suffer 
in addition to price  our products must also compete favorably with our competitors products in terms of reliability  performance  ease of use  range of features  product enhancements  reputation and training 
new product announcements by our competitors and by us also could have the effect of reducing customer demand for our existing products 
new product introductions also require us to devote time and resources to training our sales channels in product features and target customers  with the temporary result that the sales channels have less time to devote to selling our products 
we have a significant share of the professional audio market  and therefore growth in this market will depend in part on our ability to successfully introduce new products 
products from our digidesign division have captured a significant portion of the professional audio market 
digidesign s strong performance in recent years reflects a series of successful product introductions 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  new audio products and enhancements of our existing audio products 
to that end  we recently acquired the assets of bomb factory digital  inc  a company that produces digital audio processing products that complement or plug in to our pro tools product line 
the timely development of new or enhanced products and the integration of newly acquired products  such as bomb factory digital  inc s audio processing product  is a complex and uncertain process  and we could experience design  manufacturing  marketing  or other difficulties that delay or prevent our development and introduction of new or enhanced products  or our integration of acquired products  which  in turn  could harm our business 
when we acquire other companies or businesses  we become subject to risks that could hurt our business 
we periodically acquire businesses and form strategic alliances 
for example  in december  we acquired the assets of bomb factory digital  inc  a company that produces digital audio processing products  and in january  we acquired nxn software ag  a company that manufactures asset and production management systems specifically targeted for the entertainment and computer graphics industries 
the risks associated with such acquisitions  alliances  and investments include  among others o the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the target companies  o the failure to realize anticipated returns on investment  cost savings and synergies  o the diversion of management s time and attention  o the dilution existing stockholders may experience if we decide to issue shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase our common stock as consideration in the acquisition in lieu of cash  o the potential loss of key employees of the target company  o the difficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws  o the impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers of the target company or our customers or suppliers  and o unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process  including product quality issues and legal contingencies 
such acquisitions  alliances  and investments often involve significant transaction related costs and could cause short term disruption to normal operations 
in the future we may also make debt or equity investments 
if we are unable to overcome or counter these risks  it could undermine our business and lower our operating results 
our use of independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities could expose us to risks that could adversely impact our revenues 
independent firms and contractors  some of whom are located in other countries  perform some of our product development activities 
we generally own the software developed by these contractors 
the use of independent firms and contractors  especially those located abroad  could expose us to risks related to governmental regulation including tax regulation  intellectual property ownership and rights  exchange rate fluctuation  political instability and unrest  natural disasters  and other risks  which could adversely impact our revenues 
an interruption of our supply of certain key components from our sole source suppliers could hurt our business 
we are dependent on a number of specific suppliers for certain key components of our products 
we purchase these sole source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
we generally do not carry significant inventories of these sole source components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements 
if any of our sole source vendors should fail to supply or enhance such components  it could imperil our supply of these components and our ability to continue selling and servicing products that use these components 
similarly  if any of our sole source vendors should encounter technical  operating or financial difficulties  it could threaten our supply of these components 
while we believe that alternative sources for these components could be developed  or our products could be redesigned to permit the use of alternative components  an interruption of our supply could damage our business and negatively affect our operating results 
qualifying and supporting our products on multiple computer platforms is time consuming and expensive 
our software engineers devote significant time and effort to qualify and support our products on various computer platforms  including most notably  microsoft and apple platforms 
computer platform modifications and upgrades require additional time to be spent to ensure that our products will function properly 
to the extent that the current configuration of the qualified and supported platforms changes or we need to qualify and support new platforms  we could be required to expend valuable engineering resources  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results are dependent on several unpredictable factors 
the revenue and gross profit from our products depend on many factors  including o mix of products sold  o cost and proportion of third party hardware included in such products  o product distribution channels  o acceptance of our new product introductions  o product offers and platform upgrades  o price discounts and sales promotion programs  o volume of sales of aftermarket hardware products  o costs of swapping or fixing products released to the market with defects  o provisions for inventory obsolescence  o competitive pressure on product prices  o costs incurred in connection with solution sales  which typically have longer selling and implementation cycles  and o timing of delivery of solutions to customers 
changes in any of these factors could affect our operating results 
our operating results could be harmed by currency fluctuations 
we generally derive nearly half of our revenues from customers outside of the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income loss  and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we record gains  and losses associated with currency rate exchanges on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience currency gains or losses 
our operating costs are tied to projections of future revenues  which may differ from actual results 
our operating expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenues 
such future revenues are difficult to predict 
a significant portion of our business occurs near the end of each quarter  which can impact our ability to precisely forecast revenues on a quarterly basis 
further  we are generally unable to reduce quarterly operating expense levels rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations upon which expense levels are based  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
poor global macroeconomic conditions could disproportionately impact our industry 
in recent years  our customers in the media  broadcast and content creation industries delayed or reduced their expenditures in part because of unsettled economic conditions 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends primarily on the overall demand for our products 
if global economic conditions worsen  demand for our products may weaken  and our business and results of operations could suffer 
terrorism  acts of war  and other catastrophic events may seriously harm our business 
terrorism  acts of war  or other catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our employees  facilities  suppliers  distributors  resellers or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue and operating results 
the increasing presence of these threats has created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and stock price in ways that cannot be predicted 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorism  acts of war  and other international conflicts 
if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our resellers  distributors  and suppliers  our ability to successfully deploy our products may be harmed 
we sell many of our video products and services  and substantially all of our audio products and services  indirectly through resellers and distributors 
the resellers and distributors of our video segment products typically purchase avid software and avid specific hardware from us  and third party components from various other vendors  in order to produce complete systems for resale 
any disruption to our resellers and distributors  or their third party suppliers  could reduce our revenues 
increasingly  we are distributing our products directly  which could put us in competition with our resellers and distributors and could adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  our resellers could diversify the manufacturers from whom they purchase products to sell to the final end users  which could lead to a weakening of our relationships with our resellers and could adversely affect our revenues 
most of the resellers and distributors of our video products are not granted rights to return products after purchase  and actual product returns from such resellers and distributors have been insignificant to date 
however  our revenue from sales of audio products is generally derived from transactions with distributors and authorized resellers that typically allow limited rights of return  inventory stock rotation and price protection 
accordingly  reserves for estimated returns  exchanges and credits for price protection are provided  as a reduction of revenues  upon shipment of the related products to such distributors and resellers  based upon our historical experience 
to date  actual returns have not differed materially from management s estimates 
however  if returns of our audio segment products were to exceed estimated levels  our revenues and operating results could be adversely impacted 
if we become dependent on third party hardware for our products  our operating results could be harmed 
our gross profit margin varies from product to product depending primarily on the proportion and cost of third party hardware included in each product 
from time to time  we add functionality and features to our products 
if we effect such additions through the use of more  or more costly  third party hardware  and are not able to increase the price of such products to offset these increased costs  our gross profit margin on these products could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected 
our future growth could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel 
our success depends upon the services of a number of key employees including members of our executive team and those in certain technical positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could harm our business 
our success also depends upon our ability to attract highly skilled new employees 
competition for such employees is intense in the industries and geographic areas in which we operate 
in the past  we have relied on our ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent 
recent proposed accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair our future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs 
if we are unable to compete successfully for our key employees  our business could suffer 
our websites could subject us to legal claims that could harm our business 
some of our websites provide interactive information and services to our customers 
to the extent that materials may be posted on and or downloaded from these websites and distributed to others  we may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  or other theories of liability based on the nature  content  publication or distribution of such materials 
in addition  although we have attempted to limit our exposure by contract  we may also be subject to claims for indemnification by end users in the event that the security of our websites is compromised 
as these websites are available on a worldwide basis  they could potentially be subject to a wide variety of international laws 
regulations could be enacted that restrict our internet initiatives 
federal  state  and international authorities may adopt new laws and regulations governing the internet  including laws and regulations covering issues such as privacy  distribution  and content 
for example  the european union has issued several directives regarding privacy and data protection  including the directive on data protection and the directive on privacy and electronic communications 
the enactment of legislation implementing such directives by member countries is ongoing 
the enactment of this and similar legislation or regulations could impede the growth of the internet  harm our internet initiatives  require changes in our sales and marketing practices and place additional financial burdens on our business 
we could incur substantial costs protecting our intellectual property or defending against a claim of infringement 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions  as well as required hardware components and hardware security keys  to protect our proprietary technology 
however  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time unauthorized parties have obtained  copied  and used information that we consider proprietary 
policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology is costly and time consuming and we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software exists 
we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
we occasionally receive communications suggesting that our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
it is our practice to investigate the factual basis of such communications and negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products or relating to current or future technologies  we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology or unable to negotiate licenses for the use of others intellectual property  our business could be impaired 
we are currently involved in various legal proceedings  including patent litigation 
an adverse resolution of any such proceedings could harm our business and reduce our results of operations 
see note i  commitments and contingencies in our audited financial statements 
the sarbanes oxley act of has caused our operating expenses to increase and has put additional demands on our management 
the sarbanes oxley act of and newly enacted rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market impose new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and independent accountants 
in order to comply with the new legislation  we have had to hire additional personnel and use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
these actions have increased our operating expenses 
in addition  the new legislation has made some corporate actions more challenging  such as proposing new or amendments to stock option plans  which now require stockholder approval  or obtaining affordable director and officer liability insurance 
the added demands imposed by the new legislation may also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers  key personnel and members of our board of directors 
if we experience problems with our third party leasing program  our revenues could be adversely impacted 
we have an established leasing program with a third party that allows certain of our customers who choose to do so to finance their purchases 
if this program ended abruptly or unexpectedly  some of our customers might be unable to purchase our products unless or until they were able to arrange for alternative financing  and this could adversely impact our revenues 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has experienced volatility in the past and could continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon a number of factors  most of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o changes in our quarterly operating results  o shortfalls in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  o changes in analysts recommendations or projections  o fluctuations in investors perceptions of us or our competitors  o shifts in the markets for our products  o development and marketing of products by our competitors  o changes in our relationships with suppliers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  or customers  and o global macroeconomic conditions 
further  the stock market has experienced volatility with respect to the price of equity securities of high technology companies generally  and this volatility has  at times  appeared to be unrelated to or disproportionate to any of the factors above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk our primary exposures to market risk are financial  including the effect of volatility in currencies on asset and liability positions and revenue and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies  and the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
foreign currency exchange risk we generally derive nearly half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income loss and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
there are two objectives of our foreign currency forward exchange contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on the company s net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these forward exchange contracts typically mature within days of purchase 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   we had million of forward exchange contracts outstanding  denominated in euros  japanese yen  british pounds  singapore dollars  canadian dollars  and australian dollars  as hedges against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
for the year ended december   net losses of million resulting from forward exchange contracts were recorded  which offset net transaction and translation gains of million on the related assets and liabilities 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term us and canadian government and government agency obligations 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity
