item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview our primary mission is to develop proprietary human therapeutics by leveraging our integrated discovery platform to increase the speed  efficiency and quality of pharmaceutical product discovery and development 
we have generated a substantial development pipeline of small molecule cancer compounds that we believe are therapeutically differentiated and commercially valuable 
the pipeline is led by xl  our phase cancer compound  and includes xl  xl  xl  xl and additional novel cancer related compounds arising from our gene to drug platform 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash and investments 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funding to be received from current collaborators will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next two years 
changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
we have collaborations with major pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical companies based on the strength of our technologies and biological expertise in order to support additional development of our proprietary product candidates 
through these collaborations  we obtain license fees and research funding  together with the opportunity to receive milestone payments and royalties from research results and subsequent product development 
in addition  many of our collaborations have been structured strategically to provide us access to technology to more rapidly advance our internal programs  while at the same time retaining rights to use the same information in different industries or for different development opportunities 
we have ongoing commercial collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical companies  including bayer cropscience lp formerly aventis usa lp  bayer corporation  bristol myers squibb company two collaborations  cytokinetics  inc  dow agrosciences llc  elan pharmaceuticals  inc  merck co  inc two collaborations  renessen llc  scios inc  schering plough research institute  inc and smithklinebeecham corporation 
as our company has matured and our development efforts have intensified  we have restructured the organization as needed to reallocate resources and enhance the efficiency of our operations 
we believe that these efforts have strengthened us by enabling us to achieve an appropriate functional balance within the organization 
we expect to continue to use corporate partnering as a strategic tool to cultivate our assets  fund our operations  and to expand the therapeutic and commercial potential of our pipeline 
business combinations as part of our business strategy  we consider merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products on the market  later stage compounds  technologies to accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts  or access to capital 
genomica on december   we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of genomica corporation genomica  a bio informatics software company 
the acquisition of genomica was completed in january the purchase price for genomica  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based on an independent valuation 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded net tangible assets of million including cash and investments of million  developed technology of  and goodwill of million 
at the same time  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was expensed in to operations 
in december  in connection with the acquisition of genomica  exelixis adopted an exit plan for genomica 
under this exit plan  we terminated genomica s entire workforce and abandoned its leased facilities in boulder  colorado and sacramento  california 
the estimated costs of the exit plan amounted to million  consisted primarily of employee severance and benefits and lease abandonment costs  and were included as part of the liabilities assumed in the acquisition 
as of december   the remaining actions to be taken under the exit plan consist of approximately  in residual payments related to the lease obligation for the facility in boulder  colorado  net of estimated payments from sub lessors  which are expected to continue until the termination of the lease in artemis in may  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh  a privately held genetics and functional genomics company organized under the laws of germany 
in december and january  we exercised call options for the remaining of the outstanding capital stock of artemis 
the total purchase price for artemis  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based upon an independent valuation 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  net tangible assets of million and intangible assets including goodwill of million 
agritope in december  we completed our acquisition of agritope  inc as a result of the acquisition  agritope became our wholly owned subsidiary  and we subsequently changed its name to exelixis plant sciences  inc critical accounting estimates we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates revenue recognition most of our revenues are generated from complex research and licensing arrangements 
these research and licensing arrangements may include up front non refundable payments 
although these up front payments are generally non refundable  under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we defer the revenues under these arrangements and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the research term 
our research and license arrangements may also include milestone payments 
although these milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize the milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone being recognized at the date the milestone is achieved  and the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
it is our understanding that there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenue 
other companies have adopted an alternative acceptable milestone revenue recognition policy whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by an immaterial amount compared to total revenue recognized 
revenues from chemistry collaborations are generally recognized upon the delivery of accepted compounds 
goodwill and intangible impairment as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
furthermore  our impairment evaluation of goodwill requires management to exercise judgment in the identification of our reporting units 
the impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level  which currently management has identified to be one unit  the single operating segment disclosed in our current financial statements 
in the future  management may determine that the impairment tests should be performed at a level below the single operating segment disclosed in our current financial statements  depending upon whether certain criteria are met 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues total revenues and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total revenues dollar increase percentage increase the increase in revenues from to was driven primarily by our october corporate collaboration with glaxosmithkline and an increase in revenue under our chemistry collaborations established with cytokinetics  inc  elan pharmaceuticals  inc  merck  inc  scios inc 
and schering plough research institute  inc to jointly design custom high throughput screening compound libraries 
this increase was partially offset by the reduction in revenue from the scheduled conclusion of our collaborations with pharmacia corporation in february and protein design labs in may the increase from to resulted primarily from the impact of our corporate collaborations with glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb and protein design labs and from compound deliveries under our chemistry collaborations  partially offset by a reduction of revenue from pharmacia due to the scheduled february conclusion of our collaboration 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total r d expense dollar increase percentage increase research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies  consulting and facilities costs 
the increase in over resulted primarily from the following costs personnel staffing costs increased to million primarily due to expansion of our drug discovery and development operations  merit pay increases for employees and increasing employee benefit costs 
salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs are included in personnel costs 
lab supplies lab supplies expense increased to million due primarily to an increase in drug discovery activities such as lead optimization  high throughput screening and compound synthesis 
consulting consulting expense increased to million  primarily due to activities related to advancing our clinical and preclinical development programs 
these activities included filing an ind application for xl at the end of the first quarter of and commencing phase clinical studies for xl in june  advancing a series of development candidates and back up compounds into preclinical testing in anticipation of filing additional ind applications  manufacturing drug substance for those compounds to support preclinical studies  and manufacturing xl to support initiation of registration trials 
facilities facilities expense increased to million primarily due to our expansion into an additional building in south san francisco  california as a result of our expanding drug discovery and development operations 
the increase in over resulted primarily from the following costs personnel staffing costs increased by to million  which was directly attributable to an increase in personnel 
the increase in personnel was to support new collaborative arrangements and our internal proprietary research efforts 
salary  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs are included in personnel costs 
lab supplies as a result of the increase in personnel  our compound collaborations and the significant expansion of our drug discovery operations  lab supplies expense increased to million during licenses and consulting in order to support new collaborative arrangements  manufacture the rebeccamycin analog to ensure adequate clinical supply  complete data analysis for phase clinical trials  plan for registration trials of the rebeccamycin analog and to advance xl through preclinical toxicology testing  license and consulting expenses increased to million during the table below summarizes the status of our current drug candidates program clinical status xl expect to initiate a phase clinical trial in the nd quarter of xl currently in phase clinical trials xl expect to file ind application in the st quarter of xl expect to file ind application in the nd quarter of xl expect to file ind application in early we currently estimate that typical phase clinical trials last approximately one year  phase clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase clinical trials last approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time generally varies substantially according to factors relating to the trial  such as the type and intended use of the product candidate  the trial design and ability to enroll suitable patients 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future as we advance xl and xl through clinical trials  file anticipated ind applications and initiate clinical programs for xl and xl  advance xl toward ind status and make progress in our other preclinical programs with the goal of filing additional ind applications and initiating additional clinical programs in and we currently do not have estimates of total costs to reach the market by a particular drug candidate or in total 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may not result in the necessary regulatory approvals  which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize products 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total g a expense dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staffing costs to support our research activities  facilities costs and professional expenses  such as legal fees 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in non cash stock compensation expense of million  as described below  partially offset by increased insurance and patent costs 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in non cash stock compensation expense of million  partially offset by an increase in costs associated with personnel and facilities to support expansion of our research and development operations 
acquired in process research and development in  we recorded in process research and development expense of million related to the artemis acquisition 
the valuation of in process research and development was determined by management based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income approach for each of the three significant in process projects 
the in process projects relate primarily to the development of technologies that use vertebrate genetic model organisms  zebrafish and mice  to identify and functionally validate novel genes in vivo 
these genes can be used as novel screening targets or as the basis for secreted proteins in clinically and commercially relevant diseases 
the income approach estimates the value of each acquired in process project based on its expected future cash flows 
the valuation analysis considered the contribution of the core technology as well as the percent complete of each in process research and development project 
the expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of  which was considered commensurate with the overall risk and percent complete of the in process projects 
the purchased in process technology was not considered to have reached technological feasibility nor have any alternative future use  and accordingly  it was recorded as a component of operating expenses 
as of december   the in process projects have been substantially completed 
impairment of goodwill in  we acquired million of goodwill in connection with our genomica acquisition 
at the same time  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was expensed in to operations 
the impairment was calculated in accordance with sfas  by estimating the present value of future cash flows for the ongoing genomica licensing business using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the impaired goodwill represented excess purchase price  which we viewed as economically equivalent to financing costs for the acquired cash and investments 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles total amortization of goodwill and intangibles and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  amortization dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease goodwill and intangibles result from our acquisitions of genomica  artemis and agritope renamed exelixis plant sciences 
the decrease in and as compared to was primarily related to our adoption of sfas  whereby goodwill is no longer amortized 
restructuring charge in the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring of our research and development organization designed to reallocate resources and enhance the efficiency of our operations 
the restructuring includes a reduction in force of research personnel located in south san francisco  california and t bingen  germany  closure of our t bingen facility and relocation of certain research activities and employees from t bingen to south san francisco 
the reduction in force is expected to conclude in the first quarter of in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded a charge of approximately  during consisting primarily of severance  retention bonuses and legal and outplacement services fees 
through the first quarter of  we expect to record additional expenses related to this restructuring plan of approximately million excluding any gain or loss associated with the reclassification of currency translation adjustment from equity  which will be recorded upon the wind down of our t bingen facility 
this estimate is subject to change depending upon the settlement of contractual commitments related to the t bingen location  changes in the euro exchange rate  and other factors 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan  which resulted in a reduction in workforce of employees primarily from our us research operations 
accordingly  we recorded a restructuring charge of  comprised primarily of involuntary termination benefits 
the restructuring plan was implemented in order to facilitate our evolution into a fully integrated drug discovery company and the reallocation of resources to permit greater focus on building our expanding portfolio of development programs 
other income expense  net total other income expense  net and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  other income  net dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by interest expense incurred on notes payable  bank obligations and capital lease obligations 
the decrease in compared to and in compared to was the result of a decrease in interest income due to an overall decline in interest rates coupled with an increase in interest expense related to an increase in notes payable and bank obligations 
discontinued operations in april  we transferred the genomica software business to visualize for future consideration of up to million in license fees and royalty payments 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction  visualize obtained a license with all rights and obligations to third parties currently licensing the genomica software  including the sole right to further develop and license the software to other third parties 
royalties that we receive  if any  will be recorded in the period they are earned as a gain in discontinued operations 
in addition  visualize assumed the lease obligation for genomica s abandoned facility in sacramento  california 
we retained an internal use license for the software 
as a result of this transaction  we reported the operating results of genomica and the estimated loss on the sale of genomica as discontinued operations 
for the period beginning january  and ending with the discontinuation of genomica s operations in april  genomica s operating results consisted of revenues of approximately  and an operating loss of approximately  the loss on the sale of genomica includes the write off of goodwill of approximately  partially offset by a change in estimate for genomica s lease obligation for the sacramento facility assumed by visualize of approximately  income taxes we have incurred net losses since inception and  consequently  have not recorded any us federal or state income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision of approximately  during the year ended december  related to income earned in our foreign operations 
due to a favorable outcome on a position we took with the german tax authorities  we reversed the tax provision in we do not expect to pay income taxes on our foreign operations for the year ended december  as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we had federal and california research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in under the internal revenue code and similar state provisions  certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they are used 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity  payments and loans from collaborators  equipment financing facilities and interest income 
in addition  we acquired genomica in december  including million in cash and investments 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash and investments 
we have incurred net losses since inception  including a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   and expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funding to be received from current collaborators will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next two years 
it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors  including payments received under collaborative and agreements  the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent research and development projects  and the expansion of our product and clinical development efforts as well as development of manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products  if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
we have contractual obligations in the form of operating and capital leases  notes payable and licensing agreements 
these are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following chart details our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years minimum purchase obligations   notes payable and bank obligations     licensing agreements     capital lease obligations    convertible promissory note and loan    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    sources and uses of cash our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash used in operating activities relates primarily to funding net losses and changes in deferred revenue from collaborators  partially offset by non cash charges related to acquired in process research and development  depreciation and amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangibles 
we expect to use cash for operating activities for at least the next several years as we continue to incur net losses associated with our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided of million for and million for changes in cash from investing activities are primarily due to purchases  sales and maturities of short term investments  changes in restricted cash  purchases of property and equipment  and cash acquired from acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and our administrative infrastructure  including the purchase of property and equipment to support our expanding drug discovery and development operations 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for changes in cash from financing activities are primarily due to loans from collaborators  issuance of common stock and payments and proceeds associated with equipment financing facilities 
in  we completed a follow on public offering of approximately million shares of registered common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
we finance property and equipment purchases through equipment financing facilities  such as capital leases  notes and bank obligations 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities  merger and acquisition expenses and other general corporate purposes 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on capital leases  notes  bank obligations and loans from collaborators 
these contractual obligations are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are included in the contractual obligation chart located above in the cash requirements section of management s discussion and analysis 
under our collaboration agreement with gsk  we have the option to sell additional shares of common stock to gsk and draw up to another million under a loan facility for use in our efforts under the collaboration 
gsk may elect to expand the collaboration  upon which the loan facility  as well as development funding and milestone payments  would be significantly expanded 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity vie to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest  or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
for arrangements entered into with vies created prior to january   the provisions of fin are required to be adopted at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after march  the provisions of fin were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january  we have two existing joint venture arrangements  one with bayer corporation and one with bayer cropscience lp 
we have not yet completed our evaluation as to whether the existing joint venture arrangements would be considered vies or whether we may be considered the primary beneficiary of these joint venture arrangements 
we expect to complete the review in the first quarter of additional information related to these joint venture arrangements is provided below 
genoptera in december  we formed genoptera llc with bayer corporation to focus on developing insecticides and nematicides for crop protection 
under the terms of the genoptera operating agreement  bayer provides of the capital necessary to fund the operations of genoptera and has the ability to control the entity with a ownership interest 
we own the other interest in genoptera without making any capital contribution and report the investment in genoptera using the equity method of accounting 
bayer s initial capital contributions to genoptera were million in january and another million in january bayer is also required to contribute cash to genoptera in amounts necessary to fund its ongoing operating expenses 
genoptera has incurred losses since inception 
since our carrying value of this investment is zero and there is no obligation to fund future losses  we have not recorded equity method losses for genoptera to date 
revenues recognized under this joint venture approximated  and of our total consolidated revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
agrinomics in july  exelixis plant sciences formerly agritope  inc and bayer cropscience formerly aventis cropscience usa lp formed agrinomics llc to conduct a research  development and commercialization program in the field of agricultural functional genomics 
as a result of our acquisition of exelixis plant sciences  we own a interest in agrinomics  while bayer cropscience owns the remaining interest 
bayer cropscience agreed to make capital contributions to agrinomics in cash totaling million over a five year period  which has all been contributed as of december  exelixis plant sciences contributed certain technology and a collection of seeds generated using such technology 
in connection with our acquisition of exelixis plant sciences  no portion of the purchase price was assigned to agrinomics 
although we are required to account for our investment in agrinomics under the equity method  we do not expect to include in our consolidated financial statements a proportionate share of the losses of agrinomics until such time  if ever  that we make a capital contribution to agrinomics 
we do not have a requirement to make capital contributions to agrinomics 
revenues recognized under this joint venture approximated  and of our total consolidated revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements see the information appearing under the preceding caption  recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
at december   and  we had investments of approximately million and million  respectively 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
by policy  we limit our investments to money market instruments  debt securities of us government agencies and debt obligations of us corporations 
we manage market risk by our diversification requirements  which limit the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we manage credit risk by limiting our purchases to high quality issuers 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
at december   and  we had long term debt outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments  or a combination thereof 
the fair value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and as of december  and  a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
it is assumed the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from our estimate 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the operations of our german subsidiaries 
the revenues and expenses of our german subsidiaries are denominated in euro 
at the end of each reporting period  the revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period  and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period 
fluctuations in exchange rates  therefore  impact our financial condition and results of operations as reported in us dollars
