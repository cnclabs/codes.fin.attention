item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations information in response to this item is incorporated herein by reference to the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of the annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of market risk to be portfolio valuations and fluctuations in interest rates 
we consider the management of risk essential to conducting our businesses 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
as a business development company  we invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of companies  non investment grade cmbs and the bonds and preferred shares of collateralized debt obligations 
our investments are generally subject to restrictions on resale and generally have no established trading market 
we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors in accordance with our valuation policy 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make 
we determine fair value to be the amount for which an investment could be exchanged in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
our valuation policy considers the fact that no ready market exists for substantially all of the securities in which we invest 
our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio 
we will record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful  or when the enterprise value of the portfolio company does not currently support the cost of our debt or equity investments 
enterprise value means the entire value of the company to a potential buyer  including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time 
we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  our equity security has also appreciated in value 
the value of investments in publicly traded securities are determined using quoted market prices discounted for restrictions on resale  if any 
without a readily available market value and because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
in addition  the illiquidity of our investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of debt and equity securities at times when it may be otherwise advantageous for us to liquidate such investments 
in addition  if we were forced to immediately liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation would be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net investment income 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
we utilize our revolving line of credit as a means to bridge to long term financing 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with long term fixed rate debt and equity 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected the net income by less than over a one year horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate 
we invest in cmbs bonds  which were purchased at prices that are based in part on comparable treasury rates 
the fair value of these cmbs bonds may change as interest rates change over time 
we have entered into transactions with financial institutions to hedge against movement in treasury rates on certain of the higher rated cmbs bonds and cdo bonds 
these transactions  referred to as short sales  involve receiving the proceeds from the short sales of borrowed treasury securities  with the obligations to replenish the borrowed treasury securities at a later date based on the then current market price  whatever that price may be 
risks in these contracts arise from movements in the value of the borrowed treasury securities due to changes in interest rates and from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
if the value of the borrowed treasury securities increases  we will incur losses on these transactions  which are limited only by the increase in value of the borrowed treasury securities  conversely  the value of the hedged cmbs and cdo bonds would likely increase 
if the value of the borrowed treasury securities decreases  we will incur gains on these transactions which are limited only by the decline in value of the borrowed treasury securities  conversely  the value of the hedged cmbs and cdo bonds would likely decrease 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty in connection with these transactions 
the total obligations to replenish borrowed treasury securities  including accrued interest payable on the obligations  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the net proceeds related to the sales of the borrowed treasury securities plus the additional cash collateral provided under the terms of the transactions were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amount of the hedge will vary from period to period depending upon the amount of higher rated cmbs bonds and cdo bonds that we own and have hedged on the balance sheet date
