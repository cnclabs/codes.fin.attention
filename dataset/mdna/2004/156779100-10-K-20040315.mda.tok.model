table of contents the period covered by this discussion featured a number of events or arrangements that had or will have a significant effect on our financial condition and performance 
you will find the following matters described in this discussion or through a reference to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
new services offerings 
new offerings have contributed significantly to revenue growth in in our hrs segment examples include esource  official ceridian check ceridian direct deposit  human resource outsourcing and sourceweb and in our comdata segment examples include businesslink and ecash 
these service offerings are more fully described in part i  item of this report 
growth in orders and customers in and after experiencing growth in the value of hrs orders of from to  hrs order values grew an additional in major contributors to hrs order growth in included customers for our human resource outsourcing offering and a mid year contract with the us department of defense for work life effectiveness and employee assistance for members of the military services 
for comdata  new customer and order growth was particularly strong in our stored value card business in both and while transportation services also added new customers to a lesser degree in both years 
our measurements of customer retention for both segments also showed improvement over the prior year in both and acceleration of w information delivery 
in  we succeeded in advancing the processing  delivery and billing of w information for our customers 
this accomplishment resulted in the recognition of million of revenue in december that would otherwise been recognized in january because the costs associated with w activities are reported as incurred throughout the year  essentially this entire amount was reflected in earnings before income taxes 
this means that revenue included two contributions for w activities and results will include w revenue only in december 
the effect of changing currency exchange rates 
the strength of the canadian dollar and british pound sterling against the us dollar  particularly in  contributed significantly to the revenue increases for our ceridian canada and ceridian centrefile subsidiaries

svs provides stored value card and related processing principally to the retail industry

due to the unusual and non recurring nature of the loss  we have reported the loss as other expense income 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the status of accrued exit costs and revised the estimated amounts to reduce the severance cost provisions made by hrs in the first quarter of by million and in the first quarter of by million and by comdata in the first quarter of by million 
we also incurred additional expense in hrs for severance costs of million  involving employees  and other exit costs of million and in comdata for severance costs of million  involving employees  and other exit costs of million 
we paid all of the additional hrs severance costs during the fourth quarter of the other exit costs largely represented lease commitments  net of expected recoveries 
also in the fourth quarter of  hrs recorded a million write down of the carrying values of certain marketable equity and cost based investments  recorded a million loss related to derivatives and wrote off the million carrying value of an abandoned software product 
the investment write down related primarily to our december cost based investment in usih preferred stock in connection with a joint marketing agreement  which was converted to common stock as a result of an initial public offering in october the million loss on derivatives represented the amortization of a portion of the previously deferred million gain on derivatives recorded in the first quarter of the remaining million was charged to operations during as the derivatives to which the deferred gain relates expired 
we also recorded million of other unusual costs in hrs for a litigation settlement 
the gain on sale of marketable securities of million related to our sale of hotjobs 
com  ltd 
common stock and is further described in note g  investing activity  to our consolidated financial statements 
the gain on derivative securities of million resulted from the application of fas as amended and interpreted at that date 
the second quarter litigation costs include a settlement of million and associated costs of million related to litigation involving comdata and a provision of million for litigation costs not allocated to our business segments 
the litigation settlement and associated costs at comdata related to an action brought by flying j  inc the nature and facts and circumstances of this litigation are fully disclosed in note k  legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and the resulting settlement is fully disclosed in part ii  item  legal proceedings  of our quarterly report on form q  for the quarterly period ended june  the additional provision of million for litigation costs not allocated to our business segments related to disputes involving postretirement benefits 
during the first quarter of  we took certain actions in comdata and hrs that were expected to improve operational efficiency  take advantage of technological opportunities and further focus our hrs businesses 
these actions resulted in accrued exit costs of million and asset write downs of million 
we paid these accrued exit costs in full by the end of we also recovered million of costs accrued during the first quarter of  due to a revision of the estimated cost related to those actions 
in february  comdata terminated an outsourced contract for transaction processing and software development and brought those activities in house 
this action was intended to improve management control over these activities and reduce costs 
the termination charge of million was recorded and paid during the first quarter of in order to implement the in house operation  comdata hired a number of personnel from the outsourcing contractor and made incremental investments in 
table of contents capitalized equipment and software of million in the same quarter 
during the course of  comdata realized cost savings of approximately million related to this action 
in march  hrs transferred most of its lifeworks employee effectiveness services operation in boston  massachusetts into a related operation in philadelphia  pennsylvania  and we decided to sell our usertech employee training business 
as a result of these actions  unrecoverable goodwill of million related to usertech and million of equipment related to the boston operation were recorded as asset write downs 
we sold usertech in the third quarter of in addition  hrs charged million of severance costs for approximately employees and million of excess facility costs to operations and recorded these costs as accrued exit costs 
these charges were offset in part by the recovery of million of the estimated severance costs accrued in the first quarter of  due primarily to a reduction in the scale of the downsizing of the st 
louis  missouri customer services operations 
also in march  hrs reassessed its strategy for developing software to serve its middle market payroll and tax filing customers and conducted an impairment review of internally developed software related to this effort 
as a result  million of unrecoverable cost related to this software development effort was recognized as an asset write down

table of contents cash flows cash balances and operations our cash and equivalents decreased by million to million during as we used operating cash flows and cash balances to fund investing activities  repay debt and contribute to our retirement plan trusts 
the operating cash flows for included payments of million for employer contributions to our pension plans for employees in the us and the united kingdom 
in  our cash and equivalents increased by million to million as operating cash flows provided funds for investing and to reduce debt 
during  cash and equivalents increased by million to million as strong operating cash flows fully funded investing activities and provided funding for debt reduction 
during  our operating cash flows were million compared to million in this decrease of million was due mostly to an increase in pension contributions of million 
when comparing the working capital cash flows for and  the million additional cash usage of other current assets and liabilities is largely due to an increase in comdata receivables and a decrease in comdata drafts and settlements payable 
our operating cash flows from continuing operations decreased by million during as compared to primarily due to an increase in receivables at the end of cash provided by earnings from continuing operations grew by million in while cash outflows from continuing operations working capital activities reduced operating cash flows by million 
our operating cash flows from earnings included the million after tax effect of the nonrecurring comdata litigation costs described in the previous section of this discussion entitled unusual items 
the decrease in the amount of depreciation and amortization largely reflects the elimination from earnings of the charge for goodwill amortization effective for the increased use of cash for working capital activities reflected a net cash outflow from a build up of receivables in of million compared to a million net cash inflow from liquidation of receivables in when comparing the working capital cash flows for to  the total million increase in cash utilized by receivables related substantially to comdata receivables activity and was offset in part by an increase of million in cash provided by comdata drafts payable in those periods 
comdata receivables increased by million during compared to a decrease of million during the increase during reflected increases in factoring  business fleet and retail card receivables  offset in part by a decrease in other transportation receivables 
the relationship of the period end date and the timing of weekly draft clearing operations at comdata at december  also affected the comparison of net cash provided by or utilized for drafts payable and receivables outstanding in and investing our investing activity related to capital expenditures of million for property and equipment and million for software and development costs  including an additional million for sourceweb  which we offered to customers in the first quarter of in march  we spent million to acquire  shares and a warrant to purchase an additional  shares of ultimate

we described these transactions further in the note to consolidated financial statements entitled investing activity 

table of contents during  our investment in capital expenditures included million for property and equipment and million for software and development costs  of which million of software and development spending took place during the first quarter 
software and development costs also included a payment of million to ultimate to acquire a non exclusive software license to be used in the development of a web enabled payroll hr self service offering for hrs called sourceweb 
cash expended for acquisitions during included million for minority investments  including million for usih  intended to expand product offerings in hrs as further discussed in the note to the consolidated financial statements entitled investing activity 
proceeds from sales of businesses and assets of million for principally represented our sale of common stock of hotjobs 
com  ltd  which provided proceeds of million 
financing during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million on the open market at an average net price of per share 
proceeds from exercises of stock options and employee stock plan purchases amounted to million during compared to million in also during  we entered into two capital lease arrangements resulting in an obligation of million to be paid over a month period 
we also reduced our borrowings under our domestic revolving credit facility by million and our receivable securitization facility by million 
at december   under our million domestic revolving credit facility  we had million of unused borrowing capacity 
of that amount  we have designated million as backup for the amount outstanding under the receivables securitization facility  which leaves million available for other purposes 
in june  comdata entered into a million receivables securitization facility 
the facility has up to a three year term and uses certain of comdata s trade receivables as collateral for borrowings 
at december   million had been drawn against and remained outstanding under this facility 
we used those proceeds and additional payments of million to reduce borrowings under our million revolving credit facility to million at the end of these advances  along with a million letter of credit  left us with unused borrowing capacity of million  of which we designated million as backup to the comdata receivables securitization facility 
proceeds from exercises of stock options and employee stock plan purchases during amounted to million compared to million in higher market prices for ceridian stock  particularly in the second quarter of  resulted in a higher level of option exercises  which produced the increased proceeds 
we purchased  shares of our common stock on the open market during the last half of for million at an average price  including commissions  of per share 
when we disposed of the million net liabilities of arbitron discontinued operations at the time of the arbitron spin off  our retained earnings increased by that amount 
during the third quarter of  we reduced this amount and our net deferred tax asset by million based on the filing of tax returns for the entities involved in the arbitron spin off 
we discuss the arbitron spin off in the section entitled discontinued operations of the note to our consolidated financial statements entitled supplementary data to statements of operations 
our financing activities in largely involved transactions related to the arbitron spin off 
at the time of the arbitron spin off  advances of million from the january credit facility  a million arbitron payment and existing cash balances funded the required early retirement of the million of senior notes outstanding and payment of the million balance outstanding under the million domestic revolving credit facility dated july the redemption of senior notes required a payment of million 
the establishment of the january credit facility resulted in the payment of million for origination costs to be amortized over the term of the facility 
during the second quarter of  we drew an additional million of advances on the january credit facility in connection with the litigation settlement described earlier in this discussion under the heading unusual items 
during  we reduced outstanding advances by payments of million to million 
another million of the credit line was utilized for letters of credit at december  in addition  payments of million and currency translation adjustments of million extinguished the balance of

for further information on financing cash flows  see a note to our consolidated financial statements entitled financing  and the following section entitled liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to meet our liquidity needs from existing cash balances  cash flows from operations and borrowings under external credit facilities 
cash balances and cash flows are discussed under the section of this discussion entitled financial condition 
cash flows from operations are primarily influenced by the same factors that influence revenue as discussed in a preceding section of this discussion entitled results of operations and in several of the items in the following section entitled cautionary factors that could affect future results 
cautionary factors of particular relevance include those that refer to the effects of government regulations on such matters as the timing of tax payments  interest rates  employee benefits  and funds transfer activities  our ability to attract new customers and retain our existing customers  and general economic conditions 
our expenditures for capital assets and software presently planned for are expected to be in a range between million and million with an estimated allocation of to hrs and to comdata 
we also plan to continue to grow our businesses through strategic acquisitions 
as described in the preceding discussion of financing activities in the financial condition section of this discussion  we have been opportunistically repurchasing ceridian common stock since late we repurchased  shares in and  shares in in  we plan to utilize approximately half of our free cash flow defined as operating cash flows minus capital expenditures to continue this opportunistic repurchase program 
we presently estimate that free cash flow for may be in the range of million to million 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to  additional shares of our common stock under an existing authorization from our board of directors 
we generally use our treasury stock to address our obligations under our stock compensation and employee stock purchase plans 
as of december   we have unused borrowing capacity under the million revolving credit facility amounting to million of which we have designated million as backup to the comdata receivables securitization facility 
we are in compliance with all covenants related to these facilities 
we have entered into lease and other contractual commitments that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at december   under generally accepted accounting principles 
the table below describes the annual cash payments for which we are obligated under our financing agreements  which are reported on our balance sheet  and our lease agreements and significant contractual commitments  which are not on our balance sheet  at that date 
contractual obligations at december  dollars in millions payment due by period less than more than total one year years years years long term debt and capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total see discussion at the end of this section 
table of contents our long term debt and capital lease obligations are described in the preceding comments on financing cash flows in the financial condition section of this discussion and in a note to our consolidated financial statements entitled financing 
since we have the capability and intention of continuing our use of short term borrowings under our comdata receivables securitization facility until it matures in june and our revolving credit facility until the facility matures in  the outstanding balances are treated as due on those maturity dates 
we expect that we will renew or replace these facilities when they mature 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations in leased facilities 
most of these leases contain renewal options and require payments for taxes  insurance and maintenance 
we also lease equipment for use in our businesses 
in the table above  we include our on balance sheet capital lease obligations with our debt payments and our off balance sheet operating lease commitments as lease payments 
in march  we entered into an agreement with ultimate that provided us with a non exclusive license to use ultimate s software as part of a web enabled integrated payroll hr self service offering to our small business customers 
our initial payment to ultimate amounted to million  which provided us with a non exclusive license to use its software product in our product offerings 
this payment was partially refundable pending successful transfer of the technology 
amendments to the license agreement in august and february eliminated any refundable nature of the initial payment and deemed the technology transfer complete as of february in february  we additionally agreed to pay ultimate million if an upgraded release were to be delivered prior to august   which did occur 
the million is accounted for as purchased software under sop and amortized on a straight line basis over a seven year period that began in march when our sourceweb software product incorporating this ultimate software was placed in service 
pursuant to the february amendment  the license agreement also provided for a monthly royalty commencing in january  which is based on the number of our customers employees paid by using the software and subject to minimum and maximum amounts 
pursuant to the february amendment  we made an advance payment of million to ultimate at that time representing the minimum royalty commitment for we remain obligated to future minimum monthly payments of million per month from january until january   when the per employee monthly charge will escalate at a rate of per annum until the end of the noncancellable term in march we recorded the million payment as prepaid expense and amortized this amount to cost of revenue on a straight line basis over the months of royalty costs under this agreement will be charged monthly to cost of revenue and paid according to the terms of the agreement 
in connection with the acquisition of certain call center assets in december  we entered into royalty and services arrangements that are noncancelable for the first months 
under these arrangements  we are obligated to make minimum payments of million in each of and with regard to other long term obligations  we report on our accompanying balance sheet as of december  a liability for employee benefit plans of million 
this liability includes a minimum pension benefit obligation of million and employee benefit plan obligations of million 
during  we reduced the minimum pension benefit obligation for our principal pension plan by making employer contributions of million 
we do not presently plan to make additional contributions to the principal pension plan in subsequent developments in investment performance  interest rates or regulatory actions may require a reconsideration of this position 
annual contributions to our supplemental us pension plan and the curtailed ceridian centrefile plan are not expected to exceed million in expected future payments toward our postretirement and post employment benefit obligations of million at december  are more difficult to assess 
we expect that employer contributions toward these obligations for will be million 
with the prospective effects of assumed increased health care costs and the offsetting benefit provided by the medicare act medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of as described in a note to the consolidated financial 
table of contents statement entitled retirement plans  we do not believe that we can make a reliable estimate of future employer payments toward these obligations at this time 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include the assignment of fair values upon acquisition of goodwill and other intangible assets and testing for impairment  the capitalization  amortization and impairment testing of software and development costs  the determination of our liability for pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
we use historical experience  qualified independent consultants and all available information to make these judgments and estimates  and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  we believe that our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements and related notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our company 
further discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with our business can be found in the section of this discussion entitled cautionary factors that could affect future results and part ii  item a of this report 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note a  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide our shareholders with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
assignment of fair values upon acquisition of goodwill and other intangible assets and testing for impairment 
in  we adopted new standards of accounting for business combinations fas and for goodwill and intangible assets fas 
we discuss the effect of the adoption of these standards in the section entitled goodwill and other intangibles in note a 
in the event of a business combination where we are the acquiring party  we are required to assign fair values to all identifiable assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets such as customer lists  trademarks  technology and covenants not to compete 
we are also required to determine the useful life for amortizable assets acquired 
these determinations require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and  when material amounts are involved  we generally utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants 
the remainder of the purchase cost of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets or liabilities is then recorded as goodwill 
although goodwill is no longer subject to amortization after january   the carrying value is subject to periodic review  at least annually  for impairment of that value 
we reassess the carrying value of goodwill annually  or more frequently when certain developments occur  using a discounted cash flow model dcf model to determine the current fair value of the business 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  and working capital changes 
we consider historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of our businesses are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 
we also test long lived assets  including other intangible assets  under the guidance of fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in 
table of contents circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that might indicate an impairment of carrying value include a significant decrease in the market value of the asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset or asset group is used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset or asset group a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group 
when the need for such a test is indicated  we consider such factors as whether the amortization of the carrying values for these assets for each operating unit can be recovered through forecasted undiscounted cash flows over their remaining economic life 
capitalization  amortization and impairment testing of software and development costs our software and development efforts are substantially for internal use and  as indicated in note a  accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled software and development costs  of note a  accounting policies  we rely on sop for accounting guidance 
therefore  for our modification or development efforts  we need to identify by nature and by stage of development those costs which are to be capitalized rather than charged to operations as incurred 
we also need to identify the point at which the modified or developed software is ready for use  capitalization of cost will cease and amortization of that cost will begin 
costs incurred subsequent to the ready for use date will generally be charged to operations and only capitalized if justified as a material improvement in the functionality of the capitalized software product 
with regard to the recoverability of capitalized software and development costs  we regularly perform an assessment of our ability to recover the costs invested in these assets 
the net amount of these costs shown on our consolidated balance sheet at december  was million 
the elements of software and development costs were purchased software of million and internally developed software of million 
these amounts represent the costs we have invested in these assets  reduced by amortization expense charged against our earnings as the software was used in our operations and by any write downs as a result of our recoverability analysis 
our recoverability analysis considers projected future cash flows from the utilization of the underlying software 
our projections of future cash flows are affected by such factors as technological change  competitive offerings  marketplace expectations and project development 
changes in any of these factors may result in future write downs of the carrying value of these assets 
the amount of the write down  if any  is largely dependent on our estimates of future cash flows and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
as a result of software recoverability testing during the past three years  we recorded no asset write down losses in  million in and million in determination of our liability for pensions and other postretirement benefits we present information about our pension and postretirement benefit plans in note h  retirement plans to our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits are accomplished with the assistance of independent actuaries using actuarial methodologies and incorporating significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets  and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age  and mortality 
the rate used 
table of contents to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan 
the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of of is approximately million and a change of million to pre tax earnings in the following year 
the long term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five year average market value of assets 
a change in the assumption for the long term rate of return on plan assets of of would impact pre tax earnings by approximately million for tax matters as a company with operations in many states in the us as well as in the united kingdom and canada  we record an estimated liability and expense for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the amount recorded 
cautionary factors that could affect future results in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities reform act of  we present the cautionary statements set forth below  identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements made by us 
you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below and in this report are not the only ones we will face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our businesses 
if any of the risks and uncertainties develops into actual events  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected 
if that happens  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain customers 
customer retention is an important factor in the amount and predictability of revenue and profits in each of our businesses 
our ability to retain our customers depends on a number of factors  including customer satisfaction product and service offerings by competitors customer service levels price customer viability in providing some of our solutions and services  particularly at our hrs business  we incur installation and conversion costs in connection with new customers that will need to be recovered before the contractual relationship will provide incremental profit 
longer customer relationships are likely to be more profitable 
changes in governmental regulations relating to employee benefits  taxes  funds transfer and other matters may negatively impact our revenue and earnings 
changes in or the elimination of governmental regulations may adversely affect our revenue and earnings and the way we conduct our businesses 
changes in governmental regulations are difficult to predict and could be significant 
for example  the extent and type of benefits that employers are required to or may choose to provide employees and the amount and type of federal or state taxes employers and employees are required to pay will affect the associated new products or services that we may sell 
as 
table of contents another example  comdata is currently licensed on the state level by the banking or financial institutions departments of numerous states 
continued licensing by these states is subject to ongoing satisfaction of compliance requirements regarding safety and soundness  including  for example  posting of surety bonds to guarantee payment of funds in transit 
changes in this regulatory environment  including the implementation of new or varying measures by the us federal government  may significantly affect or change the manner in which comdata currently conducts some of the aspects of its business 
our future revenue growth will depend on our ability to continue selling our products and services to our existing customers  introducing new or enhanced products and services  attracting and retaining new customers and selling additional products and services to existing customers 
we expect that a portion of our anticipated future revenue growth in each of our business segments will be derived from the continued selling of products and services to our existing customers the introduction of new or enhanced products and services in our businesses the selling of products and services to new customers the selling of additional products and services to our existing customers how successful we will be in these efforts will depend on a variety of factors  including the quality and perceived value of our product and service offerings effective sales and marketing efforts our ability to attract new and retain new and existing customers the level of market acceptance and the avoidance of difficulties or delays in development or introduction of new products and services our ability to integrate technology and information systems into our products and services our successful implementation of products and services for new and existing customers there can be no assurance that we will achieve our revenue growth objectives from our cross selling efforts and selling of new products and services 
the inability to cross sell our products and services  attract and retain new customers or successfully develop and implement new and enhanced products and services could harm our businesses 
economic factors may harm our business and operating results 
trade  monetary and fiscal policies  and political and economic conditions may substantially change  with corresponding impacts on the industries that we serve  particularly those more economically sensitive industries such as trucking and retail 
approximately percent of comdata s revenue for was attributable to its transportation business 
comdata s results of operations are  therefore  dependent on the level of activity in the transportation industry  which  in turn  is affected by general economic conditions 
for example  a decrease in the number of truck drivers would decrease the number of comchek transactions and could adversely affect comdata s revenues 
similarly  since a significant portion of our fueling transactions are priced by reference to the amount spent on the transaction  our revenue can be significantly affected by changes in diesel fuel prices 
falling diesel fuel prices directly reduce the amounts of revenue and earnings related to these transactions 
rising diesel fuel prices increase our revenue and earnings but also increase the working capital requirements of comdata and subject comdata to greater credit or bad debt risks with respect to its customers that purchase diesel fuel using a comdata payment method 
changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  and political and economic conditions could also affect employment levels  with a corresponding impact on our payroll processing and tax filing businesses 

table of contents decreased employment levels  as well as slowed economic conditions  could negatively affect wage and bonus payments  orders and the timing of product installations  and negatively impact the operating results of our hrs business 
litigation and governmental investigations may harm our financial results 
our future operating results may be harmed by adverse judgments  settlements  unanticipated costs or other effects of legal and administrative proceedings now pending or that may be instituted in the future  or from investigations by administrative agencies 
we are currently responding to a document request from the securities and exchange commission  and we have been advised that the sec has issued a formal order of investigation 
we are fully cooperating with the sec on its investigation 
although we believe that our accounting is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we cannot predict the outcome of the sec s investigation or when the investigation will be resolved 
an adverse outcome of this investigation could have a material adverse effect on us and result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings  sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties  the restatement of our financial results for the years under review  stockholder lawsuits  and increased review and scrutiny of us by regulatory authorities  the media and others 
in addition  we are restating our financial results for the fiscal years ended december    and to reflect a change in accounting relating to the revenue recognition policy of comdata s stored value systems unit 
the restatement could result in litigation and the judgment  settlement and costs of such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
any problems or delays we may experience in implementing system upgrades and conversions could harm our business 
we expect to continue our efforts to transition to new or enhanced data processing systems and or software in several of our business units  including systems that process customer data and internal management information systems which provide enhanced data and information services 
the successful implementation of these new or enhanced systems will be critical to the effective delivery of products and services and the efficient operation of our businesses 
problems or delays with the installation or initial operation of new or enhanced systems could disrupt or increase costs in connection with our delivery of services and with our operations planning  financial reporting and management 
from time to time  we have experienced these types of problems or delays 
our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to adapt to changing technology 
as a provider of information management and data processing services  we will need to adapt and respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the technological requirements of our customers  including those related to the internet  in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position 
for example  management is implementing a strategy for our hrs business to provide services over the internet 
as another example  comdata s credit  debit and cash cards could be replaced by a next generation payment method 
there can be no assurance that we will develop and release new products and services or product and service enhancements within the required time frames and within targeted costs 
significant delays  difficulties or added costs in introducing new products and services or enhancements  either through internal development  acquisitions or cooperative relationships with other companies  could adversely affect the market acceptance of our products and services and our operating results 

table of contents our strategy to make acquisitions of and investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies involves risks that could harm our business and operating results 
one of our growth strategies is to make acquisitions of and investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies that will enable us to add products and services for our core customer base and for adjacent markets  and to expand each of our businesses geographically 
our ability to make these acquisitions and investments will depend on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates and investments at acceptable costs our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and investments the availability of capital to complete these acquisitions and investments these risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions or investments within a relatively short period of time 
the benefits of an acquisition or investment may often take considerable time to develop  and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment will in fact produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated 
in addition  implementation of this strategy entails a number of risks  including inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies and cost savings reallocation of significant amounts of capital from operating initiatives to acquisitions increase in our indebtedness and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed in addition  some acquisitions and investments may require the consent of the lenders under our million revolving credit facility  and we cannot predict whether approvals would be forthcoming or the terms on which the lenders would approve these transactions 
also  from an accounting perspective  acquisitions and investments may involve non recurring charges and significant charges from periodic reassessments of the recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from acquisitions that could harm our operating results 
our million revolving credit and comdata receivables securitization facilities may restrict our operating flexibility 
the governing documents for our million revolving credit and comdata receivables securitization facilities contain a number of significant provisions that  among other things  restrict our ability to sell assets incur more indebtedness grant or incur liens on our assets make investments or acquisitions enter into leases or assume contingent obligations engage in mergers or consolidations engage in transactions with our affiliates 
table of contents these restrictions could hurt our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or make acquisitions that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our credit facilities require that we satisfy several financial covenants 
our ability to comply with these financial requirements and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control  and our inability to comply with them could result in a default under a credit facility 
if a default occurs under one of our credit facilities  the lenders under the other facility could elect to declare all of the outstanding borrowings  as well as accrued interest and fees  to be due and payable and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay those borrowings 
in addition  a default may result in higher rates of interest and the inability to obtain additional capital 
the markets we serve may attract new competitors or cause current competitors to focus more on these markets  which could harm our business 
new competitors could decide to enter the markets we serve or current competitors could decide to focus more on these markets  and thereby intensify the highly competitive conditions that already exist 
these new entrants and existing competitors could offer or introduce new technologies or a different service model  or could treat the services to be provided by one of our businesses as one component of a larger product or service offering 
these developments could enable these new and existing competitors to offer similar products or services at reduced prices 
any of these or similar developments could harm our business and results of operations 
we will be subject to risks related to our international operations  which may harm our operating results 
approximately percent of hrs revenue was obtained from customers outside of the united states 
our ceridian centrefile subsidiary provides human resource services  payroll processing services and human resource information systems software in the united kingdom

government regulation changes on timing or amount of remittances and changes in interest rates may reduce our investment income from customer deposits 
our payroll and tax filing business in the united states and canada has historically derived significant revenue and earnings from the investment of customer deposits  and these revenue and earnings are an integral part of our payroll and tax filing business 
changes in governmental regulations on the timing and amount of remittances may reduce the period of time we are allowed to hold these remittances  as well as the amount of such remittances  and may decrease our revenue and earnings from this source 
if governmental regulations change in this fashion  we would likely seek to require customers who permit us to retain earnings on their deposits to pay us additional fees in lieu of a portion of this lost investment income 
in addition  changes in interest rates will affect our revenue and earnings from this source 
interest rate changes are difficult to predict and could be significant 
we expect to continue to lessen the impact of interest rate decreases by the use of derivative securities such as interest rate contract transactions that are described in more detail in a note to our consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies and under part ii  item a of this report 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to use derivative securities such as collars and swaps or obtain them on favorable terms  or to what extent any decrease in investment income would be offset by the use of these derivative securities 
if we were unable to secure derivative securities on favorable terms and interest rates decrease  our financial results would be harmed

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposure is primarily due to the variability of interest income earned on the investment of customer funds in lieu of fees and reported as revenue 
due to the short term nature of customers obligations paid by funds in our possession  investments of these funds must have very short maturities 
this exposes our interest revenue from customer funds to changes in short term interest rates which are highly volatile 
our objective in managing interest revenue is to provide a stable and predictable 
table of contents source of such revenue 
to achieve this objective we coordinate a risk management program of investing in longer term assets  issuing floating rate debt  and purchasing interest rate derivative securities eg collars  swaps that have the effect of converting variable short term rates into fixed long term rates 
by converting the short term interest rate exposure to fixed rates  or offsetting short term interest earned with short term interest payments on debt  we achieve a high degree of stability and predictability of net interest income 
the fair value of our interest rate derivative securities was million at december  and million at december  the table below illustrates the hypothetical change in our after tax investment income  net of interest expense over a one year period due to an immediate and sustained change in interest rates from the assumed base case of federal funds rate at december  percent change in interest rates hypothetical change in net interest expressed in basis points income from base scenario in millions of dollars rise rise rise rise rise base scenario decline decline decline computations in the table above are based on assumed levels of customer funds  floating rate debt  and us and canadian interest rates 
this table should not be relied on as precise indicators of future expected results 
the computations reflect the expected changes in interest revenue and interest income including the impact of derivative securities  net of interest expense on a consolidated basis 
derivative securities that will be in effect for will cover an average of million of short term investment balances of customer funds  with a combined average floor of and cap of 
maturities of existing contracts extend to december of we actively monitor and control our overall interest rate risk exposure such that over the year income from net assets exposed to changes in interest rates remains fairly constant 
during our net assets exposed to short term assets increased million due to increased customer assets  adding  after tax per basis points of sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
we currently anticipate generally rising interest rates in the us and stable to falling interest rates in canada 
we also intend to obtain additional interest rate derivative securities when market conditions are favorable to replace maturing interest rate contracts 
we have no forward interest rate contracts starting effectiveness for periods beginning after we refer you to note k  commitments and contingencies  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivative securities 
other secondary market risk exposures we face include fuel price risk and foreign exchange risk 
our comdata transportation services business revenue and net income is exposed to variability based on changes in the prices of diesel fuel 
for a large portion of its transportation services customers  comdata earns fee revenue for card transactions based on a percentage of the total amount of each fuel purchase 
an increase decrease in the price of diesel fuel increases decreases the total dollar amount of fuel purchases and comdata revenue  accordingly 
we estimate that for each 
change in the average price of diesel fuel per year  comdata revenue and pretax profit are impacted by million  before impact of any fuel price hedging program 

table of contents our risk management objective of managing fuel price risk is to protect comdata revenue and net income from the effects of falling diesel fuel prices by entering into derivative contracts that convert the floating price of fuel used in revenue calculations to a fixed price 
in providing services to certain of our trucking customers  comdata calculates a portion of the fees it charges as a fixed percentage of the total cost of fuel purchased 
as fuel prices rise and fall  comdata s revenue rises and falls accordingly 
during  comdata entered into fuel price derivative contracts to swap the floating price of fuel for a fixed price 
these contracts had the effect of reducing the exposure to price variability of diesel fuel noted above by approximately one half for the period april to december  in march  comdata entered into similar fuel price derivative contracts at an average fixed price of per gallon from june  through december  we continuously monitor fuel price volatility and the cost of hedging and may enter into additional fuel price derivative contracts solely for the purpose of managing fuel price risk when market conditions are favorable to such transactions 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to our hrs operations at ceridian canada and ceridian centrefile  and is not considered material to our financial condition or results of operations 
these foreign operations principally serve their respective domestic markets with nearly all revenues and expenses denominated in local currency 
other intercompany charges between us and us based operations are not material 
translation adjustments on investments in foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive income in our accompanying statements of stockholders equity and are not hedged
