item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this document 
overview we focus on developing and commercializing first to market biopharmaceuticals to improve the lives of people living with life threatening diseases or serious medical conditions 
we select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent both a significant medical need and also have well understood biology 
our first product  aldurazyme  has been approved for marketing in the us by the fda  in the eu by the emea and other countries for the treatment of mps i disease 
we have developed aldurazyme through a joint venture with genzyme corporation genzyme 
we are developing aryplase for the treatment of mps vi  phenoptin for the treatment of moderate to mild forms of pku and vibrilase for use in the debridement of serious burns in preparation for skin grafting or other therapy 
in september  we announced that we halted our phase a study of neutralase for the reversal of anticoagulation by heparin in primary cabg surgery and that we have terminated the neutralase program for all indications 
our net loss in was million as compared to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a one time  million milestone payment received from genzyme in also  in we recorded an million in process research and development expense related to the acquisition of synapse technologies inc without these items  our net loss would have increased by million in compared to the principal reason was increased research and development expense related to the aryplase and neutralase clinical trials and manufacturing 
during  we raised million from a public offering of our common stock and million from a convertible debt offering 
as of december   our combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
our cash burn in was million as compared to million in the million increase in cash burn  a non gaap financial measure  is primarily attributable to the increase in research and development activities discussed above  partially offset by the million milestone payment received from genzyme in may see liquidity and capital resources non gaap financial measure below for discussion of cash burn as a non gaap financial measure and the reconciliation of cash burn to net increase decrease in cash 
with the commercial launch of aldurazyme during the second quarter of  we changed our presentation of the results of operations of the aldurazyme joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
previously  we recorded revenue to the extent that the services performed by us on behalf of the joint venture were funded by genzyme 
costs incurred by us on behalf of the joint venture were recorded as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc previously represented of the joint venture net loss that related to costs incurred by genzyme 
in our new presentation  the equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc represents our share of the joint venture s net loss 
costs incurred by us on behalf of the joint venture are included in the financial statements of the joint venture and are not directly reflected in our operating expenses 
this change had no effect on our loss from operations or net loss for all periods presented 
both the prior presentation and the new presentation are acceptable under the equity method of accounting 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this change 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for our equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc  long lived assets  income taxes  research and development expenses and inventory  and stock option plans have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc we account for our joint venture investment using the equity method 
accordingly  we record an increase in our investment for contributions to the joint venture  and a reduction in our investment for our share of the loss of the joint venture 
equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s loss for the period 
the investment in and advances to biomarin genzyme llc also includes the current receivable from the joint venture for the reimbursement related to services provided to the joint venture by us 
see notes b and c to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our change in presentation of the joint venture results of operations and the critical accounting policies of the joint venture 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
the estimation of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with long lived assets requires judgment and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual results 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  the principal amount of which is the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards  of approximately million at december  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
research and development and inventory costs research and development expenses include expenses associated with contract research and development provided by third parties  product manufacturing prior to regulatory approval  clinical and regulatory costs  and internal research and development costs 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
inventory costs for product candidates are expensed until regulatory approval is obtained  at which time inventory is capitalized at the lower of cost or market value 
stock option plans we have three stock based compensation plans 
we account for those plans under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees whereby generally no stock based compensation cost is reflected in our net loss for options issued to employees and directors with exercise prices at or above the market price on the date of issuance 
we recognize as an expense the fair value of options granted to persons who are neither employees nor directors 
recent accounting pronouncements see note o of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect that any of these recent pronouncements will have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations all of the activities related to the manufacture  distribution and sale of aldurazyme are reported in the results of the joint venture 
because of this change  we have divided our discussion of the results of operations into two sections  biomarin in total and biomarin genzyme llc 
the discussion of the joint venture s operations includes the total amounts for the joint venture  not just our interest in the operations 
biomarin net loss our net loss in as compared to decreased from million to million 
the decrease was primarily the result of a one time  million milestone payment received from genzyme in and an million in process research and development expense in related to the acquisition of synapse technologies inc without these items  our net loss would have increased by million in as a result of an increase in research and development expenses in of million  primarily related to aryplase and neutralase for which research and development expense increased by million and million  respectively in compared to our net loss in as compared to increased from million to million 
the increase was primarily the result of fixed asset write offs and a lease commitment accrual of million  increased neutralase development costs of million and corporate expansion costs of million 
the increase in the equity in the loss of the biomarin genzyme llc of million represents increased aldurazyme manufacturing 
in  we recorded a loss from the disposal of a discontinued operation of million 
milestone revenue milestone revenue in represents the million milestone payment received from genzyme related to the fda marketing approval of aldurazyme 
milestone revenue is typically not recurring in nature and we do not expect to earn additional milestone revenue in the foreseeable future 
research and development expense our research and development expenses include personnel  facility and external costs associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
these development costs primarily include preclinical and clinical studies  manufacturing prior to regulatory approval  quality control and assurance and other product development expenses such as regulatory and intellectual property costs 
research and development expenses in increased by million to million from million in the major factors causing the increase include increased aryplase activities including manufacturing and quality control costs of million and phase clinical trial costs of million 
increased neutralase phase a clinical trial costs of million and contract manufacturing costs of million in also contributed to the increase 
we expect research and development expense to decrease in as a result of terminating the development of neutralase during research and development expenses in increased by million to million from million in the major factors causing the increase include million for increased contract manufacturing costs for neutralase and million for increased research staff to support our product programs 
general and administrative expense our general and administrative expenses include administrative personnel  facility and external costs required to support our product development programs 
these general and administrative costs include facility operating expenses and depreciation  human resources and finance personnel costs and other corporate costs such as insurance and legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in included in are the asset write offs and lease commitment accrual related to the abandonment of a facility totaling million and legal and other fees associated with the acquisition of glyko biomedical ltd 
of million 
general and administrative expenses in decreased due to the reversal of the million lease liability associated with our decision to develop the previously abandoned facility 
after adjusting for these charges  the primary factors causing the increase in general and administrative expenses for include increased consulting expense of million  personnel costs of million  insurance expense of million and other corporate cost increases 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase in as a result of the reduction of general and administrative expense resulting from the lease liability  which will not recur in  and due to increased facility costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in the significant factors causing the increase include asset write offs and the lease commitment accrual related to the decision to abandon a facility totaling million  additional legal and other fees associated with our acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of glyko biomedical ltd 
of million  increased staffing in finance  purchasing  business development and human resources of million  increased legal and consulting expenses of million  expenses relating to the implementation of an improved financial reporting and budgeting software system of million and an increase in rent expense of million 
in process research and development in process research and development expense of million in represents the purchase price of all of the outstanding stock of synapse technologies  inc synapse in march plus related expenses 
we purchased synapse for million of our common stock  shares 
in connection with the synapse purchase  we issued options and warrants to purchase  and  shares of our common stock  respectively 
these options and warrants were valued using the black scholes option pricing model and the resulting  and  respectively  was included as additional purchase price 
the purchase agreement includes our agreement to pay up to cdn 
million which equaled approximately us million as of december  in contingency payments upon achievement of certain regulatory and licensing milestones if they occur before march   payable in our common stock or cash at our discretion 
in process research and development in represents the purchase price of our acquisition of the ibex therapeutic assets in october plus related expenses totaling million 
we purchased from ibex technologies inc and its subsidiaries the development activities associated with the ibex therapeutic enzyme drug products including neutralase and phenylase 
the purchase agreement called for a total purchase price of million  consisting of million in cash and million of common stock 
in connection with the transaction  we issued options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
these options were valued using the black scholes option pricing model and the resulting million was included as additional purchase price 
the purchase agreement includes up to approximately cdn 
million which equaled approximately us million as of december  in contingency payments upon regulatory approval of neutralase and phenylase  provided that approval occurs prior to october  because of the termination of the neutralase program  we do not expect to incur the neutralase contingency payment of cdn 
million which equaled approximately us million as of december  equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s loss for the period 
the investment in and advances to biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s cash  accounts receivable and inventory  and it also includes the current receivable from the joint venture for the reimbursement related to services provided to the joint venture by us 
equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc was million in compared to million in the decrease is principally due to aldurazyme sales during and the capitalization of inventory production costs upon the regulatory approval of aldurazyme  partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs associated with the commercialization of aldurazyme 
equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc was million in compared to million in the increase is due to increased pre commercial manufacturing activities  including increased facility costs such as depreciation of the plant expansion completed in  increased costs to support the phase and phase extension studies of million  increased expenses related to the filing of the biologics license application with the fda and the filing of the marketing authorization application in europe and an increased level of marketing expenses in preparation for the commercial launch of aldurazyme  partially offset by decreased clinical activities of million and a reduction in process development activities of million 
interest income we invest our cash and short term investments in government and other high credit quality securities in order to limit default and market risk 
despite a significant increase in our cash and short term investments during  interest income did not increase proportionately as a result of the decrease in available market rates 
interest income increased to million in from million in primarily due to increased levels of cash and investments obtained through the common stock and convertible debt offerings completed during interest income increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher cash balances maintained throughout from financing activities completed during interest expense we incur interest expense on our convertible debt issued in june and on our equipment loans 
interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in is due to interest expense on the convertible debt 
we expect interest expense to increase in because we anticipate that the convertible debt will be outstanding for the entire year compared to six months during interest expense was million and  in and  respectively 
the increase is due to equipment loans of million and million executed during and during the month of december  respectively 
discontinued operations in december  we decided to close the carbohydrate analytical business portion of our wholly owned subsidiary  glyko  inc glyko 
as a result  the operations of glyko are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we have segregated its operating results in our consolidated statements of operations and have segregated its cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in january  we sold certain assets of glyko to a third party for a total sales price of up to million 
the sales price was comprised of cash totaling million  a note receivable payable in quarterly installments through totaling million and quarterly royalties based upon future sales of certain glyko products through up to a maximum of million 
the proceeds from the sale of the glyko assets  including the discounted note receivable of million  was recorded as a gain from discontinued operations in the first quarter of totaling million  net of transaction costs 
the royalties are recorded as earned 
income from discontinued operations in and represents net receipts from glyko subsequent to our decision to discontinue this business 
the increase to income in was due to an increase in sales to customers in anticipation of the sale or discontinuance of the analytics business of glyko 
gain from disposal of discontinued operations in of million represents proceeds from the sale of glyko assets discussed above 
the loss from disposal of discontinued operations in of million represents the glyko closure expense subsequent to our decision to discontinue this business 
loss from disposal of discontinued operations in represents the glyko closure expense of million consisting primarily of an impairment reserve against the unamortized balance of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the initial acquisition of glyko 
biomarin genzyme llc the discussion below gives effect to the inventory capitalization policy that we use for inventory held by the joint venture  which is different from the joint venture s inventory capitalization policy 
we began capitalizing aldurazyme inventory production costs in may after us regulatory approval was obtained 
the joint venture began capitalizing aldurazyme inventory production costs in january when inventory production for commercial sale began 
the difference in inventory capitalization policies results in a greater operating expense realized by us prior to regulatory approval  and lower cost of goods sold with higher gross profit realized by us as the previously expensed product is sold by the joint venture  as well as lower research and development expense when aldurazyme is used in on going clinical trials 
these adjustments will be eliminated when all of the product produced prior to regulatory approval has been sold or used in clinical trials 
see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the difference in inventory cost basis between us and the joint venture 
revenue and gross profit we and our joint venture partner  genzyme  received marketing approval for aldurazyme in the us on april   and in the us on june  we have subsequently received marketing approval in other countries 
aldurazyme was launched commercially in may in the us and in june in the eu the joint venture recognized million of revenue and million of gross profit during gross profit for would have been higher by million if not for production costs incurred during the third quarter of that were not allocated to aldurazyme inventory 
biomarin genzyme llc recognized million of revenue during  representing pre approval sales on a named patient basis allowable in certain countries outside of the us operating expenses operating expenses of the joint venture include the costs associated with the development and commercialization of aldurazyme and totaled million for as compared to million for operating expenses in included million of sales and marketing expenses associated with the commercial launch of aldurazyme and million of research and development costs 
research and development of the joint venture for included million for the production of aldurazyme prior to obtaining regulatory approval and million of clinical trial costs and continued research and development efforts 
operating expenses in included million of sales and marketing expenses related to the commercialization of aldurazyme and million of research and development 
research and development decreased in compared to due to the capitalization of inventory in may after regulatory approval was obtained 
sales and marketing expenses increased in due to increased commercialization activities in support of the aldurazyme commercial launch 
operating expenses of the joint venture totaled million in and included million of research and development costs  primarily related to the manufacturing of aldurazyme prior to approval and clinical trials  and million of sales and marketing expenses 
research and development expense increased in compared to due primarily to increased manufacturing in sales and marketing increased in compared to due to increased commercialization activities 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow we have financed our operations by the issuance of common stock  convertible debt  equipment financing and the related interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
during  we raised million from a public offering of our common stock  million from the sale of our common stock to acqua wellington and million from a convertible debt offering 
we voluntarily elected to terminate our equity financing agreement with acqua wellington in september as of december   our combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  an increase of million from million at december  the primary sources of cash during were the financing activities described above  a milestone payment from genzyme of million and the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options under our stock compensation plans of approximately million 
the primary uses of cash during the year ended december  were to finance operations and fund the joint venture with genzyme 
our cash burn in was million as compared to million in the million increase in cash burn  a non gaap financial measure  is primarily attributable to the increased research and development activities and increased investment in the joint venture discussed above  offset by the million milestone payment received from genzyme in may see non gaap financial measure below for discussion of cash burn as a non gaap financial measure and the reconciliation of cash burn to net increase decrease in cash 
we do not expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future because we expect to continue to incur operational expenses and continue our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  process development  including quality systems for product manufacture  regulatory processes in the us and international jurisdictions  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  and expansion of sales and marketing activities 
we also expect to incur costs related to increased marketing and manufacturing of aldurazyme to satisfy the product demands associated with its commercial launch 
funding commitments we expect to fund our operations with our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and supplement our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments through proceeds from equity or debt financing  loans or collaborative agreements with corporate partners 
we expect our current funds  including the proceeds from our public offering  convertible debt offering and the milestone payment from genzyme  to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the end of our investment in our product development programs has a major impact on our operating performance 
in the year ended december   our research and development expense of million represents million of aryplase costs  million of neutralase costs  million of vibrilase costs and million of research and development costs not allocated to specific major projects 
in the year ended december   our research and development expense of million represents million of aryplase costs  million of vibrilase costs and million of research and development costs not allocated to specific major projects 
in the year ended december   our research and development expense of million represents million of aryplase costs  million of vibrilase costs  million of neutralase costs and million of research and development costs not allocated to specific major projects 
we expect that the proceeds from equity or debt financing  loans or collaborative agreements will be used to fund future operating costs  capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which may include costs associated with the commercialization of our products  additional clinical trials and the manufacturing of aryplase  preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates  potential licenses and other acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies  general corporate purposes including the development of our corporate facilities  and working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to our ability to successfully commercialize aldurazyme  the progress  timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes  including quality systems and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities  the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments  any changes made to or new developments in our existing collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish  and whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future borrowings and contractual obligations our million of convertible notes will impact our liquidity due to the semi annual cash interest payments and the scheduled repayment of the notes in should we redeem the notes after june  at our option according to the terms of the notes  we will be subject to premiums upon redemption ranging from to  dependent upon the time the notes are redeemed 
we also must repay the debt if there is a qualifying change in control or termination of trading of our common stock 
we have entered into several agreements for loans secured by certain equipment with an aggregate outstanding balance totaling million at december  the loans bear interest ranging from to and are secured by certain manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
additionally  the agreements have covenants that require us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of million 
should the unrestricted cash balance fall below million  we can either provide the lender with an irrevocable letter of credit for the amount of the total loans outstanding or repay the loans with prepayment penalties 
we expect to enter into similar facilities as we acquire additional equipment  expand our operations and develop our corporate facilities 
we anticipate a need for additional financing to fund our future operations  including the commercialization of our drug product candidates currently under development 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be obtained or  if obtained  will be available on reasonable terms or in a timely manner 
however  we expect that financing collateralized by our tangible assets at risk adjusted market interest rates will be available from a financial institution 
we have contractual and commercial obligations under our debt  operating and capital leases and other obligations related to research and development activities  licenses and sales royalties with annual minimums 
information about these obligations as of december   is presented in the table below in thousands 
payments due by period total thereafter convertible debt and related interest operating leases equipment loans and capital leases research and development and license obligations total we have also licensed technology  for which we are required to pay royalties upon future sales  subject to certain annual minimums 
as of december   such minimum annual commitments are approximately  we are also subject to contingent payments totaling approximately million upon achievement of certain regulatory and licensing milestones if they occur before certain dates in the future  which includes million related to neutralase  for which we terminated development during and  accordingly  we do not expect they will ever be payable 
non gaap financial measure the discussion above includes cash burn a non gaap financial measure 
we define cash burn as the net increase or decrease in cash excluding the effect of capital markets financing activities and the purchase and sale of short term investments each as determined in accordance with gaap 
cash burn for of million is equal to the net increase in cash in compared to of million plus net purchases of short term investments in of million  minus capital market financings in of million 
cash burn for of million is equal to the net increase in cash in compared to of million less net sales of short term investments in of million  as there were no capital market financings during we use short term investments as an investment vehicle for our cash and cash equivalents  and the distinction between cash and cash equivalents is determined based on the duration of the investment 
we manage our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as a common pool 
the effect on net increase or decrease in cash because of the purchase and sale of short term investments is impossible to predict and does not have a material effect on our liquidity or total current assets since short term investments are usually bonds and notes held to maturity 
therefore  for purposes of determining cash burn  we do not give effect to the purchase and sale of short term investments and assume that the net effect of the purchase and sale of short term investments will be zero 
we believe that cash burn  although a non gaap financial measure  provides useful information to investors by showing the net cash expended in most aspects of our activities 
we also believe that the presentation of this non gaap financial measure is consistent with our past practice  as well as industry practice in general  and will enable investors  analysts and readers of our financial statements to compare current non gaap measures with non gaap measures presented in prior periods 
any non gaap financial measure used by us should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
related party transactions in  we loaned our chief executive officer  to purchase a property and received a promissory note secured by the property 
the note matures on october   and bears interest at the federal mid term rate as of december  
the balance of the note plus accrued interest at december   was approximately  in february  we loaned one of our senior vice presidents  and received a promissory note secured by his unencumbered shares of the company 
the note accrued interest at the federal short term rate and was repaid during in march  we entered into an employment agreement with one of our senior vice presidents that entitles him to loans from the company of up to  to be applied to the purchase of a home or up to  annually if a purchase of a home is not completed 
the loans bear interest and are due upon his termination of employment with us 
as of december   there was approximately  outstanding under the loan arrangement with annual interest rates of to 
during  certain consulting services were rendered by one of our directors 
the director was paid  in  and  in january  for those services 
one of our senior vice presidents holds an adjunct faculty position with harbor ucla research educational institute rei for purposes of conducting research 
rei licenses certain intellectual property and provides other research services to us 
we are also obligated to pay rei royalties on future sales of products covered by the license agreement 
minimum annual royalties payable to rei are  we paid rei approximately million and million in and  respectively  primarily for research 
our joint venture with genzyme is subject to a second agreement with rei that requires the joint venture to pay rei a royalty on sales of products covered by the license agreement through november  of which our senior vice president is entitled to certain portions  based on the sales level per the terms of the agreement 
the license agreement was effective before the senior vice president was a biomarin officer 
pursuant to these agreements  our senior vice president was entitled to approximately  during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and  therefore  our investment portfolio is not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates at december   we believe that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately million  respectively  in the fair value of the investment portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio  however  we will not recognize such gains or losses unless the investments are sold 
the table below presents the carrying value of our cash and investment portfolio  which approximates fair value at december  in thousands carrying value cash and cash equivalents short term investments total of cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds  in taxable municipal debt securities and of uninvested cash 
of short term investments invested in us agency securities  in municipal debt securities  in taxable municipal debt securities  in a p rated commercial paper and in corporate bonds 
our debt obligations consist of our convertible debt  equipment based loans and capital lease obligations  which carry fixed interest rates and  as a result  we are not exposed to interest rate market risk on our debt 
the carrying value of our convertible debt and equipment loans approximates their fair value at december  foreign currency exchange rate market risk a significant portion of aldurazyme sales by biomarin genzyme llc are earned outside of the us and  therefore  our equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc is subject to risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the policies and procedures related to the management of foreign currency risk of aldurazyme sales are maintained and performed by our joint venture partner  genzyme 
based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   we do not expect that a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year
