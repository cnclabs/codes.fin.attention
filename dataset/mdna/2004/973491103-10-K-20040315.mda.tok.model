item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview the company is a self managed real estate investment trust  or reit 
the company was formed in mid on august   the company completed an initial public offering of  common shares the initial offering resulting in net proceeds after underwriters discount and offering expenses of approximately million 
the company received net proceeds of million after underwriters discounts and expenses from its december secondary offering of  common shares at a public offering price of per share 
proceeds of both the initial offering and the secondary offering were used to acquire specialty medical properties  such as medical office buildings  outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities  physician group practice clinics  ambulatory surgery centers  and specialty hospitals and treatment centers and to repay indebtedness 
the properties acquired generally are leased to healthcare providers and physicians on long term leases with annual lease rate escalations 
as of december   the company owned buildings in cities in states 
the company contributed all of the net proceeds of both offerings to its operating partnership 
as of december   the company owned an approximate interest in the operating partnership 
the operating partnership uses a mixture of cash and debt to make its acquisitions 
the company has significantly increased the size of its real estate portfolio and its rental operations throughout through the acquisition of the following properties

vernon medical office building  winn way medical office building  urology center of florida ambulatory surgery center  morningside medical office building  nashville medical office building  stone oak medical office building  tomball medical office building  west pearland medical office building  gateway medical office building  rush copley medical office building  methodist medical office building  elm street medical office building  properties acquired must meet certain criteria that include but are not limited to location  tenant quality  tenant mix  market appeal  purchase price  property condition  market trend and length of leases in place 
maintaining and increasing occupancy levels and lease renewals are critical to ongoing return on investment expected in each property 
cost of debt and the ratio of debt to equity are also critical elements that can affect the investment return 
the company believes locking in fixed rate low interest debt is its first choice 
use of variable rate debt at low interest rates is also part of the strategy  but in order to maintain compliance with loan covenants  the company must limit the amount of variable rate debt without an interest rate swap to the amount outstanding on it secured line of credit plus million 
the company also conducts service operations through hospital affiliates development corporation hadc  a wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary of the operating partnership 
the net assets and operations of the service operations acquired in connection with the initial offering were designated as the predecessor the predecessor for accounting purposes 
therefore  the company maintained carry over basis for the accounting of the purchase of these assets 
accordingly  the results of operations for the year ended december  comprise those of the combined entities of the company and the predecessor from august  through december  all periods prior to august  include only the operations of the predecessor 
the operations reported for the year ended december  were for activities that were both new contracts for services and the completion of contracts entered into by the predecessor 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon rental income from its specialty medical properties rental operations 
the following highlights the areas of rental operations that the company considers critical for future revenue growth occupancy analysis the ability to maintain occupancy rates is a principal driver of the company s results of operations 
the following table sets forth information regarding the company s in service portfolio of rental properties as of december  and square feet in thousands rentable total square feet percent occupied in service portfolio the acquisition of numerous multi tenant medical office buildings during year ended december  resulted in a change in concentration of the company s rentable square footage from master lease properties to multi tenant medical office buildings 
as of december   the company s portfolio consisted of five fully occupied master lease properties and only two multi tenant medical office buildings 
throughout  the 
table of contents company diversified the portfolio by adding fourteen multi tenant medical office buildings and one fully occupied master lease property 
due to the change in concentration of building types  the occupancy percentage decreased  but there was no actual net loss of tenants throughout the year ended december  lease expiration and renewals the company s ability to maintain and grow its occupancy rates primarily depends upon its continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects the company s in service lease expiration schedule as of december  the table indicates rentable square footage and annualized net effective rents based on december monthly rental revenue under expiring leases in thousands percentage square monthly rental of monthly year of number footage percentage of revenue of rental lease of leases of leases total expiring revenue expiration expiring expiring square feet leases expiring thereafter total during the year ended december   the company renewed seventeen leases for  square feet  lost five leases representing  square feet  and added six new leases representing  square feet 
the company does not currently expect its renewal percentage during the year ended december  to significantly differ from that experienced in the comparable period in acquisition and development activity the company seeks to acquire or to develop quality medical properties in geographic areas and or in specialities where the demand for medical services is expected to increase over the coming years 
the company also targets properties that are located on or near hospital campuses in expanding markets with high occupancy rates and competitive tenant lease terms 
the company believes that such properties  when efficiently marketed  actively managed and leased  provide attractive returns  significant cash flow growth potential and stable rents 
service operations the company recognizes contract revenues using the percentage of completion method  whereby the percentage complete is based on hours incurred in relation to total estimated hours to be incurred 
costs associated with obtaining the company contracts are expensed as incurred 
any change in the estimated total hours to be incurred on a contract could have a material impact on the company estimated contract percentage completion and as a result could have a material impact on the company net income or loss since such estimates are based upon the estimate of work to be performed on individual contracts 
during the third quarter of the company the company implemented a strategy to shift hadc s primary business purpose from traditional third party fee for service contracts to managing internally developed projects for the company 
this strategy has positioned hadc to concentrate on internally developed projects and retain sufficient staff to maintain its third party fee for service contract activities consistent with the shift in hadc s primary business purpose 
as these self developed projects begin  a large percentage of hadc s direct labor costs will be capitalized directly to the respective projects under construction 

table of contents funds from operations ffo funds from operations ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating measure of an equity real estate investments trust reit 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
the company believes that ffo is helpful in understanding the company s operating performance in that ffo excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets 
the company believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets  whose value does not diminish predictably over time  as historical cost depreciation implies 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company does 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
the following is a reconciliation between net income and ffo for the period august  through december  and year ended december  august  year ended through december  december  net income available to common shareholders add back deduct depreciation and amortization minority interest share of depreciation amortization funds from operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental operations rental income rental revenue for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenue is reflective of the property acquisitions completed in  along with the full year of ownership of the assets held at the end of there was no material change in occupancy percentage with respect to rental revenue

table of contents the year ended december  the increase in rental expenses are reflective of the acquisitions completed in  along with the full year of ownership of the assets held at the end of there was no material change in the level of rental expenses for properties held in both and real estate tax expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in rental expenses are reflective of the acquisitions completed in  along with the full year of ownership of the assets held at the end of there was no material change in the level of real estate tax expenses for properties held in both and depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december   mainly because of an increase of overall assets through multiple acquisitions occurring in and a full year of expense in compared to a partial year of expense in for the seven properties acquired after the initial offering in the company did not incur a material amount of tenant improvements  capital expenditures  or lease commissions as related to gross real estate asset value in included in the depreciation and amortization expense for was the effect of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  on acquisitions 
this accounting pronouncement requires the allocation of a portion of a property s purchase price to intangible assets for leases acquired and in place at the closing date of the acquisition 
these intangible assets are amortized over the remaining life of the leases ranging from years as compared to the building basis portion of the acquisition  which is depreciated over years 
the amortization associated with the acquired lease intangible assets recorded on acquisitions totaled million 
service operations development and project management fees decreased significantly in to million compared to million in because the project management fee reported for contained a design build development contract for a project in chattanooga  tennessee 
this contract differs from the more common fee for service contracts in that all payments are made from the client to hadc and then from hadc to the contractors 
therefore  the changes in revenues are offset by corresponding changes in costs of sales and project costs 
the decrease in total loss from service operations for the year ended december  of million  as compared to the year ended december  of million  is primarily attributable to an increase in the third party services completed as well as significant restructuring of hadc in order to position it to provide services that are of greater direct benefit to the company 
a result of this restructuring is that both project costs and general and administrative expenses were lower in the third and fourth quarter as compared each of the quarter s prior and in the year general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses  including the expenses at hadc  were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase between the two years is mostly due to having a full year of the additional costs associated with being a public company in the year end totals  while had four and one half months of these expenses plus the increased expenses in anticipation of a public offering 
management believes that there will be additional cost associated with compliance of sarbanes oxley section and other corporate governance issues 
additionally  if the company acquires additional properties  additional staff and or other increases to general or administrative expenses may be required  therefore the expense level for should be moderately higher than the levels recorded in other income and expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  although the company benefited from significantly lower interest rates during the year  interest expense increased because of increased borrowings during the year 
the increased borrowings reflected the funding of the company s acquisitions during the year  along with the debt assumed in conjunction with those acquisitions 
the company utilizes a mix of fixed and variable rate pieces of debt 
as of december   the face value balance of fixed rate debt was million  while the balance of variable rate debt was million 
of the total debt in place during  fixed rate debt represented from to of total debt 
table of contents and variable rate debt represented between to throughout the year 
in addition to million of debt assumed as part of the property acquisitions  the company obtained two pieces of new debt during the year of on may  the company obtained a million fixed rate mortgage on the las vegas  nevada property at s 
eastern 
the mortgage has a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of april  on august   the company obtained a million variable rate loan on the rush copley property in aurora  illinois 
the mortgage has a variable interest rate of libor and the maturity date of august  the company retired million of debt in august  related to the variable rate mortgage debt assumed during the acquisition of the th avenue property 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental operations no activity related to rental operations was reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and as the company had no rental operations prior to august  rental operations revenue for the period august  through december  was million 
rental operations revenue is driven by income generated from properties held for rental purposes 
the amount of rental revenue and operating expenses recognized during is entirely related to the acquisition of the seven properties discussed above following completion of the initial offering 
the urology center of the south near memphis  tennessee and the four outpatient treatment centers in las vegas  nevada operated by sierra health services were acquired by the company on august  the company purchased partell medical center in las vegas  nevada and park medical center in charlotte  north carolina on november  and december   respectively 
rental operations revenue in thousands property name august september october november december total sierra health services properties urology center of the south partell medical center park medical center total the leases pertaining to the four outpatient treatment centers in las vegas  nevada and the urology center of the south near memphis  tennessee are all net leases and therefore all operating expenses are paid by the tenants in accordance with the terms of the lease 
rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  and the buildings are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated life not to exceed years 
service operations development and project management fees increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the significant increase is due to a signing of a design build contract by hadc on a development project in chattanooga  tennessee 
this contract differs from the previously used fee for service contracts in that all payments are made from the client to hadc and then from hadc to the contractors 
therefore  the increase in revenue is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in cost of sales and project costs 
the decrease in total income from service operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a decline in construction activities and consulting revenue earned by hadc 
during  hadc s resources devoted considerable time to efforts connected with the company s initial offering as well as potential acquisition and development projects for the operating partnership 
management of hadc is committed to rebuilding its third party consulting services practice to ensure that hadc operations achieve acceptable levels of profitability 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses  including expenses at hadc  were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is the result of the additional costs associated with the increases in staff and other operational changes in contemplation of and subsequent to the initial offering 
in order to increase shareholder return  management is focused on managing general and administrative expenses 
management believes the company currently has sufficient resources at the corporate level to manage a substantial increase in the size of its portfolio 
therefore  as rental properties are added to the portfolio  general and administrative expenses should not grow proportionately 
the following chart shows the general and administrative expense for each of the business segments quarter august ended year ended year ended september  december  december  december  general and administrative expenses corporate rental operations    n a service operations hadc total other income and expenses the increase in other expenses was primarily due to the loss recognized on the interest rate swap instrument during the year ended december  the company currently has one interest rate swap contract that does not meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas to qualify for hedge accounting 
sfas requires that unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying as hedge accounting be recognized currently in earnings 
the interest rate swap was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the urology center of the south brierbrook  llc and the debt related to the swap was retired at the time of the acquisition 
financial results for the period august  through december  were impacted by the loss on the fair value of the interest rate swap and the monthly amount paid or received on the interest rate swap that resulted from changes in the libor interest rate 
fluctuations in the interest rate market indicated an increase of  in the fair value or the amount the company would be required to pay to retire the swap instrument 
at this time the company does not intend to retire this swap during its life  and if not retired  then it will expire  and the company will not realize this loss related to changes in the fair value of the swap 
the swap expiration date is june  critical accounting policies impairment of real estate assets the company utilizes the guidelines established under sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to determine if impairment conditions exist 
under sfas  the company compares the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property in its portfolio to the net carrying value to determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property 
the review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value 
in addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows  the company assesses other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the property 
these assumptions are subjective and may not ultimately be achieved 
acquisitions of real estate assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations sfas  the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets building and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 

table of contents the value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in acquired lease intangibles and below market leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in place lease values and customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the company s overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the company s existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
valuation of receivables the company reviews each account receivable for collectibility and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts as specific accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible 
revenue and cost recognition contract revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the efforts expended  whereby the percentage complete is based on hours incurred in relation to total estimated hours to be incurred 
costs associated with obtaining contracts are expensed as incurred 
any change in the estimated total hours to be incurred on a contract could have a material impact on the company s estimated contract percentage completion and as a result could have a material impact on the company s net income or loss since such estimates are based upon the estimate of work to be performed on individual contracts 
audit committee review with regards to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting  methodology in applying  and impact on the financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by the company 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity rental operations the company believes that its principal source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
the company believes that this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
the company is subject to risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
secured credit facilities the company has the following lines of credit available amounts borrowing maturity interest outstanding at description capacity date rate december  syndicated line of credit facility  september libor none working capital line of credit facility  october prime none 
table of contents on october  the company entered into a million secured mezzanine credit facility with huntington national bank

uses of liquidity short term uses the company has considered its short term one year or less liquidity needs and currently expects that its estimated cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources will be adequate to meet these needs 
the company believes that its principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service requirements and the minimum distribution required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the internal revenue code 
the company anticipates that these needs will be met with cash flows provided by operating activities 
the company has also considered capital improvements  property acquisitions and development projects planned for as short term needs that will be funded either from the million available on the company s syndicated line of credit or the issuance of additional equity securities under the shelf registration statement on file with the sec that permits the company to sell up to an additional million of common and preferred shares of beneficial interest as of january  long term uses the company expects to meet long term greater than one year liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other nonrecurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities 
the company will acquire or develop additional properties only as suitable opportunities arise that meet the company s acquisition criteria and only if satisfactory financing arrangements are available 
historical cash flows operating activities on december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal  operational requirements 
the receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the primary source of revenues and operating cash flows for the company investing activities investing activities are one of the primary uses of the company s liquidity 
development and acquisition activity is necessary to generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of the fifteen medical properties discussed above 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  these proceeds were generated primarily from the secondary common offering and the issuance of million of mortgage notes  net of million of cash distributions to shareholders and minority interest

risks relating to the healthcare industry reductions in reimbursement from third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  could adversely affect the profitability of our tenants and hinder their ability to make rent payments to us 
sources of revenue for our tenants and operators may include the federal medicare program  state medicaid programs  private insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations  among others 
efforts by such payors to reduce healthcare costs will likely continue  which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants 
in addition  the failure of any of our tenants to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their ability to continue participating in medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored payment programs 
the healthcare industry continues to face various challenges  including increased government and private payor pressure on healthcare providers to control or reduce costs 
we believe that our tenants will continue to experience a shift away from fee for service payors resulting in an increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to managed care payors 
pressures to control healthcare costs and a shift away from traditional health insurance reimbursement to managed care plans have resulted in an increase in the number of patients whose healthcare coverage is provided under managed care plans  such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
these changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of some or all of our tenants  which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 

table of contents the healthcare industry is heavily regulated  and new laws or regulations  changes to existing laws or regulations  loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of our tenants to make lease payments to us 
the healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal  state and local governmental bodies 
our tenants generally will be subject to laws and regulations covering  among other things  licensure  certification for participation in government programs and relationships with physicians and other referral sources 
changes in these laws and regulations could negatively affect the ability of our tenants to make lease payments to us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
many of our medical properties and their tenants may require a license or certificate of need to operate 
failure to obtain a license or certificate of need  or loss of a required license would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the tenants 
these events could materially adversely affect the facility operator s ability to make rent payments to us 
state and local laws also may regulate expansion  including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment  and the construction of healthcare facilities  by requiring a certificate of need or other similar approval 
our real estate investments are concentrated in specialty medical properties  making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified 
as a reit  we invest primarily in real estate 
within the real estate industry  we primarily acquire or selectively develop and own specialty medical properties 
we are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate 
these risks resulting from a lack of diversification become even greater as a result of our business strategy to invest primarily in specialty medical properties 
a downturn in the real estate industry could significantly adversely affect the value of our properties 
a downturn in the healthcare industry could negatively affect our tenants ability to make lease payments to us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
these adverse effects could be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real estate or outside of specialty medical properties 
adverse trends in healthcare provider operations may negatively affect our lease revenues and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
the healthcare industry is currently experiencing changes in the demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services  changes in third party reimbursement policies  significant unused capacity in certain areas  which has created substantial competition for patients among healthcare providers in those areas  continuing pressure by private and governmental payors to reduce payments to providers of services  and increased scrutiny of billing  referral and other practices by federal and state authorities 
these factors may adversely affect the economic performance of some or all of our tenants and  in turn  our lease revenues and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
our lessees are subject to fraud and abuse laws  the violation of which by a lessee may jeopardize the tenant s ability to make rent payments to us 
the federal government and numerous state governments have passed laws and regulations that attempt to eliminate healthcare fraud and abuse by prohibiting business arrangements that induce patient referrals or the ordering of specific ancillary services 
in addition  the balanced budget act of strengthened the federal anti fraud and abuse laws to provide for stiffer penalties for violations 
violations of these laws may result in the imposition of criminal and civil penalties  including possible exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs 
imposition of any of these penalties upon one of our tenants could jeopardize the tenant s ability to operate a facility or to make rent payments  thereby potentially adversely affecting us 
our lease arrangements with certain tenants may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws 
risks relating to our business  growth strategy and organizational structure we may be unable to acquire or may be delayed in acquiring specialty medical properties  which may result in a reduction in the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
our inability to acquire  or delays in acquiring  properties may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  if we do not complete acquisitions as expected  an offering of equity securities will have a significant dilutive impact on our common shares until we are able to efficiently deploy the proceeds of the offering 
dependence on our tenants for rent may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 

table of contents as a reit operating in the healthcare industry  we are not permitted by current tax law to operate or manage the businesses conducted in our facilities 
accordingly  we rely exclusively on rent payments from our tenants for cash with which to make distributions to shareholders 
we have no control over the success or failure of our tenants businesses 
reductions in the net operating income of our tenants may adversely affect the ability of our tenants to make rent payments to us and thus our ability to make anticipated distributions to our shareholders 
failure on the part of a tenant to comply materially with the terms of a lease would give us the right to terminate our lease with that tenant  repossess the applicable property and enforce the payment obligations under the lease 
however  we then would be required to find another tenant 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to find another tenant or that  if another tenant were found  we would be able to enter into a lease on favorable terms 
we rely disproportionately on one tenant for our rental income 
southwest medical associates  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of sierra health services  inc  leases of the rentable square footage in our sierra health services properties 
the total area leased by southwest medical associates  square feet comprises approximately of our total annualized base rental revenue as of december  significant adverse changes in the operations of any property  or the operations or financial condition of any tenant  particularly southwest medical associates  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect rent payments and  accordingly  on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
we do not know if our lessees will renew their existing leases  and if they do not  we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 
we cannot predict whether existing leases of our properties will be renewed at the end of their lease terms  which expire at various times through if these leases are not renewed  we would be required to find other tenants for those properties 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 
failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 
we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue to experience rapid growth in the future 
following the completion of our initial public offering in august  we acquired seven specialty medical properties with the proceeds of the offering 
as of december   we have acquired additional specialty medical properties 
our rapid growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management 
future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on  and require us to expand  our management  resources and personnel 
our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and  in particular  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
in particular  we could have difficulty assimilating acquired properties and integrating their operations into our organization 
failure to effectively integrate newly acquired properties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
our rapid growth could also increase our capital requirements  which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 
certain of our properties may not have efficient alternative uses 
some of our properties  such as our ambulatory surgery centers  are specialized medical facilities 
if we or our tenants terminate the leases for these properties or our tenants lose their regulatory authority to operate such properties  we may not be able to locate suitable replacement tenants to lease the properties for their specialized uses 
alternatively  we may be required to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses 
any loss of revenues and or additional capital expenditures occurring as a result could hinder our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
our business is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully 
we will compete for development opportunities and opportunities to purchase medical properties with  among others private investors  healthcare providers  including physicians  healthcare related reits  real estate partnerships  financial institutions  and local developers 

table of contents many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may have better relationships with lenders and sellers 
we intend to adhere to our acquisition strategy and criteria 
however  increased competition for medical properties from competitors  including other reits  may adversely affect our ability to acquire specialty medical properties and the price we pay for properties 
if we are unable to acquire properties or if we pay too much for properties  our revenue and earnings growth could be adversely affected 
our properties face competition from other nearby facilities that provide services comparable to those offered at our facilities 
some of those facilities are owned by governmental agencies and supported by tax revenues  and others are owned by nonprofit corporations and may be supported to a large extent by endowments and charitable contributions 
those types of support are not available to our facilities 
in addition  competing healthcare facilities located in the areas served by our facilities may provide health services that are not available at our facilities 
from time to time  referral sources  including physicians and managed care organizations  may change their lists of healthcare facilities to which they refer patients  which could adversely affect our rental revenues 
our use of debt financing subjects us to significant risks  including refinancing risk and the risk of insufficient cash available for distribution 
our declaration of trust and other organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt we may incur 
debt  whether with recourse to us generally or only with respect to a particular property  creates risks 
for example  variable rate debt can reduce the cash available for distribution to shareholders in periods of rising interest rates 
we intend to incur debt only when we believe it will enhance our risk adjusted returns 
however  we cannot assure you that our use of financial leverage will prove to be beneficial 
at december   the outstanding face value principal balance of our indebtedness was approximately million 
we may borrow additional amounts in the future  or we may issue corporate debt securities in public or private offerings 
some of these additional borrowings may be secured by our properties 
in addition  in connection with debt financing  we are subject to covenants that restrict our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the restrictive covenants and  to the extent that we cannot  we risk the loss of some or all of our properties to foreclosure 
we anticipate that our debt will be a blend of long term amortizing debt and variable rate non amortizing debt  both payable in substantial balloon payments upon maturity 
therefore  we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources  such as new equity capital or sales of properties  our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due 
additionally  under the terms of much of the debt that we have assumed  we may incur significant yield maintenance penalties if we choose to prepay the debt 
conflicts of interest could result in an executive officer or a trustee acting other than in our best interest 
as described further below  our executive officers and trustees have conflicts of interest resulting from the formation transactions at the time of our initial public offering  their duties to our shareholders and the limited partners of our operating partnership  and allocation of their time between our business and affairs and their other business interests 
conflicts of interest resulting from the formation transactions may lead to decisions that are not in our best interest 
three of our executive officers  messrs 
klipsch  mccoin and farrar  one of whom also serves as a trustee mr 
klipsch  and one trustee who is not an executive officer mr 
lanham owned  directly or indirectly  of the equity interests in windrose international  llc 
at the time of completion of our initial public offering  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of windrose international  including the stock of hadc  in exchange for an aggregate of  units of partnership interest in our operating partnership 
additionally  four of our executive officers  messrs 
klipsch  mccoin  batts and hanson  and mr 
lanham  who serves as a trustee  owned approximately of the class a limited liability company interests in brierbrook partners 
we acquired the class a limited liability company interests in brierbrook partners owned by these officers and trustees in exchange for an aggregate of  units of partnership interest in our formation transactions 
as of december   messrs 
klipsch  mccoin  farrar and lanham owned approximately    and of the equity interests in our operating partnership  respectively 
the terms and conditions of these purchases were not negotiated in arm s length transactions 
additionally  our trustees and executive officers have unrealized gains associated with their interests in these assets  and  as a result  any sale of these assets or refinancing or prepayment of principal on the indebtedness assumed by us in purchasing these assets may cause adverse tax consequences to some of our trustees and executive officers 
these individuals may not be supportive of the disposition or refinancing of these properties when it might otherwise be the optimal time for us to do so 
our trustees may have conflicting duties 
our trustees may have conflicting duties because  in their capacities as our trustees  they have a duty to us  and in our capacity as general partner of our operating 
table of contents partnership  they have a fiduciary duty to the limited partners of our operating partnership 
conflicts may arise when interests of our shareholders and the limited partners of our operating partnership diverge  particularly in circumstances in which there may be an adverse tax consequence to the limited partners  such as upon the sale of assets or the repayment of indebtedness 
the partnership agreement of our operating partnership contains a provision requiring the general partner to resolve  to the extent possible  in favor of our shareholders  any matters in which there is a conflict between the rights of the limited partners of the operating partnership and the rights of our shareholders 
it may not always be possible  however  for a resolution to be reached which favors our shareholders 
some of our trustees and executive officers have other business interests that may hinder their ability to spend adequate time on our business 
mr 
klipsch  chairman of our board of trustees and our chief executive officer  also serves as the chairman of the board of directors of klipsch audio  inc mr 
farrar  our president and chief operating officer  also serves as executive vice president of klipsch audio  inc although messrs 
klipsch and farrar devote substantially all of their time to managing our company  as a result of their management obligations with this other company  messrs 
klipsch and farrar may find it difficult to allocate their time between this other company and us 
if messrs 
klipsch and farrar do not allocate sufficient time to the management of our operations  it could jeopardize our ability to execute our business plan 
provisions of maryland law  our declaration of trust and our bylaws may deter changes in management and third party acquisition proposals or cause dilution 
our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities 
to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  no more than of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer persons during the last half of each taxable year other than our first reit taxable year 
to preserve our reit qualification  our declaration of trust generally prohibits direct or indirect ownership by any person of more than of the number of outstanding shares of any class of our securities  including our common shares 
generally  common shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limitation 
any transfer of our common shares that would violate the ownership limitation will be null and void  and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares 
instead  such common shares will be designated as shares in trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer of such shares 
the beneficiary of a trust will be one or more charitable organizations named by us 
the ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of common shares might receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price or which such holders otherwise might believe to be in their best interests 
the ownership limitation provisions also may make our common shares an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain  either alone or with others as a group  ownership of more than in value of our shares 
the declaration of trust contains a provision that creates staggered terms for our board of trustees 
our board of trustees is divided into three classes 
the current terms of our class i  class ii and class iii trustees will expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in    respectively 
upon the expiration of their current terms  trustees of each class are elected to serve for three year terms and until their successors are duly elected and qualify 
each year one class of trustees will be elected by the shareholders at the annual meeting of shareholders 
moreover  such trustees generally may not be removed as trustees until the end of their terms except by the affirmative vote of two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of trustees 
the staggered terms of trustees may delay  defer or prevent a tender offer  a change in control or other transaction in which holders of common shares might receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price or which such holders otherwise might believe to be in their best interests 
the maryland business combination act may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
under the maryland general corporation law  as amended mgcl  as applicable to reits  certain business combinations including certain issuances of equity securities between a maryland reit and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust s shares  or an affiliate thereof  are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the person or affiliate acquired at least ten percent of the voting power of the trust s shares 
thereafter  any business combination must be approved by two super majority shareholder votes unless  among other conditions  the trust s common shareholders receive a minimum price as defined in the mgcl for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares 
these provisions could delay  deter or prevent a change of control or other transaction in which holders of our common shares might receive a premium for their common shares above the then current market price or which such shareholders otherwise might believe to be in their best interests 
our board of trustees may issue additional shares that may cause dilution 
our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees  without shareholder approval  to amend the declaration of trust to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of beneficial interest or the number of shares of beneficial interest of any class or series that we have the authority to issue  cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares  and 
table of contents classify or reclassify any unissued common or preferred shares and to set the preferences  rights and other terms of such classified or reclassified shares  including the issuance of additional common shares or preferred shares that have preference rights over the common shares with respect to dividends  liquidation  voting and other matters 
future issuances of equity securities may cause our shareholders to experience further dilution 
our board of trustees may issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
although our board of trustees has no present intention to do so  it could establish one or more series of preferred shares that could  depending on the terms of such series  delay  deter or prevent a change in control or other transaction in which holders of our common shares might receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price or which such holders otherwise might believe to be in their best interests 
our declaration of trust and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction in which holders of our common shares might receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price or which such holders otherwise might believe to be in their best interests 
two of our executive officers have agreements that provide them with benefits in the event their employment is terminated following a change in control of our company 
we have entered into agreements with messrs 
klipsch and farrar  chairman of our board of trustees and chief executive officer and president and chief operating officer  respectively  which provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends under certain circumstances following a change in control of our company 
these benefits and related tax indemnity could prevent or deter a change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders 
we have limited operating history as a reit and may not be able to successfully and profitably operate our business 
we completed our initial public offering in august although our executive officers and some of our trustees have experience in developing  financing and purchasing medical properties  they have limited experience operating a reit and  other than our chairman  have limited experience in managing a publicly owned company 
since our initial public offering in august  hadc has failed to generate income sufficient to cover its expenses 
to the extent that operating losses at hadc continue  or increase  the operating results of our company will be negatively affected  our cash flows will be reduced  and we will have less cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
our board of trustees may change our investment and operational policies without a vote of our common shareholders 
our major policies  including our policies with respect to acquisitions  financing  growth  operations  debt limitation and distributions  are determined by the board of trustees 
the board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of the holders of the common shares 
investment and operational policy changes could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
a significant number of our properties are located in las vegas  nevada  making us vulnerable to changes in economic conditions in that particular market 
at december   five of our properties  representing approximately of our annual rental revenue for the year ended december   are located in las vegas  nevada 
as a result  localized adverse events or conditions  such as an economic recession or overbuilding in the local real estate market  could have a significant adverse effect on the operations of our properties  and ultimately on the amounts available for distribution to shareholders 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of which may threaten our ability to operate our business successfully 
we depend on the services of our existing senior management to carry out our business and investment strategies 
if we were to lose any of our senior executive officers  particularly messrs 
klipsch or farrar  it may be more difficult to locate attractive acquisition targets or manage the properties that we acquire 
additionally  as we expand  we will continue to need to attract and retain qualified additional senior management 
the loss of the services of any of our senior management personnel  or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our board of trustees and management make decisions on our behalf  and shareholders have limited management rights 

table of contents common shareholders have no right or power to take part in our management except through the exercise of voting rights on certain specified matters 
the board of trustees is responsible for our management and strategic business direction  and management is responsible for our day to day operations 
certain policies of our board of trustees may not be consistent with the immediate best interests of shareholders 
shares available for future sale may have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares 
sales of a substantial number of our common shares  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common shares 
as of december   there were  outstanding operating partnership units held by limited partners that are redeemable  at the election of the holder  for cash  or  at our election  for our common shares 
upon the redemption of operating partnership units  any common shares received therefore may be sold in the public market pursuant to a shelf registration statement that we have filed on behalf of the limited partners of our operating partnership  or pursuant to any available exemption from registration 
in addition  as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase  common shares and outstanding warrants to purchase  common shares 
upon exercise of these options and warrants  the common shares received therefore may be sold in the public market pursuant to a registration statement or pursuant to an available exemption from registration 
we are the general partner of our operating partnership and may become liable for the debts and other obligations of this partnership beyond the amount of our investment 
we are the general partner of our operating partnership  windrose medical properties  lp  and  as of december   we owned an approximate interest in the operating partnership 
as general partner  we are liable for the partnership s debts and other obligations 
if the partnership is unable to pay its debts and other obligations  as general partner we will be liable for such debts and other obligations beyond the amount of our investment in the partnership 
these obligations could include unforeseen contingent liabilities 
the market value of our common shares could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions 
the market value of our common shares may be based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and current and future cash dividends  and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of our underlying assets 
the market price of our common shares is influenced by the dividend on our common shares relative to market interest rates 
rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common shares to expect a higher dividend rate  which would adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
in addition  rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on variable rate debt  thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends 
tax related risks loss of our tax status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common shares 
we have operated and intend to continue operating in a manner that will allow us to maintain our reit status for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code  which will depend on our ability to meet various requirements concerning  among other things  the ownership of our outstanding common shares  the nature of our assets  the sources of our income and the amount of our distributions to our shareholders 
the reit qualification requirements are extremely complex  and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a reit are limited 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we will continue to be successful in operating so as to maintain our reit status 
at any time  new laws  interpretations  or court decisions may change the federal tax laws relating to  or the federal income tax consequences of  qualification as a reit 
it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause the board of trustees to revoke the reit election  which it may do without shareholder approval 
if we lose or revoke our reit status  we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to you because we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay any such tax  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  all distributions to shareholders would be subject to tax as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  we would not be required to 
table of contents make distributions to shareholders and corporate distributees might be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
as a result of all these factors  our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital  and would adversely affect the value of our common shares 
failure to make required distributions would subject us to tax 
in order to qualify as a reit  each year we must distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income  other than any net capital gain 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will incur a non deductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of of our reit ordinary income for that year  of our reit capital gain net income for that year  and of our undistributed taxable income from prior years 
we have paid out and intend to continue paying out our income to our shareholders in a manner intended to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the non deductible excise tax 
differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax in a particular year 
in the future  we may borrow to pay distributions to our shareholders and the limited partners of our operating partnership 
any funds that we borrow would subject us to interest rate and other market risks 
recent changes in taxation of corporate dividends may adversely affect the value of our common shares 
the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  which was enacted into law on may   among other things  generally reduces to the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by domestic non corporate taxpayers on dividends received from a regular c corporation 
this reduced tax rate  however  will not apply to dividends paid to most domestic non corporate taxpayers by a reit on its stock  except for certain limited amounts 
although the earnings of a reit that are distributed to its shareholders still generally will be subject to less federal income taxation than earnings of a non reit c corporation that are distributed to its shareholders net of corporate level income tax  this legislation could cause domestic non corporate investors to view the stock of regular c corporations as more attractive relative to the stock of a reit than was the case prior to the enactment of the legislation  because the dividends from regular c corporations will generally be taxed at a lower rate while dividends from reits will generally be taxed at the same rate as the individual s other ordinary income 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  the enactment of this legislation may have on the value of the stock of reits in general or on our common shares in particular  either in terms of price or relative to other investments 
risks relating to real estate investments illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our medical properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited 
no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons 
our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisitions and development properties may under perform forecasted results or we may be limited in our ability to finance future acquisitions  which may harm our financial condition and operating results  and we may not be able to make the distributions required to maintain our reit status 
we intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and to selectively develop new properties 
acquisitions and development entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations and that estimates of the cost of improvements necessary to develop and acquire properties will prove inaccurate  as well as general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment 
we anticipate that acquisitions and development will largely be financed through externally generated funds such as borrowings under credit facilities and other secured and unsecured debt financing and from issuances of equity securities 
because we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income each year to maintain our qualification as a reit  our ability to rely upon income from operations or cash flow from operations to finance our growth and acquisition activities will be limited 
accordingly  if we are unable to obtain funds from borrowings or the capital markets to finance our acquisition and development activities  our ability to grow could be curtailed  amounts available for distribution to shareholders could be adversely affected and we could be required to reduce distributions 

table of contents properties with limited operating history may not achieve forecasted results  which could hinder our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
newly developed or newly renovated properties do not have the operating history that would allow our management to make objective pricing decisions in acquiring these properties 
the purchase prices of these properties are based upon projections by management as to the expected operating results of such properties  subjecting us to risks that such properties may not achieve anticipated operating results or may not achieve these results within anticipated time frames 
if we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of our insurance coverage limits  we could lose investment capital and anticipated profits 
we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our properties 
insurance coverages on a property include liability and fire insurance and extended coverage insurance in amounts sufficient to permit the replacement of the property in the event of a total loss  subject to applicable deductibles 
however  there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes  floods  hurricanes and acts of terrorism that may be uninsurable or not insurable at a price we can afford 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors also might make it impracticable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
under such circumstances  the insurance proceeds we receive might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the affected property 
if any of these or similar events occur  it may reduce our return from the property and the value of our investment 
capital expenditures for property renovation may be greater than forecasted and may adversely impact rent payments by our tenants and our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
properties  particularly those that consist of older structures  have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements  including periodic replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
under the terms of our multi tenant property leases  we generally are obligated to pay the cost of expenditures for items that are necessary for the continued operation of our properties and that are classified under generally accepted accounting principles as capital items 
if these capital expenditures exceed our estimates  the additional costs could have an adverse effect on amounts available for distribution to shareholders 
in addition  we may acquire properties in the future that require significant renovation 
renovation of properties involves certain risks  including the possibility of environmental problems  construction cost overruns and delays  uncertainties as to market demand or deterioration in market demand after commencement of renovation and the emergence of unanticipated competition from properties 
all of our medical properties are subject to property taxes that may increase in the future and adversely affect our business 
our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as property tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities 
our leases generally provide that the property taxes are charged to the tenants as an expense related to the properties that they occupy 
as the owner of the properties  however  we are ultimately responsible for payment of the taxes to the government 
if property taxes increase  our tenants may be unable to make the required tax payments  ultimately requiring us to pay the taxes 
if we incur these tax liabilities  our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected 
our financial performance and the price of our common shares will be affected by risks associated with the real estate industry 
factors that may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our operations include changes in the national  regional and local economic climate  local conditions such as an oversupply of  or a reduction in demand for  medical office space  outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities  physician practice group clinics  ambulatory surgery centers and specialty hospitals and treatment centers  attractiveness of our properties to physicians and other types of tenants  and competition from other medical office buildings  outpatient treatment facilities  physician practice group clinics  ambulatory surgery centers and specialty hospitals and treatment centers 
as the owner and lessor of real estate  we are subject to risks under environmental laws  compliance with which and any violation of which could materially adversely affect us 
our operating expenses could be higher than anticipated due to the cost of complying with existing and future environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations 
various environmental laws may impose liability on a current or prior owner or operator of real property for removal or remediation of 
table of contents hazardous or toxic substances 
current or prior owners or operators may also be liable for government fines and damages for injuries to persons  natural resources and adjacent property 
these environmental laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence or disposal of the hazardous or toxic substances 
the cost of complying with environmental laws could materially adversely affect amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and could exceed the value of all of our properties 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure of our tenants to properly dispose of or remediate such substances  including medical waste generated by physicians and our other healthcare tenants  may adversely affect our tenants or our ability to use  sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which  in turn  could reduce our revenue and our financing ability 
we have obtained phase i environmental assessments on all of our properties to date and intend to do so with respect to any future properties we acquire 
however  even if the phase i environmental assessment reports do not reveal any material environmental contamination  it is nonetheless possible that material environmental liabilities may exist of which we are unaware 
although the leases covering our properties generally require the tenants to comply with laws and regulations governing their operations  including the disposal of medical waste  and to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities  the scope of their obligations may be limited 
we cannot assure you that our tenants would be able to fulfill their indemnification obligations 
in addition  environmental and occupational health and safety laws are constantly evolving  and changes in laws  regulations or policies  or changes in interpretations of the foregoing  could create liabilities where none exist today 
costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
under the americans with disabilities act of  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
while we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  a determination that we are not in compliance with the americans with disabilities act could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
in addition  changes in governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the use and operation of the properties  including changes to building codes and fire and life safety codes  may occur 
if we were required to make substantial modifications at the properties to comply with the americans with disabilities act or other changes in governmental rules and regulations  our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected 
our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 
we have acquired an interest in two of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located  and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases 
as lessee under ground leases  we would be exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination  or an earlier breach by us  of the ground lease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
the company s future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
as of december   total outstanding debt of the company was approximately million 
the current outstanding debt balances relate to mortgages assumed through the property acquisitions 
the fair value of this debt approximates its carrying value 
included in the total debt related to mortgages is a variable rate mortgage which had a principal balance outstanding at december  of million 
a one percentage point fluctuation in market interest rates would have had a  impact on net earnings in on september   the company entered into a million secured credit facility with huntington national bank based in columbus  ohio 
on december   the company amended its secured credit facility  increasing the funds available under the facility to million from million and extended the maturity date to september borrowing availability under the amended facility is dependent upon the collateral pool securing the facility 
five banks are participating in the credit facility 
huntington national bank of columbus  ohio is the lead arranger and administrative agent 
the credit facility bears interest at variable rates of libor plus depending on the company s leverage ratio 
this line of credit contains covenants that require  among other things  the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at december   the amount outstanding on the line of credit was the company has one interest rate swap contract that does not meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas

sfas requires that unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying as hedge accounting be recognized currently in earnings 
the interest rate swap was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the urology center of the south and the debt related to the swap was retired at the time of the acquisition 
during the year ended december   the company recognized a gain of  from this interest rate swap contract 
the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a  liability
