item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the world s largest specialty retailer of video game hardware and software  pc entertainment software  pre played video games and related accessories and products 
as of january   we operated a total of  stores in states  australia  canada  denmark  germany  italy  new zealand  norway  puerto rico  south korea and sweden primarily under the names eb games and electronics boutique 
in addition  we operated a commercial website under the url address www 
ebgames 
com 
we operate in the interactive entertainment industry and are headquartered in west chester  pennsylvania 
we are a holding company and do not have any significant assets or liabilities  other than all of the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest january in fiscal  we established company records for revenues  net income and store growth 
in addition  we increased our market share while outpacing our industry and strengthened our presence in international markets 
our comparable store sales for fiscal were even with last year 
while we experienced negative comparable store sales in our domestic mall based stores for the year  these results were more than offset by strong  double digit increases in both our strip center stores and our international locations 
our success in fiscal was driven primarily by a significant increase in software sales  which in turn was the result of an increase in the installed hardware base 
our store growth focused on establishing locations in strip centers  which enable us to compete with mass merchants and build our pre played business  and continuing our international expansion 
additionally  in fiscal we continued to re brand our stores to eb games  further strengthening our brand identity 
our success has been  and will continue to be  contingent upon our ability to understand trends in our industry and to manage our business in response to these trends 
for example  the interactive entertainment industry is cyclical as new technology is generally introduced every four to five years 
we have historically achieved strong market share in the first few years of these cycles and then experienced subsequent declines as product prices fell and mass market retailers attracted consumers at the latter part of the cycle 
our current strategy to retain market share has been to expand our business through the opening of strip center stores  which we believe attract the value conscious consumers that previously shopped through the mass market retail channel 
additionally  to increase profitability in all of our locations  we are focused on expanding our pre played business and new ways to drive sales of new titles 
our success is dependent upon our ability to continue to grow the business in a profitable manner 
management reviews several key indicators to evaluate our performance in achieving profit and sales growth 
sales growth is evaluated by measuring contributions generated from new store expansion and changes in comparable store sales 
in addition  we measure our sales performance by analyzing changes in our market share relative to the overall industry 
gross margin is monitored for the impact of product mix as well as inventory obsolescence and losses 
product mix shifts throughout each industry cycle with lower margin hardware sales declining as a percentage of total sales while higher margin software sales increase 
a prime driver of this shift has been the continual growth of the installed hardware base  which increased in calendar by to approximately million units in the united states 
we also review the growth of pre played sales in relation to our total sales mix  as these pre played sales are one of our higher margin categories 
on january   we terminated our services agreement with game group plc 
formerly the electronics boutique plc 
for an agreed upon amount of million 
prior to termination  we provided management services to game group and received fees equal to of game group s adjusted sales  plus a bonus calculated on the basis of net income in excess of a pre established target set by game group 
the termination agreement prohibits us from competing with game group in the united kingdom and ireland until february and in france and spain until february game group may not compete with us in germany and italy until february we have a positive outlook for fiscal we plan to open approximately stores during the next fiscal year 
of these are expected to be strip center stores based in north america and the remaining stores will be predominantly based outside the united states 
we anticipate funding this store expansion with cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we expect to continue our strong software sales as hardware prices decrease  and continue to strengthen our pre played business through our increased presence in strip center locations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our results may differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following policies to be most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation our merchandise inventory  which includes new and pre played video game hardware and software as well as pc entertainment software and related accessories and products  is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost is determined principally by a weighted average method 
the weighted average cost method attaches a cost to each stock keeping unit sku  and is a blended average of the original purchase price and those of subsequent purchases or other cost adjustments throughout the life cycle of that sku 
we include an allocation of costs incurred to refurbish pre played products in order to prepare them for resale in the cost of our merchandise inventory 
inherent in the video game business is the risk of obsolete inventory 
as each new generation of products is introduced  demand for the prior generation decreases  reducing the interest in and value of the older games 
some vendors offer us credit to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility that these items become obsolete 
we monitor the aging of our inventory by item and provide a reserve for products that are considered slow moving  using an established formula based on current inventory and a trailing sales history 
we also monitor the difference between the selling market price of each item and its cost and provide a reserve for any inventory selling below cost 
we perform regular physical inventories and cycle counts in both our stores and distribution centers to adjust inventory balances and account for shrink and damaged product 
an accrual for estimated loss is recorded between the timing of these counts 
reserves of million and million were recorded against inventory as of january  and february   respectively 
management believes its inventory valuation system results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
revenue recognition and related policies we derive revenue primarily from two sources i product revenue  which includes the retail sale of merchandise inventory  warranties  subscriptions  and shipping and handling fees and ii management services revenue 
sales are recorded net of estimated amounts for sales returns and other allowances 
on january   we terminated our services agreement with game group initially established in fiscal as a result  management services will no longer be a source of revenue for us starting in fiscal retail sales are recognized as revenue at the point of sale 
mail order and internet sales are recognized as revenue upon delivery to and acceptance by the customer 
revenues from shipping and handling are recorded in revenue and recognized upon shipment 
warranty revenue is amortized over the life of the warranty contract 
magazine subscription revenue is recognized over the life of the subscription 
we also engage in the sale  purchase and trading of pre played video game products 
effective in the second quarter of fiscal  we changed our statement of income classification for pre played merchandise trade in activity to be consistent with industry practice 
previously  we recorded a reduction to both revenue and cost of goods sold for the cost of the pre played merchandise accepted for trade 
the reclassification of these transactions increased both revenues and cost of goods sold by million for the fifty two week period ended february  there was no impact on operating income or net income for any period as a result of this reclassification 
revenues for management services are recorded as earned 
in fiscal  management fees were derived from service agreements with game group and sports collectibles acquisition company scac as well as million earned as part of our termination of the services agreement with game group 
we received million from game group as part of the settlement for terminating the agreement 
based on an independent analysis  the covenants not to compete with game group in the united kingdom  ireland  france and spain were determined to have a value equal to million  which was recorded as deferred revenue 
based on the terms of these covenants  million and million will be recognized as income in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to federal  state and local income tax in many jurisdictions in the united states as well as internationally 
income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to our operations 
significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs  income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is unlikely  we are required to establish valuation allowances 
we established valuation allowances of  and  as of january  and february   respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries 
future tax expense may be impacted by this judgment 
as of january   we have recorded million of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards for which no valuation allowance is recorded 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets to determine if any part of the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important when assessing impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of an identifiable intangible or long lived asset may not be recoverable based on one or more of these factors  we test for impairment to determine if an impairment charge is required 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
we use a two step impairment assessment to determine if an impairment charge is required 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any 
after completing our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal  no impairment was required 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million and million as of january  and february   respectively 
see note to the consolidated financials statements for more details 
change in accounting principle in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
issue addresses the accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor by a reseller for various vendor funded allowances  including cooperative advertising support 
issue is effective for new arrangements or modifications to existing arrangements entered into after december   although early adoption is permitted 
we elected to adopt early  effective february   the provisions of issue in accordance with the provisions of issue  vendor advertising allowances which exceed specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred in relation to the advertising and promotional events we conduct for our vendors are to be classified as a reduction in the purchase price of merchandise and recognized in income as the merchandise is sold 
the amount of vendor allowances to be recorded as a reduction of inventory was determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific  incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases 
we then applied this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of the vendor reimbursements to be recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet 
this methodology resulted in a million reduction in inventory as of february   the date of adoption of issue the million  million net of tax  was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in fiscal for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years 
as of january  and february   million and million  respectively  of our vendor advertising allowances have been recorded as a reduction of inventory 
the following table reflects the vendor allowances received and how they were classified in the consolidated financial statements actual and pro forma for the change in accounting principle for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal amounts in thousands actual total vendor allowances    gross profit    percent to total revenues amount classified as reduction in cost of goods sold   percent to total revenues amount classified as reduction in selling  general administrative expense percent to total revenues amount classified as a reduction in merchandise inventory  pro forma gross profit  percent to total revenues amount classified as reduction in cost of goods sold  percent to total revenues amount classified as reduction in selling  general administrative expense percent to total revenues amount classified as a reduction in merchandise inventory prior to our adoption of issue  we recognized all vendor advertising allowances as an offset to selling  general and administrative expense 
these allowances exceeded the specific  incremental costs of the advertising and promotional events conducted by us 
the portion of the allowances in excess of the specific  incremental costs was recorded as an offset to other operating expenses within selling  general and administrative expense 
these other operating expenses  which were incurred to support advertising and promotional expenses  included marketing and merchandising department expenses to develop  promote and manage the events  direct store and store supervisory payroll expenses to implement  manage and monitor the events  distribution expenses associated with receiving and shipping of materials necessary for the events  and corporate expenses related to the design  production and maintenance of internet advertising events 
the following pro forma financial information for fiscal reflects the impact of issue as if it had been adopted prior to fiscal consolidated statements of income amounts in thousands  except per share amounts as reported fiscal pro forma fiscal net sales   management fees   total revenues   cost of goods sold   gross profit   costs and expenses selling  general and administrative expense   restructuring and asset impairment charge   depreciation and amortization   operating income   interest income  net   income before income taxes   income tax expense   net income   net income per share basic diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic   diluted   selected balance sheet information merchandise inventories   total stockholders equity   effective in the second quarter of fiscal  we changed the statement of income classification for pre played merchandise trade in activity to be consistent with industry practice 
previously  we recorded a reduction to both revenue and cost of goods sold for the cost of the pre played merchandise accepted for trade 
the reclassification of these transactions increased both revenues and cost of goods sold by million in fiscal there was no impact on operating income or net income for any period as a result of this reclassification 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of income items as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales management fees total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense restructuring and asset impairment reversal charge depreciation and amortization operating income interest income  net income before income tax expense and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the sales volume of approximately million resulting from new stores opened during fiscal  coupled with a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of million on comparable store sales in fiscal overall comparable store sales for fiscal were even to last year as increases in comparable store sales for our strip center locations offset decreases in comparable store sales for our mall based stores 
our net comparable store sales results compare favorably to the united states interactive entertainment industry  which experienced a decline of in fiscal net sales from the bc sports collectibles and eb kids stores for fiscal was million 
management fees increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to million of fees earned in connection with our termination of the services agreement with game group 
an increase in game group s sales and a more favorable currency exchange rate between the british pound and us dollar in fiscal accounted for the remainder of the increase 
cost of goods sold increased from million in fiscal to  million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to a shift in business from lower margin hardware products to higher margin software products  offset  in part  by a decrease in vendor allowances recognized in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold does not include purchasing and distribution center operating expenses of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  which are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
accordingly  our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to the cost of goods sold of other retailers 
cost of goods sold from the bc sports collectibles and eb kids stores for fiscal was million 
selling  general and administrative expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to expenses associated with a larger domestic and international store base and the associated increases in store expenses of million and headquarter expenses of million 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to expenses associated with opening new stores in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense from the bc sports collectibles and eb kids stores for fiscal was million 
we had a net reversal of million of the restructuring and asset impairment charge in fiscal resulting from our adoption of a plan in fiscal to close the operations of all eb kids stores and sell the store bc sports collectibles business 
the reversal was primarily related to store lease related accruals that were not necessary due to the terms of the sale of the bc sports collectibles business 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to capitalized expenditures for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for new store openings and the remodeling of existing stores  and fixtures  equipment and computer software at corporate headquarters and existing distribution centers 
operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  operating income was in both fiscal and fiscal excluding the million net reversal of the restructuring and asset impairment charge in fiscal  operating income would have been million  or of total revenues in fiscal due to favorable foreign exchange rates and continued growth in our international operations  the percentage of the foreign contribution to operating income increased from in fiscal to in fiscal operating loss from the bc sports collectibles and eb kids stores for fiscal was million 
income tax expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of income before income tax expense  income tax expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal our effective tax rate decreased from the prior year principally as a result of an increase in operations in foreign jurisdictions that have lower tax rates than the united states 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the additional sales volume from new stores  approximately million  opened during fiscal and a comparable store sales increase of  or million 
the increase was driven by continuing strong sales of sony s playstation software  as well as a full year of sales from nintendo s gamecube and microsoft s xbox which were introduced in november  and nintendo s game boy advance which was introduced in june management fees increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in management fees earned in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in game group s sales along with a more favorable currency exchange rate between the british pound and us dollar in fiscal in addition we earned  in management fees from scac in fiscal cost of goods sold increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  was partially due to a reclassification of million  or of net sales  of fiscal vendor advertising allowances from selling  general and administrative expense in connection with our change in accounting policy 
the balance of the decrease was primarily attributable to the shift in sales from lower margin hardware to higher margin software of and reduced freight costs of 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in sales of higher margin pc product accounting for 
cost of goods sold does not include purchasing and distribution center operating costs of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  which are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
accordingly  our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to the cost of goods sold of other retailers

as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to capitalized expenditures for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for new store openings  remodeling of existing stores  and capital improvements  furniture and fixtures and computer software at corporate headquarters 
in fiscal  the restructuring and asset impairment charge of million resulted from our adoption of a plan to close the operations of all eb kids stores and sell the store bc sports collectibles business 
the charge represents a million write down of store leasehold improvements  a million write down of store furniture  fixtures and equipment and million in lease termination costs
