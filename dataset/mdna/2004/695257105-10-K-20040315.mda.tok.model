executive overview business pactiv s primary business is the manufacture and sale of consumer and specialty packaging products for the consumer  foodservice food packaging  and protective and flexible packaging markets 
the company s consumer products include plastic  aluminum  and paper based products such as waste bags  food storage bags  and disposable tableware and cookware sold under such well known brand names as hefty r  baggies r  hefty r onezip r  hefty r cinchsak r  hefty r the gripper r  hefty r zoo pals r  kordite r  and ez foil r 
foodservice and food packaging products include foam  clear plastic  aluminum  pressed paperboard  and molded fibre packaging for customers in the food distribution channel  including wholesalers  supermarkets  and packer processors  who prepare and process food for consumption 
the company s protective packaging products are generally used to protect and cushion various commercial and industrial products from the point of manufacture to the point of delivery or pick up 
pactiv s flexible packaging products are used mainly in food  medical  pharmaceutical  chemical  and hygienic applications  and often involve custom design 
the company operates manufacturing facilities in countries worldwide 
pactiv generates sales and profits through the arms length sale of its products to a wide array of customers  including grocery stores  mass merchandisers  discount chains  restaurants  distributors  fabricators  and directly to end users worldwide 
costs are incurred in connection with the manufacture and sale of these products and are recorded as either cost of sales or selling  general  and administrative expenses 
approximately of pactiv s sales comes from products made from different types of plastics 
the principal raw materials used to manufacture these products are plastic resins  including polystyrene  polyethylene  polypropylene  polyvinyl chloride  and apet 
plastic resin prices can be volatile and are a function of  among other things  the availability of production capacity  oil  natural gas  and other energy related feedstock costs  and geopolitical circumstances 
the company generates cash by collecting receivables on profitable sales in a timely manner  effectively managing inventory levels  maximizing vendor payment terms  utilizing tax minimization strategies  and optimizing other elements of working capital 
pactiv uses the cash it generates to invest in property  plant  and equipment and acquisitions to provide long term sales  profit  and cash flow growth  to retire debt  and  from time to time  to repurchase its stock 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund its investing and financing activities 
pactiv has pension plans that cover substantially all of its employees 
in addition  the company  in conjunction with its spin off from tenneco inc tenneco in  became the sponsor of retirement plans covering participating employees of tenneco automotive inc whose benefits under these plans were frozen as of november   and certain former subsidiaries and affiliates of tenneco 
pactiv records net pension income on its pension plans as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses  however  management typically excludes the effects of pension income and pension assets and liabilities in assessing performance and returns of the company 
several opportunities and challenges may influence the company s continued growth 
near term risks include the impact of energy market volatility on resin costs  the ability to increase selling prices  and the continued effectiveness of the company s productivity and procurement initiatives 
longer term  the company faces potential changes in consumer demand patterns  possible supplier and customer consolidations  potential increases in foreign based competition  and possible growth in unbranded products market share 
the company expects to continue to be successful by adjusting selling prices to offset resin price movements  implementing aggressive cost management and productivity programs  leveraging its existing customer base into new distribution channels  introducing innovative new products  and making strategic acquisitions 
significant trends and other as noted above  the principal raw materials used to manufacture the company s products are plastic resins  principally polystyrene and polyethylene 
average industry prices for polystyrene were approximately higher in than in  driven principally by higher oil prices  while average industry prices for polyethylene rose by approximately in compared with  fueled by higher natural gas prices 
in response to the year over year increase in average resin costs  the company raised selling prices in many areas of its business during however  these price increases were only partially effective in offsetting the impact of the resin cost increases  as evidenced by the decline in the company s gross margin from in to in major plastic resin suppliers have announced additional price increases effective in the first quarter of  reflecting the continued volatility in energy markets 
these resin cost increases are likely to have a near term dilutive effect on the company s gross margin until resin prices fall or the company is able to raise selling prices correspondingly 
the company will implement a program in to enhance its growth through allocation of productivity savings to new product development and marketing support 
capitalizing on productivity opportunities  the company will rationalize and consolidate certain manufacturing operations 
among the actions being considered are termination of production at a molded fibre plant in great yarmouth  uk  and limited consolidation of north american operations 
these rationalizations involve asset writeoffs  equipment removal  severance  and abatement of asbestos insulation at great yarmouth 
these actions  coupled with select reductions in force and other cost reduction initiatives  are expected to reduce annualized pretax costs by approximately million million after tax 
approximately million will be redirected to additional new product development activities and marketing support 
as a result of these actions  the company plans to take an after tax charge of approximately million  of which approximately million is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of  with the balance recognized throughout the remainder of the year 
the after tax cash cost of executing the program will be approximately million 
the ultimate amount and timing of the charges will depend upon the final costs of facility closures and employee benefits  and conclusion of statutorily required discussions

critical accounting policies following are the accounting policies of pactiv that  in management s opinion  have the most significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies involve a degree of judgment and or estimation concerning inherently uncertain factors 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally considered to have occurred as products are shipped 
in arriving at net sales  the company estimates the amount of sales deductions likely to be earned or taken by customers in conjunction with incentive programs such as volume rebates  early payment discounts  and coupon redemptions 
such estimates are based on historical trends and are reviewed quarterly for possible revision 
the company believes the amount of sales deductions reflected in net sales for the months ended december   is reasonable 
in the event that future sales deduction trends vary significantly from past or expected trends  reported sales may increase or decrease by a material amount 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of inventories and at december   and  respectively is valued using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
management prefers the lifo method in that it reflects in cost of sales the current cost of the company s raw materials primarily plastic resins  which can be volatile 
if the company had valued inventories using the first in  first out fifo accounting method  net income would have been million  or per share  higher in  and would have been million  or per share  and million  or per share  lower in and  respectively 
the company s protective and flexible packaging businesses value their inventory using fifo or average cost methods 
many of these businesses are located in countries where use of the lifo method is not permitted 
management believes that the cost and complexity of using multiple inventory accounting methods in these countries would outweigh the benefits 
management periodically reviews inventory balances to identify slow moving or obsolete items 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including new product introductions  changes in consumer demand patterns  and historical usage trends 
pension plans the company accounts for pension plans in accordance with requirements of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
pension plan income million  million  and million for the months ended december    and  respectively is included in the statement of income as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
projections indicate that the company s noncash pension income will decline to approximately million in  principally reflecting the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and a one half percentage point decline from to in the discount rate used to measure pension obligations 
see exhibit attached to this form k 
pension income is based on a number of factors  including estimates of future returns on pension plan assets  amortization of actuarial gains losses  expectations regarding employee compensation  and assumptions pertaining to participant turnover  retirement age  and life expectancy 
in developing its assumption regarding the rate of return on pension plan assets  the company projects future returns on various asset classes  risk free rates of return  and long term inflation rates 
since inception in  the pension plans annual rate of return on assets has averaged 
historically  the plans have invested approximately of assets in equities and in fixed income investments 
after consideration of all of these factors  the company concluded that a rate of return on assets assumption was appropriate for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the rate of return assumption would impact the company s pension income by approximately million pretax 
the company s discount rate assumption is based on the composite yield on a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds constructed with durations to match the plans future benefit obligations approximately at september  
consequently  the company lowered its discount rate assumption for to  from in holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s pension income by approximately million pretax 
the company utilizes a market related method for calculating the value of plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets over years 
the resulting unrecognized gains or losses  along with other actuarial gains and losses  are amortized using the corridor approach outlined in sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
to manage these risks  the company  from time to time  enters into various hedging contracts in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not use hedging instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any transactions involving leveraged derivatives 
foreign currency exchange the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates  primarily related to the british pound and the euro 
associated gains or losses offset gains or losses on underlying assets or liabilities 
in managing foreign currency risk  the company aggregates existing positions and hedges residual exposures through third party derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes foreign currency forward contracts in effect at december   all of which will mature in notional amount notional amount in foreign currency exchange rate in us dollars in millions  except settlement rates euros purchase sell british pounds purchase sell czech korunas sell interest rates the company has issued public debt securities  million at december   with fixed interest rates and original maturity dates ranging from to years

in addition  the company has other fixed rate debt totaling million and floating rate debt of million at december  the following table provides information about pactiv s financial instruments that are sensitive to interest rate risks 
estimated maturity dates thereafter total dollars in millions fixed rate debt securities  average interest rate fair value  floating rate debt average interest rate fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate fair value prior to the spin off  the company entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements 
the company settled this swap in november  incurring a million loss  which is being recognized as additional interest expense over the average life of the underlying debt 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert floating rate debt on its synthetic lease obligations to fixed rate debt 
this action was taken to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
during the first quarter of  the company exited these swap agreements  and the resulting accumulated net loss million at december   is being expensed over the remaining life of the underlying obligation 
commodity derivatives during the third quarter of  the company entered into natural gas forward contracts to hedge its exposure to adverse changes in the price levels of natural gas during the period from november to march these instruments limit the upside risk on purchases of natural gas used in the production process at certain of the company s plants 
in this connection  the company paid an option premium that will be amortized over the november to march period 
the option does not obligate the company to purchase natural gas  but limits upward price exposure  while allowing the company to benefit fully from downward price movements 
changes in the market value of these natural gas hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet
