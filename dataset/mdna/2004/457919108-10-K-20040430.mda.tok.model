as a result  the information presented above is not comparative from year to year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the trust is engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties 
at january   our system included eight moderate and full service hotels with  hotel suites 
certain of our hotels are branded through franchise agreements  which include four best western hotels and one holiday inn hotel 
all eight hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants and meeting banquet room rentals 
our operations consist of only one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
we anticipate that improving economic conditions will create opportunities for the hospitality industry and our company in fiscal year improving economic conditions are expected to result in increased business and leisure travel and support high er room rates  and therefore higher operating margins 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for group business in the markets in which we operate and the trust s ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we will continue to focus on managing our costs  achieving increased daily rates in the markets where we operate and building occupancy 
we believe that our focus on customer service  adding more two room suites and leveraging technology will enable us to remain competitive 
effective february   the trust relinquished its reit status 
as of that date  any distributions to its shareholders are not deductible for purposes of computing the trust s taxable income and the trust will be subject to income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  without offset for distributions of such income to its shareholders 
see note to the trust s consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trust s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project property cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under statement of financial accounting standards no 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available  or the present value of future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
at january   the trust owned a interest in the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership 
the trust purchased   and  partnership units during the years ended january   and  respectively 
the partnership leases its hotel properties to innsuites hotels 
the corresponding rent expense for innsuites hotels and rent revenue for the partnership  as well as the resulting rent receivable and payable  eliminate in consolidation 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the partnership agreed to waive innsuites hotels accrued but unpaid rent in exchange for innsuites hotels extending its lease agreements one year 
the total amount waived was  this transaction had a net effect of increasing the trust s stockholders equity by  the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels  management and trademark fees to affiliates and hotel operating expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the percentage leases 
adr decreased by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year occupancy increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily as a result of the reduction in available rooms due to the conversion of studio suites into two room executive suites at certain of the properties  as well as the sale of certain lower occupancy properties 
this reduction in the number of suites available  combined with the hotel sales  also resulted in an increase in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions

the trust s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is its share of the partnership s cash flow 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is rent payments under the percentage leases 
innsuites hotels obligations under the percentage leases are unsecured and its ability to make rent payments to the partnership under the percentage leases  and the trust s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to its shareholders  will depend upon the ability of innsuites hotels to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
historically  as a reit  the trust was required to distribute to its shareholders at least of its taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
the termination of the trust s status as a reit  effective february   eliminated this requirement

see note to the trust s consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
as of january   the trust has no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements that is set aside annually  as described below 
the partnership continues to contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund  from the rent paid under the percentage leases  an amount equal to of innsuites hotels revenues from operation of the hotels

the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment  in addition to other uses of amounts in the fund considered appropriate from time to time 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
the trust considers the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts have been capitalized and are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the trust plans to spend approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year innsuites hotels also spent approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
on february   the trust purchased  class b limited partnership units in the partnership from mr 
wirth and his affiliates for the closing price of the trust s shares of beneficial interest on that day  which was 
the trust made a down payment totaling  and issued five promissory notes totaling  which will be paid in monthly installments of principal and interest over months 
the trust repurchased these units to increase its sole general partner interest in the partnership  and thereby receive a larger allocation of the partnership s equity 
this increased allocation of equity will enhance the trust s ability to regain compliance with american stock exchange listing requirements 
the trust has minimum debt payments of million and million due during fiscal years and  respectively 
the sale of the tempe  arizona property subsequent to year end satisfied in full the mortgage note secured by that property  which accounted for million of the principal due in fiscal year  as well as million and million of the principal due to mr

if revenue generated from operations is insufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they come due  payments and terms for obligations owed to mr 
wirth and his affiliates in the amounts of million and million due in and  respectively  may be renegotiated to extend the terms of these loans 
mr 
wirth and or his affiliates have also demonstrated their willingness to modify the terms of existing obligations and to create new obligations based on the cash needs of the trust 
see note to the trust s consolidated financial statements notes and advances payable to related parties 
management believes that cash on hand  future cash receipts from operations  proceeds from hotel sales and borrowings from affiliates in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
the trust may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the trust may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as the trust considers prudent 
the trust will acquire or develop additional hotels only as suitable opportunities arise  and the trust will not undertake acquisition or redevelopment of properties unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of shares of beneficial interest or other securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the trust will successfully acquire or develop additional hotels or that proceeds from borrowings or issuances of shares of beneficial interest will be available or in amounts and on terms sufficient to allow such transactions 
continued listing with the american stock exchange on june   the trust received a notice from the american stock exchange amex indicating that the trust failed to meet certain of amex s continued listing standards as set forth under section a of the amex company guide 
the trust became non compliant with amex s listing standards due to losses incurred in the most recent fiscal years 
these losses were exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september   the war in iraq during the spring of  as well as the general slowdown in the economy and travel 
in response to this notice  the trust was given the opportunity to submit a plan to amex to regain compliance with the continued listing standards 
on august   amex notified the trust that it accepted the trust s plan and granted the trust an extension of time to november to regain compliance with the continued listing standards 
the trust will be subject to periodic review by amex staff during this extension period 
failure to make progress consistent with the plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the extension period could result in the trust being delisted from amex 
if the trust s shares of beneficial interest were delisted from amex  liquidity in the trading market for the shares of beneficial interest could be significantly decreased  which could reduce the trading price of and increase the transaction costs of trading shares of beneficial interest 
as part of the trust s plan  the trust has taken certain steps to reduce expenses and increase sales  which has positioned the trust to improve its operating results 
in addition  the trust recently sold three non strategic assets  its scottsdale and flagstaff  arizona and buena park  california properties  allowing it to reduce operating losses and fully satisfy its bank term loan and bank line of credit

critical accounting policies and estimates the trust believes that the policies it follows for the valuation of its hotel properties  which constitute the majority of trust assets  are its most critical policies 
the trust applies sfas no 
to determine when it is necessary to test an asset for recoverability 
on an events and circumstances basis  the trust reviews the carrying value of its hotel properties both held for use and held for sale 
the trust will record an impairment loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and or a current appraisal of the property do not support its carrying value 
in cases where the trust does not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for use  it will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel  as determined by a current appraisal 
in cases where the trust does not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for sale  it will reduce the carrying value to the sales price less costs to sell 
for the twelve months ended january  and  the trust recorded impairment losses of  and  respectively 
the trust did not recognize impairment expense in fiscal year as of january   the trust management does not believe that the carrying values of any of its hotel properties are impaired 
accounting matters in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  which was subsequently amended by fin r 
this interpretation requires an existing unconsolidated variable interest entity to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risk among all parties involved or if other parties do not have significant capital to finance activities without subordinated financial support from the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
this interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after december  and no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  for interests in variable interest entities that were acquired prior to february  while management has not yet completed its evaluation of the requirements of fin r  management believes it is probable the trust will consolidate  or be required to provide certain additional disclosures with respect to  the management company and the licensing corp 
when fin r becomes effective 
subsequent to year end  the trust entered into negotiations to purchase its management and trademark agreements from the management company and the licensing corp 
inflation the trust s revenue is based on the underlying hotel revenue 
therefore  the trust relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and innsuites hotels in particular  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates faster than inflation

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of january  and does not consider those exposures or positions which would arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the trust s interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during any particular period and future interest rates
