such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties more particularly described in item of this report  under the caption risk factors 
these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following information is provided to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
general our principal business objective is to generate income for distribution to our unitholders from the transportation of natural gas through our gathering systems 
our gathering systems gather natural gas from wells in eastern ohio  western new york  and western pennsylvania and transport the natural gas primarily to public utility pipelines 
to a lesser extent  the gathering systems transport natural gas to end users 
in may  we completed a public offering of  common units of limited partner interest 
the net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions were approximately million 
these proceeds were used in part to repay existing indebtedness of million 
we intend to use the balance of these proceeds to fund future capital projects and for working capital 
in september  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with semco under which we or our designee will purchase all of the outstanding equity of semco s wholly owned subsidiary  alaska pipeline  llc  which owns a mile intrastate natural gas transmission pipeline that delivers gas to metropolitan anchorage 
the total consideration  payable in cash at closing  will be approximately million  subject to an adjustment based on the amount of working capital that alaska pipeline has at closing 
completion of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions  including receipt of governmental and non governmental consents and approvals and the absence of a material adverse change in alaska pipeline s business 
among the required governmental authorizations are approval of the regulatory commission of alaska and expiration  without adverse action  of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act 
we received an early termination of the hart scott rodino waiting period in january the purchase and sale agreement may be terminated by either semco or us if the transaction is not completed by june  results of operations in the years ended december   and  our principal revenues came from the operation of our pipeline gathering systems which transport and compress natural gas 
two variables which affect our transportation revenues are o the volumes of natural gas transported by us which  in turn  depend upon the number of wells connected to our gathering system  the amount of natural gas they produce  and the demand for that natural gas  and o the transportation fees paid to us which  in turn  depend upon the price of the natural gas we transport  which itself is a function of the relevant supply and demand in the mid atlantic and northeastern areas of the united states 
we set forth the average volumes we transported  our average transportation rates per mcf and revenues received by us for the periods indicated in the following table for the years ended december  average daily throughput volumes  in mcf    average transportation rate per mcf 


total transportation and compression revenues    year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our transportation and compression revenues increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this increase of  resulted from an increase in the average transportation rate paid to us  and an increase in the volumes of natural gas we transported 
our transportation rate was 
per mcf in the year ended december  as compared to 
per mcf in the year ended december   an increase of 
per mcf 
during the year ended december   natural gas prices increased significantly over the year ended december  since our transportation rates are generally at fixed percentages of the sale prices of the natural gas we transport  the higher prices resulted in an increase in our average transportation rate 
our average daily throughput volumes were  mcfs in the year ended december  as compared to  mcfs in the year ended december   an increase of  mcfs 
the increase in the average daily throughput volume resulted principally from volumes associated with new wells added to our pipeline system  we turned on line and wells in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by the natural decline in production volumes from existing wells connected to our gathering systems 
costs and expenses 
our transportation and compression expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
our average cost per mcf of transportation and compression increased to 
in the year ended december  as compared to 
in the year ended december   an increase of 

this increase resulted primarily from an increase in compressor expenses due to the addition of more compressors and increased lease rates for our compressors 
however  during  we have substantially completed the process of purchasing several compressors which we previously leased 
we anticipate this will reduce future compressor expenses on a per mcf basis 
our general and administrative expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase primarily resulted from an increase of  in allocations of compensation and benefits from atlas america and its affiliates due to an increase in management time spent during the year on acquisitions  potential acquisitions and our public offering 
this increase was largely offset by a decrease in professional fees which  in the prior period  had been higher than normal due to costs associated with the proposed acquisition of triton coal company 
we were also reimbursed  by atlas america in the current year for one half of our unreimbursed costs associated with the proposed triton acquisition 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase resulted from our increased asset base associated with pipeline extensions and compressor upgrades and purchases 
we anticipate that our depreciation expense will increase in as a result of our pipeline extensions and compressor upgrades 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our transportation revenue decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this decrease of  resulted from a decrease in the average transportation rate paid to us  partially offset by an increase in the volumes of natural gas we transported 
our average daily throughput volumes were  mcfs in the year ended december  as compared to  mcfs in the year ended december   an increase of  mcfs 
the increase in the average daily throughput volume resulted principally from volumes associated with new wells added to our pipeline system  we turned on line and wells in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by the natural decline in production volumes inherent in the life of a well 
our average transportation rate was 
per mcf in the year ended december  as compared to 
per mcf in the year ended december   a decrease of 
per mcf 
the decrease in our average transportation rate resulted from the decrease in the average natural gas price received by producers for gas transported through our pipeline system 
costs and expenses 
our transportation and compression expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of   principally due to the increased volumes of natural gas we transported in our average cost per mcf of transportation and compression was 
in both the years ended december  and our general and administrative expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase primarily resulted from professional fees of  incurred in connection with the terminated triton transaction see note to our consolidated financial statements and our cost of insurance  reflecting increased operating activities and assets  as well as significant increases in insurance rates in general 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase resulted from the increased asset base associated with pipeline extensions and acquisitions partially offset by a reduction in goodwill amortization as compared to the previous period due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
on january  our interest expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december  this increase of  resulted primarily from the write off of deferred finance fees of  relating to our former credit facility with pnc bank  which we paid off upon obtaining our current credit facility with wachovia bank 
in addition  we had an increase in the amount of funds borrowed due to an increase in pipeline extensions 
these increases were partially offset by lower borrowing rates 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are for debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our unitholders and general partner 
in addition to cash generated from operations  we have the ability to meet our cash requirements  other than distributions to our unitholders and general partner  through borrowings under our credit facility 
in general  we expect to fund o cash distributions and maintenance capital expenditures through existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  o expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits through the retention of cash and additional borrowings  o debt principal payments through additional borrowings as they become due or by the issuance of additional common units 
in september we entered into an agreement to purchase alaska pipeline  llc  subject to certain conditions  principally the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act and the approval of the regulatory commission of alaska 
we received an early termination of the hart scott rodino waiting period in january we discuss this transaction and its potential effects on our liquidity and capital resources in pending acquisition 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings and million of remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
the following table summarizes our financial condition and liquidity at the dates indicated at december  current ratio x x x working capital in thousands   ratio of long term debt to total partners capital n a 
x 
x net cash provided by operations of  in the year ended december  increased  from  in the year ended december  the increase derived principally from income from operations and changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
net income before depreciation and amortization was  in the year ended december   an increase of  from the year ended december  this increase was principally due to the increase in the average transportation rate we received in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   our accounts payable affiliates increased as a result of advances from atlas america in connection with expenses associated with the pending acquisition of alaska pipeline 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   an increase of  from  in the year ended december  the reason for this increase was an increase in expenditures related to gathering system extensions and compressor upgrades to accommodate new wells drilled by atlas america and its affiliates and expenditures of  associated with our pending acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   an increase of  from cash used in financing activities of  in the year ended december  the principal reason for the increase was the completion of our public offering in may  which provided net cash of  after repayment of our outstanding indebtedness and the receipt of a  capital contribution from our general partner 
offsetting this increase was an increase in distributions of  and cash spent on other assets as a result of financing costs associated with obtaining a new credit facility 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves  including any reserves required under debt instruments for future principal and interest payments 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when our general partner determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner if quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed specified targets  as described in item of this report 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate amount of cash being distributed 
the general partner s incentive distribution for year ended december  was  capital expenditures our property and equipment was approximately and of our total consolidated assets at december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  other than the acquisitions of gathering systems  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures principally consisted of costs relating to the expansion of our existing gathering systems to accommodate new wells drilled in our service area and compressor upgrades 
during  we connected wells to our gathering system 
as of december   we were committed to expend approximately  in connection with our decision to purchase our compressors rather than lease them and approximately  on pipeline extensions 
in addition  we anticipate capital expenditures of million in for maintenance and expansion associated with alaska pipeline  our pending acquisition 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase in as a result of an increase in the estimated number of well connections to our gathering systems 
pending acquisition as described in item  business  and in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have agreed to acquire alaska pipeline for million 
we anticipate incurring approximately million in costs in connection with the transaction 
the acquisition is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  principally approval of the transaction by the regulatory commission of alaska and the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act 
we received an early termination of the hart scott rodino waiting period in january we intend to fund the acquisition price and expenses as follows o we will borrow all of the million available under our existing credit facility 
we will use this amount  plus million of advances from our general partner  to make a common equity contribution to apc acquisition  the newly formed entity that will acquire alaska pipeline company  llc o friedman  billings  ramsey group  inc has committed to make a million preferred equity contribution in apc acquisition 
o apc acquisition has received a commitment for a million credit facility to be administered by wachovia bank 
it will borrow million under this facility 
we anticipate that we will repay the equity financing from friedman  billings  ramsey group and some portion of either or both of the wachovia bank credit facilities with the proceeds of an offering of common units 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to complete the anticipated offering 
if we do not  then the equity and debt financings will continue 
while the continuation of these financings will reduce our capacity for further borrowing and reduce the amount of cash from operations that would otherwise be available to us from the combination of our operations with those of alaska pipeline company  we believe that our remaining liquidity and capital resources would be sufficient to meet our post acquisition operational needs 
inflation and changes in prices inflation affects the operating expenses of our gathering systems 
increases in those expenses are not necessarily offset by increases in transportation fees that the gathering operations are able to charge 
we have not been materially affected by inflation because we were formed relatively recently and have only a limited period of operations 
while we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs  we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects 
in addition  the value of our gathering systems has been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas prices 
natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations which we are unable to control or accurately predict 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety 
we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of remedial requirements  and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance or other mandatory or consensual measures 
we have an ongoing environmental compliance program 
however  risks of accidental leaks or spills are associated with the transportation of natural gas 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities relating to claims for damages to property  the environment  natural resources  or persons resulting from the operation of our business 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  could result in increased costs and liabilities to us 
environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last years  and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 
one trend in environmental regulation is to increase reporting obligations and place more restrictions and limitations on activities  such as emissions of pollutants  generation and disposal of wastes and use  storage and handling of chemical substances  that may impact human health  the environment and or endangered species 
increasingly strict environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the united states 
it is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase 
we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly  but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such charge  or that our efforts will prevent material costs  if any  from arising 
long term debt we increased our credit facility to million in september our principal purpose in obtaining the increase in the facility was to enable us to fund our pending acquisition of alaska pipeline company and acquisitions of other gas gathering systems 
in may we used proceeds from our public offering to repay our existing indebtedness of million under the facility 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations less than after total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations    amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments less than after total year years years years lines of credit standby letter of credit guarantees standby replacement commitments other commercial commitments   total commercial commitments   other commercial commitments relate to commitments to purchase compressors which we had been leasing and for expenditures for pipeline extensions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
key estimates used by our management include estimates used to record revenue and expense accruals  depreciation and amortization  asset impairment and fair values of assets acquired 
we summarize our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we discuss below the critical accounting policies that we have identified 
revenue and expenses we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of receiving information from third parties and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
we have determined these estimates using available market data and valuation methodologies 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but cannot assure you that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
depreciation and amortization we calculate our depreciation based on the estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
however  factors such as usage  equipment failure  competition  regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
impairment of assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we determine if our long lived assets are impaired by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets with the estimated future cash flows associated with such asset or group of assets 
if the carrying amount is greater than the estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess  if any 
our gathering systems are subject to numerous factors which could affect future cash flows which we discuss in item  business risk factors 
we continuously monitor these factors and pursue alternative strategies to maintain or enhance cash flows associated with these assets  however  we cannot assure you that we can mitigate the effects  if any  on future cash flows related to any changes in these factors 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill  all of which relates to our acquisition of pipeline assets 
we test our goodwill for impairment at each year end by comparing fair values to our carrying values 
the evaluation of impairment under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations  including anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and the discount factor used 
actual results could differ from projections resulting in revisions to our assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
our test during the current year resulted in no impairment 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill at least annually and will reflect the impairment of goodwill  if any  in operating income in the income statement in the period in which the impairment is indicated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have exposure to currency exchange risks 
we do not engage in any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions  and as a result  we do not have exposure to derivatives risk 
our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to natural gas sales 
realized pricing is primarily driven by spot market prices for natural gas 
pricing for natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
market risk inherent in our debt is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates 
changes in interest rates usually do not affect the fair value of variable rate debt  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows
