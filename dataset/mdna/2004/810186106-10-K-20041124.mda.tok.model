item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
smith hawken effective october   scotts acquired smith hawken  a leading brand in the fast growing outdoor living and gardening lifestyle category 
smith hawken products  which include high end outdoor furniture  pottery  garden tools  gardening containers and live goods  are sold in the united states through its retail stores  as well as through catalog and internet sales 
for further details concerning the acquisition of this business  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
research and development we believe strongly in the benefits of research and development  and we continually invest in research and development to improve existing or develop new products  manufacturing processes and packaging and delivery systems 
our spending on research and development approximated million  million  and million of net sales in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
our research and development spending included million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively  related to environmental and regulatory expenses 
we believe that our long standing commitment to innovation has benefited us  as evidenced by a portfolio of patents worldwide that support many of our fertilizers  grass seeds and application devices 
in addition to the benefits of our own research and development  we benefit from the research and development activities of our suppliers 
our research and development worldwide headquarters is located at the dwight g 
scott research center in marysville  ohio 
we also have research and development facilities in levington  the united kingdom  chazay  france  heerlen  the netherlands and sydney  australia  as well as several research field stations located throughout the united states 
biotechnology we believe that the development and commercialization of innovative products is an important key to our continued success 
we have a long history of dedication to responsible research in search of more effective and easier to use products  that are preferred by consumers and are better for the environment 
in particular  we have worked for over years to create better products for the establishment and maintenance of turfgrass 
plant breeding has been a part of that research and development for the past years 
we remain dedicated to being the technology leader in turfgrass products 
today  that dedication results in research into products that can be enhanced  not only with traditional plant breeding  but also with proven agricultural biotechnology 
this research offers the long term promise of grasses that require less maintenance  less water  and are even better for the environment 
before a product enhanced with biotechnology may be sold in the united states  it must be deregulated by appropriate governmental agencies 
deregulation involves compliance with the rules and regulations of  and cooperation with  the united states department of agriculture  animal and plant health inspection service the usda  the united states environmental protection agency the us epa and or the food and drug administration the fda 
therefore  any enhanced product for which we seek commercialization through submission of a petition for deregulation will be subjected to rigorous and thorough governmental regulatory review 
more specifically  as part of the deregulation process for any product enhanced with biotechnology  we are required to present evidence to the usda in the form of scientifically rigorous studies showing that the product poses no additional toxicological or ecological risk than products of the same species that have not been enhanced with biotechnology 
we are also required to satisfy other agencies  such as the us epa and the fda  as to their appropriate areas of regulatory authority 
this process typically takes years to complete and also includes at least two opportunities for public comment 
we submitted a petition for deregulation of a non residential turfgrass product enhanced with biotechnology to the usda on april  this turfgrass has been shown  through our research trials  to provide simple  more flexible and better weed control for golf courses in a manner that we believe is more environmentally friendly 
the usda requested additional information and data 
we determined that it was more expedient to withdraw the petition and submit a revised petition that addressed the usda s requests than to amend the current petition 
on october   we withdrew our petition 
we prepared a revised petition that addresses the usda s requests and submitted it on april  the usda has a variety of options in adjudicating a petition to deregulate a biotechnology derived plant product 
the usda has decided to employ the formal environmental impact statement eis process to judge the acceptability of our petition for deregulation 
scotts welcomes this process as the most thorough evaluative step available to the usda 
there can be no assurance that our petition for deregulation of this turfgrass product enhanced with biotechnology will be approved  or that if approved and commercially introduced  it will generate any revenues or contribute to our earnings 
trademarks  patents and licenses the scotts  miracle gro  hyponex  smith hawken and ortho brand names and logos  as well as a number of product trademarks  including turf builder  osmocote and peters  are federally and or internationally registered and are considered material to our business 
we regularly monitor our trademark registrations  which are generally effective for ten years  so that we can renew those nearing expiration 
as of september   we held issued patents in the united states covering fertilizer  chemical and growing media compositions and processes  grass varieties  and applicator and sprayer devices 
many of these patents have also been issued internationally  bringing our total worldwide patent portfolio to united states and international patents provide patent protection generally extending to years from the date of filing  subject to the payment of applicable governmental maintenance and annuity fees 
accordingly  many of our patents will extend well into the next decade 
in addition  we continue to file new patent applications each year 
currently  we have pending patent applications worldwide 
we also hold exclusive and non exclusive patent licenses from various raw material suppliers  permitting the use and sale of additional patented fertilizers and pesticides 
during fiscal  we were granted three united states and international patents 
the new us patents cover coated fertilizers that are specifically formulated to act as starter fertilizers for new plantings  coated fertilizers having coatings that can be triggered to begin nutrient release at specific times and growing media prepared from surfactants mixed with coir material to provide controlled nutrient release characteristics 
internationally  we continue to extend patent coverage of our core fertilizer technologies including controlled release and water soluble products 
we also are extending protection of our developments in regard to aquaculture  growing media  applicator and sprayer technologies to additional countries within our canadian  european and asia pacific markets 
significant accomplishments are the extension of our coir peat international patent coverage  our grasshopper applicator products within the european markets  our pull n spray sprayer in new zealand and additional coverage of our ortho applicator technology in both canada and japan 
two patents are scheduled to expire in fiscal the loss of these patents is not expected to materially affect the business 
we have one patent currently being opposed by a third party in europe 
in regard to this opposed patent  the european patent office epo earlier in calendar year rendered a favorable decision 
however  the opposing party has appealed that decision 
a ruling on the appeal is not expected until calendar year an unfavorable ruling by the epo in the appeal could materially affect our indoor pest control market share in germany 
roundup marketing agreement on september   we entered into a marketing agreement with monsanto and became monsanto s exclusive agent for the marketing and distribution of consumer roundup products with additional rights to new products containing glyphosate or other similar non selective herbicides in the consumer lawn and garden market within the united states and other specified countries  including australia  austria  canada  france  germany and the united kingdom 
under the marketing agreement  we and monsanto are jointly responsible for developing global consumer and trade marketing programs for consumer roundup 
we have assumed responsibility for sales support  merchandising  distribution and logistics for roundup 
monsanto continues to own the consumer roundup business and provides significant oversight of its brand 
in addition  monsanto continues to own and operate the agricultural roundup business 
we are compensated under the marketing agreement based on the success of the consumer roundup business in the markets covered by the agreement 
we receive a graduated commission to the extent that the earnings before interest and taxes of the consumer roundup business in the included markets exceed specified thresholds 
regardless of these earnings  we are required to make an annual contribution payment against the overall expenses of the roundup business 
for fiscal  and until or the earlier termination of the agreement  the minimum annual contribution payment is million and may be higher if certain significant earnings targets are achieved 
our net commission under the marketing agreement is equal to the graduated commission amount described above  less the applicable contribution payment and amortization of the marketing rights advance payment 
for fiscal and fiscal  the net commission was million and million  respectively 
for further details  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the marketing agreement has no definite term  except as it relates to the european union countries 
with respect to the european union countries  the initial term of the marketing agreement extends through september  the parties may agree to renew the agreement with respect to the european union countries for three successive terms ending on september   and  with a separate determination being made by the parties at least six months prior to the expiration of each such term as to whether to commence a subsequent renewal term 
however  if monsanto does not agree to any of the renewal terms with respect to the european union countries  the commission structure will be recalculated in a manner likely to be favorable to us 
monsanto has the right to terminate the marketing agreement upon certain specified events of default by scotts  including an uncured material breach  material fraud  material misconduct or egregious injury to the roundup brand 
monsanto also has the right to terminate the agreement upon a change of control of monsanto or the sale of the consumer roundup business 
in addition  monsanto may terminate the agreement within specified regions  including north america  for specified declines in the consumer roundup business 
we have rights similar to monsanto s to terminate the marketing agreement upon an uncured material breach  material fraud or material willful misconduct by monsanto 
in addition  we may terminate the agreement upon monsanto s sale of the consumer roundup business or in certain other circumstances  in which case we would not be able to collect the termination fee described below 
if monsanto terminates the marketing agreement upon a change of control of monsanto or the sale of the consumer roundup business prior to september   we will be entitled to a termination fee in excess of million 
if we terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach  material fraud or material willful misconduct by monsanto  we will be entitled to receive a termination fee in excess of million if the termination occurs prior to september  the termination fee declines over time from in excess of million to a minimum of million for terminations between september  and september  monsanto has agreed to provide us with notice of any proposed sale of the consumer roundup business  allow us to participate in the sale process and negotiate in good faith with us with respect to a sale 
in the event that we acquire the consumer roundup business in such a sale  we would receive credit against the purchase price in the amount of the termination fee that would otherwise have been paid to us upon termination by monsanto of the marketing agreement upon the sale 
if monsanto decides to sell the consumer roundup business to another party  we must let monsanto know whether we intend to terminate the marketing agreement and forfeit any right to a termination fee or whether we will agree to continue to perform under the agreement on behalf of the purchaser  unless and until the purchaser terminates our services and pays any applicable termination fee 
competition each of our segments participates in markets that are highly competitive 
many of our competitors sell their products at prices lower than ours  and we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  product performance  supply chain efficiencies  value  brand strength and advertising 
in the north american consumer do it yourself lawn and garden markets and pest control markets  we compete primarily against control label products as well as branded products 
control label products are those sold under a retailer owned label or a supplier owned label  which are sold exclusively at a specific retail chain 
the control label products that we compete with include vigoro products sold at home depot  sta green products sold at lowe s  and kgro products sold at kmart 
our competitors in branded lawn and garden products and the consumer pest control markets include united industries corporation  bayer ag  central garden pet company  garden tech  enforcer products  inc  green light company and lebanon chemical corp 
with respect to growing media products  in addition to nationally distributed  branded competitive products  we face competition from regional competitors who compete primarily on the basis of price for commodity growing media business 
in the north american professional horticulture markets  we face a broad range of competition from numerous companies ranging in size from multi national chemical and fertilizer companies such as dow agrosciences company  uniroyal chemical corporation and chisso asahi fertilizer co 
ltd  to smaller  specialized companies such as pursell technologies  inc  sun gro us a division of hines horticulture  inc and fafard  inc 
some of these competitors have significant financial resources and research departments 
trugreen chemlawn  a division of servicemaster  has the leading market share in the us lawn care service market and has a substantially larger share of this market than scotts lawnservice 
the international professional horticulture markets in which we compete are also very competitive  particularly the markets for controlled release and water soluble fertilizer products 
we have numerous us and european competitors in these international markets  including pursell industries  inc  compo gmbh  a subsidiary of kali salz  norsk hydro asa  haifa chemicals ltd 
and kemira oyj 
we also face competition from control label products 
internationally  we face strong competition in the consumer do it yourself lawn and garden market  particularly in europe 
our competitors in the european union include bayer ag  kali salz compo  algoflash brands and a variety of local companies 
significant customers approximately of our worldwide net sales in fiscal were made by our north america segment 
within the north america segment  approximately of our net sales in fiscal were made to home depot  to wal mart and to lowe s 
we face strong competition for the business of these significant customers 
the loss of any of these customers or a substantial decrease in the volume or profitability of our business with any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and profits 
strategic initiatives international profit improvement plan in august  we announced an initiative to reduce costs and improve the profitability of our european consumer and professional businesses 
the original plan called for an investment of between million and million in these businesses by the end of we now expect to invest between million and million over this time frame by leveraging high value  lower risk initiatives to drive significant improvement in the profitability of these businesses 
approximately of the expected investment is for capital expenditures  primarily for the installation of an enterprise resource planning erp system in our largest european operations france  germany and the united kingdom 
the project also involves reorganization and rationalization of our european supply chain  increased sales force productivity and a shift to pan european category management of our product portfolio that will constitute approximately of the expected investment 
as part of this initiative  restructuring and other charges will be incurred at various times 
under the plan  profitability has improved  but the international business continues to perform below expectations 
as such  we are exploring all of our options for the international business  with the goal of improving shareholder value 
for further information concerning the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal years  and  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
developing strong relationships with key retailers we believe that our leading brands and our industry leading media advertising make our products traffic builders at retail locations 
in addition  we believe our leading full line of branded consumer lawn and garden products gives us an advantage in selling to retailers who value the efficiency of dealing with a limited number of suppliers 
we have made significant investments in the past few years to establish business development teams at home depot  wal mart  lowe s and at other national accounts to work with their buyers and supply chain management to maximize mutual sales opportunities and improve the efficient distribution of products 
in addition  we serve as the lawn and garden category advisor for wal mart and kmart 
we are also the largest supplier of consumer lawn and garden products to the hardware co op channel 
enhancing market leadership through consumer focused brand management we intend to continue to execute our successful marketing strategies used to strengthen our leading market positions 
in fiscal  we invested approximately million on advertising which we believe is better targeted to our key consumer audience and focused on scotts product superiority 
we believe that our approach to marketing  which balances consumer directed advertising eg prime time television spots  direct mail and internet marketing with retailer oriented promotions  builds brand awareness and drives product sales growth 
we have grown sales  increased market share and expanded the lawn and garden category over the past five years through successful execution of this strategy for our four principal brands scotts  miracle gro  ortho and roundup 
we market and distribute roundup products exclusively to the consumer lawn and garden market in the united states and certain other countries on behalf of monsanto 
our strategy is to grow the overall consumer lawn and garden category and to capture substantially all of this growth 
pursuing attractive growth initiatives we believe that the power of our brands provides us with significant opportunities to expand our business into adjacent lawn and garden categories 
to pursue these opportunities  at the end of fiscal  we created a new business development group within north america 
this group has focused on extending scotts brands into adjacent consumer lawn and garden categories that are currently not characterized by branded  value added products 
the group is also responsible for developing underdeveloped sales channels  such as grocery and drug stores  and improving our business with independent retailers through a combination of tailored programs and unique products or packaging 
in fiscal  we acquired two pottery distribution companies and are finalizing plans to introduce a value added line of pottery products with a highly efficient distribution model  first in the southeastern united states with a major retailer  and later on a national basis 
in october  we acquired smith hawken  a leading brand in the fast growing outdoor living and gardening lifestyle category 
the addition of the smith hawken brand and its network of retail stores  catalog and internet sales will be the foundation for our future expansion into outdoor living as we look to expand into adjacent lawn and garden categories 
expanding scotts lawnservice the number of lawn owners who want to maintain their lawns and gardens but do not want to do it themselves represents a significant portion of the total market 
we recognize that our portfolio of well known brands provides us with a unique ability to extend our brands into the lawn and garden service business 
we believe that the strength of our brands provides us with a significant competitive advantage in acquiring new customers and we have spent the past several years developing our scotts lawnservice business model 
the business has grown significantly from revenues of approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal the majority of this growth has been fueled by geographic expansion  acquisitions and organic growth fueled by our highly effective direct marketing programs 
we invested approximately million of capital in lawn service acquisitions in fiscal  down considerably from investment levels in prior years 
in addition  we invested approximately million to buy out the minority owners in the scotts lawnservice business 
we anticipate continuing to make selective acquisitions in fiscal and beyond 
significant investments will continue to be made in our scotts lawnservice business infrastructure with the focus being to continually improve our customer service throughout the organization 
supply chain excellence over the past several years  we have focused on building world class manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
we have successfully developed this expertise through both significant investments and incorporation of supply chain related metrics into our key business and incentive measures 
we have invested  and continue to invest  in systems to allow us to better capture and analyze supply chain information 
for instance  in fiscal  we completed implementation of the erp software system for our north american businesses at a cost of approximately million 
more recently we  as part of our profit improvement plan for international  have installed the erp software system at our major foreign locations 
this level of investment and focus has allowed us to develop what we believe is a significant competitive advantage in serving our retail customers 
we have significantly improved customer service rates which  coupled with more closely tying shipments to when the consumer purchases scotts products from the retail shelf  has allowed our customers to improve inventory turns and reduce average inventory levels 
the investments we have made in our production facilities have improved manufacturing flexibility  allowing us to improve our inventory turns and reduce our average inventory levels as well 
seasonality and backlog our business is highly seasonal with approximately of our net sales occurring in our combined second and third quarters of both fiscal and fiscal consistent with prior years  we anticipate that significant orders for the upcoming spring season will start to be received late in the winter and continue through the spring season 
historically  substantially all orders are received and shipped within the same fiscal year with minimal carryover of open orders at the end of the fiscal year 
raw materials we purchase raw materials for our products from various sources that we presently consider to be adequate  and no one source is considered essential to any of our segments or to our business as a whole 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials  including urea and other chemicals as well as paper and plastic products 
our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply and to minimize costs 
we seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors 
we do not enter into forward contracts or other market instruments as a means of minimizing our risk exposures on these materials but  when appropriate  we will procure a certain percentage of our needs in advance of the season to secure pre determined prices 
manufacturing and distribution we manufacture products for our north american consumer business at our facilities in marysville  ohio  ft 
madison  iowa and temecula  california  as well as use a number of third party contract packers in the united states and canada 
in addition  the company manufactures growing media products in regional facilities located throughout the united states 
the primary distribution centers for our north american consumer business are managed by scotts and strategically placed across the united states 
we also manufacture horticultural products for our north america and international professional businesses at a leased fertilizer manufacturing facility in charleston  south carolina and a company owned site in heerlen  the netherlands 
certain products are also produced for our professional businesses at other company owned facilities and subcontractors in the united states and europe 
the majority of shipments to customers are made via common carriers through distributors in the united states and a network of public warehouses and distributors in europe 
we manufacture the non growing media products for our international business at our facilities in howden  the united kingdom and bourth  france  as well as use a number of third party contract packers 
the primary distribution centers for our international businesses are located in the united kingdom  france and germany and are managed by a logistics provider 
the growing media products for our international segment are produced at our facilities in hatfield  the united kingdom and hautmont  france and at a number of third party contract packers 
growing media products are generally shipped direct without passing through either a distribution center or mixing warehouse 
employees as of september   we employed  full time employees in the united states and an additional  full time employees located outside the united states 
during peak sales and production periods  we utilize seasonal and temporary labor 
none of our us employees are members of a union 
approximately of our full time uk employees are members of the transport and general workers union and have full collective bargaining rights 
an undisclosed number of our full time employees at our office in ecully  france are members of the confederation francaise democratique du travail and confederation generale du travail  participation in which is confidential under french law 
in addition  a number of union and non union full time employees are members of works councils at three sites in bourth  hautmont and ecully  france  and a number of non union employees are members of works councils in ingelheim  germany 
in the waardenburg office in the netherlands  a small number of the approximately employees are members of a workers union  but we are not responsible for collective bargaining negotiations with this union 
in the netherlands  we are governed by the works councils act with respect to the union 
works councils represent employees on labor  employment matters and manage social benefits 
we believe we have good relationships with our employees  both unionized and non unionized  in the united states and internationally 
environmental and regulatory considerations local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways 
in the united states  all products containing pesticides must be registered with the us epa and similar state agencies before they can be sold 
the inability to obtain or the cancellation of any such registration could have an adverse effect on our business  the severity of which would depend on the products involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute active ingredients  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
fertilizer and growing media products are also subject to state and foreign labeling regulations 
our manufacturing operations are subject to waste  water and air quality permitting and other regulatory requirements of federal and state agencies 
the food quality protection act  enacted by the us congress in august  establishes a standard for food use pesticides  which standard is the reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effects of pesticide exposures 
under this act  the us epa is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in our products  certain of which may be used on crops processed into various food products  are typically manufactured by independent third parties and continue to be evaluated by the us epa as part of this exposure risk assessment 
the us epa or the third party registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us 
we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of these continuing evaluations 
in addition  the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local  state  federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies 
these regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations such as not for use on sod farms or golf courses  may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied  may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients 
we believe that we are operating in substantial compliance with  or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  these laws and regulations 
state and federal authorities generally require growing media facilities to obtain permits sometimes on an annual basis in order to harvest peat and to discharge storm water run off or water pumped from peat deposits 
the state permits typically specify the condition in which the property must be left after the peat is fully harvested  with the residual use typically being natural wetland habitats combined with open water areas 
we are generally required by these permits to limit our harvesting and to restore the property consistent with the intended residual use 
in some locations  these facilities have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water 
regulations and environmental concerns also exist surrounding peat extraction in the united kingdom and the european union 
in august  english nature  the nature conservation advisory body to the united kingdom government  notified us that three of our peat harvesting sites in the united kingdom were under consideration as possible special areas of conservation under european union law 
in april  working in conjunction with friends of the earth united kingdom  we reached agreement with english nature to transfer our interests in the properties and for the immediate cessation of all but a limited amount of peat extraction on one of the three sites 
as a result of this agreement  we have withdrawn our objection to the proposed european designations as special areas of conservation and will undertake restoration work on the sites  for which we will receive additional consideration from english nature 
we believe that we have sufficient raw material supplies available to replace the peat extracted from such sites 
regulatory actions in june  the ohio environmental protection agency the ohio epa initiated an enforcement action against us with respect to alleged surface water violations and inadequate treatment capabilities at our marysville  ohio facility and seeking corrective action under the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
the action relates to several discontinued on site disposal areas which date back to the early operations of the marysville facility that we had already been assessing and  in some cases  remediating  on a voluntary basis 
on december   an agreed judicial consent order was submitted to the union county common pleas court and was entered by the court on january  now that the consent order has been entered  we have paid a  fine and must satisfactorily remediate the marysville site 
we have continued our remediation activities with the knowledge and oversight of the ohio epa 
we completed an updated evaluation of our expected liability related to this matter based on the fine paid and remediation actions that we have taken and expect to take in the future 
as a result  we accrued an additional million in the third quarter of fiscal to increase our reserve based on the latest estimates 
in addition to the dispute with the ohio epa  we are negotiating with the philadelphia district of the us army corps of engineers regarding the terms of site remediation and the resolution of the corps civil penalty demand in connection with our prior peat harvesting operations at our lafayette  new jersey facility 
we are also addressing remediation concerns raised by the environment agency of the united kingdom with respect to emissions to air and groundwater at our bramford suffolk  the united kingdom facility 
we have reserved for our estimates of probable costs to be incurred in connection with each of these matters 
at september   million was accrued for the environmental and regulatory matters described herein  the majority of which is for site remediation 
most of the costs accrued as of september  are expected to be paid through fiscal  however  payments could be made for a period thereafter 
we believe that the amounts accrued as of september  are adequate to cover our known environmental exposures based on current facts and estimates of likely outcome 
however  the adequacy of these accruals is based on several significant assumptions  including the following that we have identified all of the significant sites that must be remediated  that there are no significant conditions of potential contamination that are unknown to us  and that with respect to the agreed judicial consent order in ohio  the potentially contaminated soil can be remediated in place rather than having to be removed and only specific stream segments will require remediation as opposed to the entire stream 
if there is a significant change in the facts and circumstances surrounding these assumptions  it could have a material impact on the ultimate outcome of these matters and our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
during fiscal   and we expensed approximately million  million  and million for environmental matters 
there were no material capital expenditures in fiscal  or related to environmental or regulatory matters

item legal proceedings as noted in the discussion in item business environmental and regulatory considerations and item business regulatory actions  we are involved in several pending environmental matters 
we believe that our assessment of contingencies is reasonable and that related reserves  in the aggregate  are adequate  however  there can be no assurance that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
pending material legal proceedings are as follows agrevo environmental health  inc on june   agrevo environmental health  inc agrevo which subsequently changed its name to aventis environmental health science usa lp filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york the new york action  against the scotts company  a subsidiary of the scotts company and monsanto seeking damages and injunctive relief for alleged antitrust violations and breach of contract by the scotts company and its subsidiary and antitrust violations and tortious interference with contract by monsanto 
the scotts company purchased a consumer herbicide business from agrevo in may agrevo claims in the suit that the scotts company s subsequent agreement to become monsanto s exclusive sales and marketing agent for monsanto s consumer roundup business violated the federal antitrust laws 
agrevo contends that monsanto attempted to or did monopolize the market for non selective herbicides and conspired with the scotts company to eliminate the herbicide the scotts company previously purchased from agrevo  which competed with monsanto s roundup 
agrevo also contends that the scotts company s execution of various agreements with monsanto  including the roundup marketing agreement  as well as the scotts company s subsequent actions  violated agreements between agrevo and the scotts company 
agrevo is requesting damages as well as affirmative injunctive relief  and seeking to have the court invalidate the roundup marketing agreement as violative of the federal antitrust laws 
under the indemnification provisions of the roundup marketing agreement  monsanto and the scotts company each have requested that the other indemnify against any losses arising from this lawsuit 
on january   the scotts company filed a supplemental counterclaim against agrevo for breach of contract 
the scotts company alleges that agrevo owes the scotts company for amounts that the scotts company overpaid to agrevo 
the scotts company s counterclaim is now part of the underlying litigation 
a trial date has been set for february  the scotts company believes that agrevo s claims in these matters are without merit and is vigorously defending against them 
if the above actions are determined adversely to the scotts company  the result could have a material adverse effect on the scotts company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
any potential exposure that the scotts company may face cannot be reasonably estimated 
therefore  no accrual has been established related to these matters 
central garden pet company the scotts company v 
central garden  southern district of ohio on june   the scotts company filed suit against central garden pet company central garden in the us district court for the southern district of ohio the ohio action to recover approximately million in accounts receivable and additional damages for other breaches of duty 
central garden filed counterclaims including allegations that the scotts company and central garden had entered into an oral agreement in april whereby the scotts company would allegedly share with central garden the benefits and liabilities of any future business integration between the scotts company and monsanto 
the court dismissed a number of central garden s counterclaims as well as the scotts company s claims that central garden breached other duties owed to the scotts company 
on april   a jury returned a verdict in favor of the scotts company of million and for central garden on its remaining counterclaims in an amount of approximately million

the scotts company v 
aventis sa and starlink logistics  inc on august   the scotts company filed suit against aventis sa and its wholly owned subsidiary starlink logistics  inc in the us district court for the southern district of ohio 
in the complaint  the scotts company alleges it is entitled to injunctive and monetary relief arising from aventis and starlink s interference with the scotts company s contractual right to purchase a company called techpac  llc from one of aventis former subsidiaries  aventis cropscience 
the complaint alleges that pursuant to a contract between the scotts company and a predecessor in interest to aventis cropscience  aventis cropscience was obligated to make a bona fide offer to sell its interest in techpac to the scotts company 
the complaint further alleges that aventis directed aventis cropscience to make a belated sham offer to the scotts company and that later  upon the sale of aventis cropscience to bayer ag  aventis transferred ownership of techpac to starlink  an act which has made it impossible for aventis cropscience s successor in interest to make a bona fide offer to sell techpac to the scotts company 
in this suit  the scotts company seeks to ensure that it is able to exercise its right to receive a bona fide offer to acquire techpac  and the scotts company seeks to recover compensatory and punitive damages in an amount as yet undetermined for aventis and starlink s interference with the scotts company s right to receive such an offer

cv other the scotts company has been named a defendant in a number of cases alleging injuries that the lawsuits claim resulted from exposure to asbestos containing products  apparently based on the scotts company s historic use of vermiculite in certain of its products 
the complaints in these cases are not specific about the plaintiffs contacts with the scotts company or its products 
the scotts company in each case is one of numerous defendants and none of the claims seeks damages from the scotts company alone 
the scotts company believes that the claims against it are without merit and is vigorously defending them 
it is not currently possible to reasonably estimate a probable loss  if any  associated with the cases and  accordingly  no accrual or reserves have been recorded in the scotts company s consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that these cases  whether as a result of adverse outcomes or as a result of significant defense costs  will not have a material adverse effect on the scotts company  its financial condition or its results of operations 
the scotts company is reviewing agreements and policies that may provide insurance coverage or indemnity as to these claims and is pursuing coverage under some of these agreements  although there can be no assurance of the results of these efforts 
we are involved in other lawsuits and claims which arise in the normal course of our business 
in our opinion  these claims individually and in the aggregate are not expected to result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

basic and diluted earnings per share would have been as follows if the accounting change for intangible assets adopted in the fiscal year beginning october   had been adopted as of october  for the fiscal year ended september  income available to common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share ebitda is defined as income from operations  plus depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ebitda provides additional information for determining our ability to meet debt service requirements 
ebitda does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and ebitda does not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient to meet cash requirements 
ebitda margin is calculated as ebitda divided into net sales 
our measure of ebitda  which may not be similar to other similarly titled captions used by other companies  excludes million of cash expenses related to the refinancings of the company s credit facility and redemption of the company s subordinated notes in fiscal these expenses have been excluded since they are deemed to be financing related costs that are typically excluded from the presentation of ebitda and the definitions used by our lenders to evaluate the company s compliance with its debt agreements 
a numeric reconciliation of ebitda to income from operations is as follows for the fiscal year ended september  income from operations depreciation and amortization ebitda item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary scotts is the leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded products for lawn and garden care and professional horticulture in the united states and europe 
we also have a presence in canada  australia  the far east  latin america and south america 
also  in the united states  we operate the second largest residential lawn service business  scotts lawnservice 
in fiscal  our operations were divided into three business segments north america  scotts lawnservice  and international 
the north america segment includes the lawns  gardening products  ortho  north america professional and canadian business groups 
we are also monsanto s exclusive agent for the marketing and distribution of consumer roundup non selective herbicide within the united states and other contractually specified countries 
in fiscal  we continued the rapid expansion of our scotts lawnservice business 
through acquisitions and internal growth  revenues increased from approximately million in fiscal to over million in fiscal we invested approximately million of capital in lawn care acquisitions in fiscal and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in fiscal and beyond 
in addition  we invested approximately million to buyout the minority owners in the scotts lawnservice business 
as a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company  we focus our consumer marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer research  on creating consumer demand to pull products through the retail distribution channels 
in the past three years  we have spent approximately of our net sales annually on media advertising to support and promote our products and brands 
we have applied this consumer marketing focus for the past several years  and we believe that scotts receives a significant return on these marketing expenditures 
we expect that we will continue to focus our marketing efforts toward the consumer and make additional targeted investments in consumer marketing expenditures in the future to continue to drive market share and sales growth 
in fiscal  we expect to increase advertising spending as we deliver a new media message for ortho  lawns  miracle gro  and roundup on new products 
our sales are susceptible to global weather conditions 
for instance  periods of wet weather like we experienced in the spring of in the united states could adversely impact sales of certain products  while increasing demand for other products 
we believe that our past acquisitions have somewhat diversified both our product line risk and geographic risk to weather conditions 
historically  the majority of our shipments to retailers have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters 
however  over the past few years  retailers have reduced their pre season inventories by relying on scotts to deliver products in season when consumers seek to buy our products 
this change in retailer purchasing patterns and the increasing importance of scotts lawnservice revenues has caused a sales shift from our second fiscal quarter to the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
net sales by quarter were    and  respectively  of fiscal net sales 
concurrent with this sales shift  and because of the expansion of scotts lawnservice  the company has experienced a shift in profitability from the second to third and fourth fiscal quarters  with the third fiscal quarter now more profitable than the second fiscal quarter 
the company s fourth fiscal quarter  historically a loss making quarter  improved in fiscal beginning in fiscal  the company began expensing prospective grants of employee stock based compensation awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 

the fair value of future awards is being expensed ratably over the vesting period  which has historically been three years  except for grants to directors  which have a six month vesting period 
the related compensation expense recorded in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard eliminates the requirement to amortize indefinite lived assets and goodwill 
it also requires an initial impairment test on all indefinite lived assets as of the date of adoption of this standard and impairment tests done at least annually thereafter 
we completed our initial impairment analysis in the second quarter of fiscal  taking into account additional guidance provided by eitf  unit of measure for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result  a pre tax impairment charge related to the value of tradenames in our german  french and united kingdom consumer businesses of million was recorded as of october  after income taxes  the net charge was million which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
there was no goodwill impairment as of the date of adoption 
upon completing the annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of fiscal  it was determined that a charge for impairment was not required 
in fiscal  we announced the international profit improvement plan the plan to improve the operations and profitability of our european based consumer and professional businesses 
by the end of  we anticipate spending between million and million in the aggregate on various projects related to this plan  approximately of which will be capital expenditures 
approximately of the total spending relates to the reorganization and rationalization of our european supply chain  increased sales force productivity  and a shift to pan european category management of our product portfolio 
as part of this initiative  restructuring and other charges will be incurred at various times 
under the plan  profitability has improved  but the international business continues to perform below expectations 
as such  we are exploring all options for our international business  with the goal of improving shareholder value 
for further information concerning the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal years  and  see note to the consolidated financial statements
