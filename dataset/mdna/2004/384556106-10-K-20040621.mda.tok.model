forward looking statements certain statements contained in this document  including within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  that are not historical facts  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements  in general  predict  forecast  indicate or imply future results  performance or achievements and generally use words so indicative 
the company wishes to caution the reader that numerous important factors which involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors affecting the company s operations  markets  products  services and prices  and other factors discussed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  in the future  could affect the company s actual results and could cause its actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by  or on behalf of  the company 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenue and all related costs on contracts with a duration in excess of three months and with revenue of at least  and pounds sterling  in the usa and uk operating segments  respectively  using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is determined by relating actual labor incurred to date to management s estimate of total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated costs at completion 
revenue not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is accounted for on the completed contract method because of the large number of contracts and the fact that the effects of the use of such method do not vary materially from the use of the percentage of completion method 
the company recognizes revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is generally required throughout the construction process and the company has no further obligations under the contract after the revenue is recognized 
pension and postretirement benefits the company s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions  which are reviewed annually by the company  include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
the company bases the discount rate assumption for its plans on the aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and management s expectation as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on the company s long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of the likely long term trends 
to the extent that actual results differ from our assumptions  the differences are reflected as unrecognized gains and losses and are amortized to earnings over the estimated future service period of the plan participants to the extent such total net recognized gains and losses exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market related value of assets 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in future assumptions would affect the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations 
use of estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
use of estimates include the recording of revenue  pension obligations  and the underlying assumptions and valuation reserves for uncollectible accounts  inventory obsolescence  deferred taxes  warranty and liquidated damages 
results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report 
usa uk usa uk usa uk sales       net loss income  diluted loss earnings per share identifiable assets       amounts above are inclusive of intercompany amounts 
compared to consolidated sales net of intercompany sales were  for the fiscal year ended march  this represents a decrease as compared to fye sales from usa operations were down from last year 
the decrease in sales resulted from significantly fewer surface condenser sales 
surface condenser sales to the domestic power industry and worldwide chemical industry were down due to a capacity to demand imbalance in these industries 
the three principal markets graham serves are now in varying stages of recovery 
the refinery market for graham s products is picking up due to clean fuel standards regulatory requirements 
the chemical market is coming back due to the strength of the general global economic recovery 
the domestic power industry for plants of about mega watts in size is in a moderate recovery mode due to the need for more efficient plants and ones that are more environmentally friendly 
we expect these markets to continue to be active for several years 
the most significant threats our company faces in its markets today are the effects of terrorist acts on economic activity in graham s markets and metal shortages ie  the ability to obtain materials timely and pass potentially higher costs through to the customer 
either of these threats  or others  could dampen or stop the market recoveries now occurring 
although order opportunities are increasing  pricing remains very competitive and may continue to hold gross profit margins below historical levels for orders booked through at least the first half of fye sales from uk operations increased for the year 
the increased sales are attributed to several large orders shipped to china for the petrochemical industry  and continued strong activity in offshore oil operations 
like usa operations  the markets  in general  and  in particular  the chemical industry  show signs of recovery 
while offshore oil activity remains strong  significant improvement in inquiries for gppl s traditional products eg  liquid ring pumps is evident 
the consolidated gross profit percentage was for the current year as compared to for fye usa operations gross profit margin remained unchanged as compared to fye at  as overall production overhead costs were managed in proportion to lower sales 
cost actions initiated in prior years helped to reduce production costs in fye as compared to fye for example  in february  postretirement medical benefits for employees of the usa operation employed as of april  were terminated 
additionally  real estate taxes were reduced as a result of a legal proceeding settlement entered in september and workers compensation costs were reduced by back to work programs 
the company was also able to reduce its warranty reserve because certain claims of significant value were settled 
the gross profit margin from uk operations decreased from last year to for the current year due to quality problems pertaining to faulty and incorrect materials supplied by vendors 
this led to high re work costs 
a second problem causing the decrease in gross profit margins in the uk was downward pressure on selling prices 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fye were of sales as compared to for the prior year 
this percentage increase is due to reduced sales in fye total sg a costs for the current year were down 
the decrease was due to lower employment costs resulting from a major staff downsizing in fye interest expense increased in the current year 
the increased expense came from uk operations and follows higher short term bank debt 
short term debt increased significantly in the fourth quarter due to low shipping activity in january and february 
product shipments were delayed to march due to technical specification matters that needed to be addressed 
other income for fye was as compared to  for fye the current year s income represents a curtailment gain resulting from the discontinuation of postretirement medical benefits discussed above 
other income of  recognized in fye was a result of a contract cancellation fee on an order from a customer in the electric power generating industry 
other expense for the current year is zero as compared to in fye for severance costs 
the benefit for income taxes was of the loss before income tax benefit amount for the current year as compared to a provision for income taxes equal to of the income before income taxes amount in fye the fye effective rate increased due to an income tax benefit gained in terminating split dollar life insurance policies and distributing the proceeds to the respective employees in october the net loss for fye was  or per fully diluted share 
the company recognized a net income of or per fully diluted share for fye compared to consolidated sales net of intercompany sales were  for the fiscal year ended march  this represents a increase over fye sales from usa operations were greater than the prior year by  primarily due to maintaining domestic market share comparable to the prior year while increasing export sales about over fye the increased sales were due to specific refining and electric power generating projects and not a general recovery in foreign markets 
sales from uk operations decreased as compared to fye in particular  significant reductions came in sales of pump package systems and spare parts 
the reduction in spare part sales was due to fewer replacements purchased by traditional customers 
this was due to significant buying in recent prior years 
the decline in pump package sales was due to the absence of orders for large sales values 
uk sales of pumps for offshore oil facilities for fye were up as compared to fye this increase was due to the high cost of oil  which in turn makes the higher operating costs of offshore production feasible 
the consolidated gross profit percentage was as compared to for fye in the usa  the gross profit percentage was as compared to for the prior year 
this decline was due to the colder winter causing higher comfort heating charges  greater defined benefit pension costs due to the three year decline in the stock market and higher product warranty costs 
the gross profit percent in the uk dropped from in fye to in fye this was attributed to reduced sales volume and fewer sales in offshore spare parts 
spare part sales generate greater profit margins than new unit sales 
it is believed fewer replacement parts were sold because new pumps were purchased instead 
in addition to sales  the gross profit margin in the uk declined due to greater production overhead costs caused by temporary staffing needs 
as a percent of sales  production costs were of sales in fye as compared to in fye selling  general and administrative expenses for fye were down from fye sg a expenses represented of fye sales as compared to for fye the decrease in costs was due to lower variable compensation costs 
for fye  interest expense decreased due to reduced interest rates and maintaining a low debt level 
the provision for income taxes was for fye as compared to for the year ended march  the lower effective rate was due to the impact of the extra territorial income exclusion benefit from foreign shipments 
consolidated net income for fye was or 
per diluted share as compared to  or per diluted share in fye shareholders equity usa    uk    eliminations    book value per share compared to shareholders equity decreased or from march  decreases were caused by the net loss  an increase to the minimum pension liability adjustment and the corporate dividend 
these charges were partially offset by a favorable foreign currency translation adjustment  issuance of common stock resulting from the exercise of stock options and director and officer repayment of notes due for the purchase of graham s common stock under the long term stock ownership plan 
for further information  see consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity 
compared to shareholders equity decreased or in fye the company recognized a minimum pension liability adjustment net of an income tax benefit  which reduced equity by  this adjustment will be reversed if and to the extent the usa defined benefit pension plan investments in stocks and bonds recover 
liquidity and capital resources usa uk usa uk usa uk working capital       cash deficit flow from operations   cash and investments    capital expenditures long term borrowings capital leases working capital ratio long term debt equity contractual and commercial obligations less than total year years years thereafter short term debt   capital lease obligations operating leases pension and postretirement benefits   other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total   for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent anticipated contributions to the defined benefit pension plan and postretirement medical benefit plan for fye the company expects to be required to make cash contributions beyond one year 
compared to consolidated cash flow from operations was negative  for fye as compared to a positive cash flow of  for fye the negative cash flow was largely a result of the net loss  fewer customer progress payments due to fewer major orders eg  surface condensers and a significant defined benefit pension contribution due to the decrease in the value of the investments held by the defined benefit pension plan as a result of the stock market decline 
the company expects to continue to consume cash in excess of amounts generated from operations over the first several months of fiscal year to cover operating losses  dividends  and to fund a build up of work in process inventory for increased shipments in the second half of fye graham s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations  investments in short term us treasury bills  and secured credit agreements 
cash sources in and have been sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  and we believe our cash sources will be sufficient to meet our projected future cash requirements 
capital expenditures are estimated to be next year 
depreciation is estimated to be  compared to consolidated cash flow from operations was  for fye as compared to  for fye cash flow for fye was greatly enhanced by collection of the unusually large trade accounts receivable balance as of march receivables were substantially greater than normal due to fourth quarter fye significant customer cancellation fees and progress billings 
offsetting the change in the accounts receivable balance of  between march  and were an increase in inventory  a special payment to the defined benefit pension plan and fewer customer deposits 
inventory increased due to the manufacturing stage of usa customer orders  and uk operations increased inventories and short term debt acquiring dry pump gearboxes from a supplier who manufactured them under a make and hold program 
customer deposits decreased  this year as compared to fye due to the reduction of large projects currently in the manufacturing system 
to ensure compliance with a bank loan covenant  the company made an additional  payment to the defined benefit pension fund in fye a fourth item  which reduced working capital in fye  was the recognition of in accruals relating to terminations and retirements 
orders and backlog orders usa    uk    eliminations    consolidated    backlog usa    uk    eliminations consolidated    usa orders for the current year were down or  from last year 
uk orders were up over fye bookings for usa operations were down due to the decline of orders placed for surface condensers 
orders placed with the uk operation were up due to the increased activity in offshore oil projects and orders for the petrochemical industry 
orders placed with usa operations are expected to be greater in fye due to the recovering global economy and specific markets supplied by graham 
orders placed with uk operations are expected to be slightly greater than fye at march   the consolidated backlog was  down from march  all orders represent orders from traditional markets in the company s established product lines 
the backlog contains approximately  in orders that will likely not be shipped in the next twelve months 
in april  graham filed a complaint for breach of contract in the united states district court  asking the court to find a contract  valued at  and included in the  noted above  cancelled and award cancellation fees as specified in the contract 
market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from changes in market rates and prices to which graham is exposed are interest rates foreign exchange rates equity price risk the assumptions applied in preparing quantitative disclosures regarding interest rate  foreign exchange rate and equity price risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced in relevant historical periods  management s current knowledge of the business and market place  and management s judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the business 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
management s strategy for managing risks associated with interest rate fluctuations is to hold interest bearing debt to the absolute minimum and carefully assess the risks and rewards for incurring long term debt 
assuming year ended and variable rate debt  a change in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by and  respectively 
graham s international consolidated sales exposure for the current year approximated of annual sales as compared to for the year operating in world markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being the ability to competitively compete for orders against competition having a relatively weaker currency 
business lost due to this cannot be quantified 
secondly  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales in foreign currency to usa dollars 
the substantial portion of graham s sales is collected in the local currency usa dollars  uk pounds sterling 
in fye and  sales in foreign currencies were and of sales  respectively 
at certain times  the company may enter into forward foreign exchange agreements to hedge its exposure against unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
graham has limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in fye and  purchases in foreign currencies were and of cost of goods sold  respectively 
at certain times  forward foreign exchange contracts may be utilized to limit currency exposure 
foreign operations resulted in a current year net loss of as compared to a net loss of for fye as currency exchange rates change  translations of the income statements of the uk business into us dollars affect year over year comparability of operating results 
the increase in the foreign currency translation rate to convert pounds sterling to us dollars increased all uk income statement items and order amounts by and all uk balance sheet and backlog amounts by in fye over the company does not hedge translation risks because cash flows from uk operations are mostly reinvested in the uk 
a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted the uk reported net loss by approximately for fye and for the previous year 
the company has a long term incentive plan  which provides for awards of share equivalent units seus for outside directors based upon the company s performance 
the outstanding seus are recorded at fair market value thereby exposing the company to equity price risk 
gains and losses recognized due to market price changes are included in the company s results of operations 
based upon the seus outstanding at march  and  and a per share price  a change in the respective year end market price of the company s common stock would positively or negatively impact the company s operating results by to for fye and to in fye assuming required net income of is met  and based upon a market price of the company s stock of per share  a change in the stock price would positively or negatively impact the company s operating results by to in  to in  to in  to in and to in other matters the company broadened its market coverage of instantaneous water heaters in fye with the introduction of micromax 
this new standard product meets a market need for users who do not have available steam as a utility for the water heater 
increases in material and labor costs traditionally have been offset by cost cutting measures and selling price increases 
obtaining price increases is largely a factor of supply and demand for graham s products  whereas inflation factors can originate from influences outside of the company s direct global competition 
graham will continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects in future years through sales growth  pricing  product mix strategies  purchasing advantageously  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
the company s usa operations are governed by federal environmental laws  principally the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the clean air act  and the clean water act  as well as state counterparts environmental laws 
environmental laws require that certain parties fund remedial actions regardless of fault  legality or original disposal or ownership of the site 
graham is not involved in any environmental remediation projects 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others 
fin expands disclosure requirements and requires that a guarantor recognize  at fair value  a liability for its obligation under a guarantee 
the recognition and measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company has complied with the expanded disclosure requirements 
in january  the fasb issued fin consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for certain requirements and was amended in december to defer implementation of other requirements until march adoption of this standard had no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
sfas r  which deals with employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  and amended certain other related fasb statements 
this statement requires additional disclosures about assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
graham will adopt the provisions of sfas r as they become effective 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for pertinent disclosures for this reporting period
