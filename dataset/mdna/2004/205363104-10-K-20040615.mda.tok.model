item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of computer sciences corporation the company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended april  there are three primary objectives of this discussion to provide a narrative explanation of the financial statements  as presented through the eyes of management  to enhance the disclosures in the financial statements and footnotes  providing context within which the financial statements should be analyzed  and to provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results 
to achieve these objectives  the discussion is presented in the following sections overview includes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash  as well as a discussion of the key business drivers  economic and industry factors  fiscal highlights and fiscal commentary 
results of operations discusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal to  describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reporting segment basis  including new contracts  acquisitions and currency impacts  and also by describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories 
financial condition discusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes the company s liquidity position and available capital resources 
critical accounting estimates discusses accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates 
forward looking statements and risk factors that may affect future results describes the nature of forward looking statements and lists several factors that may affect future results 
overview the company s primary service offerings are information technology i t outsourcing and i t and professional services 
outsourcing involves operating all or a portion of a customer s technical infrastructure and also includes business process outsourcing 
i t and professional services include systems integration  consulting  and other professional services and also include product sales and related services 
csc provides these services to customers in the global commercial and us federal markets 
csc also provides certain non i t technical services  including aircraft maintenance  marine services and security services  primarily to us federal customers 
on a geographic basis  csc provides services to global commercial customers in the united states  europe  and other international locations 
operations in australia  asia and canada generate substantially all revenue within other international 
economic and industry factors global commercial markets are affected by various economic and industry factors 
the economic environment in the regions csc serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on i t projects 
csc is in a highly competitive industry  which keeps pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors  including service offerings 
management monitors industry factors including relative market shares  growth rates  billing rates  staff utilization rates  margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates  inflation rates  and foreign currency rates 
the us federal market is also highly competitive  and also has some unique characteristics 
all us government contracts and subcontracts may be modified  curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change 
in the event that a contract is terminated for convenience  the company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work actually performed 
shifting priorities of the us government can impact the future of projects as well 
the company recognized the increased priorities on defense and homeland security programs and has focused substantial business development efforts in these areas 
management monitors government priorities and industry factors via numerous industry and government publications and forecasts  legislative activity  budgeting and appropriation processes  and by participating in industry professional associations 
business drivers revenue is generated by providing services on a variety of different types of contracts lasting from less than six months to years or more 
factors affecting revenue include the company s ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards  the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes  the ability to compete on price  services offered  technical ability and experience  the ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues  and for international business  currency fluctuations 
earnings are driven by the above revenue factors  in addition to the following the ability to control costs  particularly labor costs  subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare  pension  general and administrative costs  the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses  and the ability to effectively estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals 
cash flows are impacted by earnings and revenues  among other factors  including the following timely management of receivables and payables  investment opportunities presented during a given year particularly related to business acquisitions and large outsourcing contracts  and the ability to manage capital in order to generate adequate returns from these investments 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means  with the primary financial measures including new contract wins  revenue growth  margins  cash flow  and return on investment 
new contract wins in addition to being a primary driver of future revenue  focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the company s ability to compete 
the total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new and recompeting contracts as well as numerous external factors 
revenue growth year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins  and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts 
given the wide array of services csc offers  the company s ability to obtain additional work from existing customers is an important factor 
in addition  incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in similar increases in costs  particularly overhead and other indirect costs  thus potentially improving profit margins 
margins margins reflect the company s performance on contracts 
while the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of acquisitions with different cost profiles  such as was the impact of the march dyncorp acquisition on fiscal ratios  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability 
cash flow a primary driver affecting csc s cash flow is the ability to manage receivables and payables 
thus  a review of the receivables measurement of days sales outstanding dso supports an ongoing focus on timely collections 
the company also regularly reviews the gaap cash flow measurements of operating  investing and financing cash flows 
return on investment roi roi is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization 
a combination of strong margins and investment base turnover is required to generate sufficient returns on invested capital 
in addition  the timing of cash flows impacts roi  so that large  up front investments particularly on new outsourcing contracts require higher profits in order to garner adequate roi 
readers should be cautioned that dso  free cash flow and roi are not gaap measures  and that the company s definition of such measures may differ from other companies 
therefore  such measures may not be comparable to other companies 
csc calculates dso as follows total receivables at quarter end divided by revenue per day 
revenue per day equals total revenues for the quarter divided by the number of days in the quarter 
free cash flow is equal to the sum of operating and investing cash flows  excluding acquisitions and dispositions 
roi is calculated by multiplying profit margin times investment base turnover 
the profit margin used is profit before interest and special items and after tax divided by revenues 
investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity 
fiscal highlights highlights of the year included revenues rose  approximately before currency fluctuations 
the company s march acquisition of dyncorp contributed points of growth 
net income grew before the impact of a dyncorp acquisition related special charge 
earnings per share were up before the dyncorp special charge 
record contract awards of billion were announced  more than double the prior year  with new global commercial awards totaling billion and new us federal awards of billion 
cash flows from operating activities generated billion versus billion in fiscal  investing activities used cash of billion versus million in the prior year  and free cash flow grew to million  up from million in fiscal dso improved to days  down from days normalized for dyncorp at the end of the prior year 
debt to total capitalization ratio was at year end  improved from a year earlier 
roi for the year was  up from the prior year of 
the company s level of announced new business awards was the highest in csc s history 
significant wins included the following 
global commercial royal mail group billion  united kingdom national health service billion  sas group billion  marconi corporation million  swiss re life health million  national grid transco million  iss million  and malayan banking berhad million 
us federal us state department s civilian police program billion  us army aviation center billion  us army aviation and missile command million  national aeronautics and space administration million  us postal service million  and us department of veterans affairs million 
these multi year awards represent the estimated value at contract signing 
they cannot be considered firm orders  however  due to their variable attributes  including demand driven usage  modifications in scope of work due to changing customer requirements  and the annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity characteristics of major portions of the company s us federal activities 
revenue growth was led by csc s federal sector  which benefited significantly from the acquisition of dyncorp in march global commercial revenues were positively impacted by recent large outsourcing contract wins  particularly in europe  but were offset by declines elsewhere 
currency shifts during the year also favorably impacted revenue 
the company s growth has created a broad  long term global revenue base across numerous customers  industries  geographic regions and service offerings 
over of csc s revenues come from long term contracts including global commercial outsourcing and us federal government engagements 
a combination of fiscal earnings and strong working capital management contributed to debt reduction and a large cash balance at year end 
cash used to pay down debt during the year drove the debt to total capitalization ratio down to its lowest level in over three and a half years 
higher cash flow generated from operating activities in fiscal was a result of higher earnings with larger non cash expense components such as depreciation and amortization 
higher outflows of cash for investing activities were primarily a result of up front investments on new outsourcing contracts requiring fixed asset purchases as well as other capitalized costs 
fiscal commentary since dyncorp has now been part of csc for over a year  the year over year growth rates in revenue and earnings experienced during fiscal will not be repeated in fiscal however  the us federal sector reporting segment is well positioned to benefit from the anticipated growing demands of the us federal government 
the us federal government is one of the world s largest information technology services customers  and its spending is expected to continue to increase during calendar in order to improve technologies in the areas of defense  homeland security  civil agency modernization  and education 
while the ultimate distribution of us federal funds and project assignments remain uncertain  the company expects its information technologies and outsourcing capabilities  including the skill set acquired with dyncorp  to be viewed favorably by the us federal government 
while demand for information technology outsourcing services continued to grow  particularly in europe  the information technology services industry continued to experience overall sluggish global demand for commercial project oriented activities during fiscal many customers maintained low levels of discretionary spending in response to the economic environment in their particular regions 
however  indications suggest stabilization is occurring in the us market s demand for consulting and systems integration services  although the company expects continued pressure on demand for information technology services in european and other international markets 
worldwide global demand for outsourcing services is expected to be strong again during fiscal while the future demand for outsourcing services is unknown  the long term nature of major outsourcing engagements allows outsourcing providers such as csc to benefit from a certain level of continuity 
thus  the record setting year in new business awards  much of which came from new outsourcing engagements  is expected to generate growth in global commercial reporting segment revenues in fiscal during fiscal  the company s global commercial segment benefited from currency fluctuations in europe and other international regions 
the company cannot forecast future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact on operating results 
the company s overall short term financial objectives include successfully launch the numerous new contracts won during fiscal  with particular focus on the large new outsourcing contracts 
maintain appropriate investment base turnover rates and operating margins  particularly focusing on the new business  in order to generate an improved return on investment 
pursue the large current pipeline of commercial and us federal opportunities and win the company s proportionate share 
the company s primary long term objective is to continue developing and obtaining the core capabilities and differentiating factors that will enable csc to compete effectively in both the federal and global commercial markets 
the company will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that can enhance its core capabilities and review its portfolio of business operations for overall strategic fit 
continued long term revenue and earnings growth will come from the combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
results of operations revenues revenues for the global commercial and us federal sector segments see note for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions amount percent change amount percent change amount us commercial    europe    other international    global commercial    us federal sector    corporate 

total   
 the major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows fiscal vs 
fiscal dyncorp acquisition approximate impact of currency fluctuations net internal growth total us commercial europe other international global commercial 
us federal sector corporate total 
fiscal vs 
fiscal dyncorp acquisition approximate impact of currency fluctuations net internal growth total us commercial europe other international global commercial us federal sector corporate total 
the biggest drivers of revenue growth in fiscal were the dyncorp acquisition and the impact of currency fluctuations which contributed and  respectively 
the remaining overall internal growth of a net 
was the result of growth in the global commercial segment s european region and growth in the us federal sector s defense business  offset by declines in other global commercial regions as well as in federal sector s civil business 
strong outsourcing revenue growth in global commercial  particularly in the united kingdom and europe s nordic region  was offset by reduced consulting and systems integration work 
the company s announced billion in new business awards compared with billion and billion announced for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while more of the impact from the fiscal new business awards started to flow through to revenues in the latter half of the year  a greater impact should occur in fiscal as the contracts move through start up phases into full production 
comparing fiscal to fiscal  declines in global commercial segment revenues were substantially offset by the us federal sector s growth 
the sluggish global economy resulted in declining demands for project oriented work such as consulting and systems integration projects  bringing down overall global commercial revenues despite increases in outsourcing revenues 
global commercial major global commercial outsourcing contracts  won in fiscal and fiscal  as measured by the first months per contract over million in annual revenues  accounted for approximately million of the fiscal revenue growth  driven by growing european outsourcing markets and increased market share 
these increases from outsourcing were more than offset by declines in consulting  systems integration and other areas  resulting in a net decline of 
for the year on a constant currency basis 
in the fiscal fourth quarter  however  the impact of the new wins coupled with stabilizing conditions for project work in the us drove overall fourth quarter global commercial revenue up on a constant currency basis 
declines in non us project work as well as in the financial services market sector continued in the fourth quarter  however  and are expected to continue in fiscal the company announced billion in new global commercial business awards during fiscal compared with the billion announced during fiscal and billion announced during fiscal primary contributors to global commercial s european fiscal revenue growth included the following outsourcing contracts royal mail group  bombardier transportation  marconi  sas group  iss and national grid transco 
these six contracts combined for million of new revenue 
europe has seen growth in the outsourcing market with economic conditions driving the adoption of outsourcing to help improve business performance 
by focusing on large opportunities  the company has significantly improved its market position as highlighted by the wins noted above 
softness in demand for consulting and systems integration work  particularly in germany  france and italy  partially offset the outsourcing increases  resulting in an overall european revenue increase of on a constant currency basis 
the soft demand  primarily driven by continued economic sluggishness in europe which is dampening customer discretionary spending for short term project work  is not expected to improve significantly in europe during fiscal us commercial operations benefited from growth on new and existing outsourcing contracts  including motorola  bombardier transportation  general dynamics  dun bradstreet  british telecom north america  ascension health and providian  which combined for million in fiscal revenue growth 
offsetting these improvements was the significantly reduced scope on the renewal of one engagement for which csc was previously the primary outsourcing provider and is now a subcontractor  resulting in a million decline 
in addition  two outsourcing contracts that substantially ended in fiscal resulted in a million decline year over year 
the net effect of the new business and other growth  offset by the various declines  resulted in an overall decline of for the us commercial operations in fiscal the negative impact from the three contracts mentioned should not affect fiscal revenues to the same degree as in fiscal  and there were no similarly significant events during fiscal in addition  the company s us consulting and systems integration business stabilized during fiscal  with slight increases to headcounts and staff utilization rates  offset by slight declines in billing rates 
thus  fiscal us commercial revenues are expected to exceed fiscal an constant currency revenue decline in other international fiscal revenues was driven by a drop in australian outsourcing revenues plus weaker third party product sales in australia and asia 
overall softness in these markets is expected to continue in fiscal  but will be offset somewhat by a major asian outsourcing win in fiscal with malayan banking berhad 
comparing fiscal to fiscal for global commercial  revenue declined in constant currency 
the company s european operations generated fiscal outsourcing revenue growth of approximately  but that was more than offset by a revenue decline in consulting and systems integration services  including the financial services vertical market 
sources of outsourcing revenue growth included bae systems  nortel networks  british nuclear fuels limited  and whitbread accounts  and the impact of new business including bombardier transportation  united kingdom department of health  and allders 
for fiscal  us commercial revenue declined by  or million 
approximately one third of this decline was attributable to reduced demand for consulting and systems integration services 
substantially the entire consulting and systems integration decline occurred in the first and second quarters of fiscal with stabilization in demand starting to take place in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the balance of the us commercial revenue decline was attributable to expiration of outsourcing contracts and client reductions in billable volumes and discretionary projects  partially offset by over million in new outsourcing engagements 
other international revenue declined on a constant currency basis during fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to reduced product sales and related services reflecting the economic downturn in asian markets 
us federal the company s us federal sector revenues were derived from the following sources fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions amount percent change amount percent change amount department of defense    civil agencies   other total us federal sector    for fiscal  revenue earned on government wide acquisition contracts presented based upon the end customer rather than the agency in which the contract originated 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform 
other revenues consist of state and local government as well as commercial contracts performed by the us federal sector reporting segment 
prior year amounts have been adjusted to conform to this definition 
dyncorp accounted for approximately points of the fiscal revenue growth in the us federal sector 
excluding dyncorp  revenues from other federal sector operations increased slightly during fiscal  primarily from department of defense contracts  most notably missile defense  a us navy multiple awards contract  and several intelligence contracts  all of which combined for approximately million in additional revenue 
offsetting this growth was reduced level of effort on a logistics contract with the army  due to completion of the initial phase of the core project 
also  a previously consolidated joint venture s revenue no longer is reported by csc due to a reorganization that resulted in minority ownership for csc 
these two contracts accounted for a million decline for the year 
revenue from civil agencies  excluding dyncorp  was down for the year  driven mainly by decreases on contracts with the internal revenue service  department of education and nasa  which accounted for million in reduced revenues 
during fiscal  csc announced federal contract awards with a total value of billion  compared to billion and billion announced during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal awards had a minor impact on revenue growth  but are expected to make more significant contributions in fiscal the company has identified billion of federal opportunities that will be awarded in fiscal and that the company expects to pursue  plus an additional billion over the following months 
the company expects to win its proportionate share of these opportunities 
revenues from the us federal sector increased during fiscal versus fiscal the contribution of former dyncorp operations from the date of acquisition  march  to march  accounted for million or approximately of us federal sector s revenue growth 
the remaining revenue growth of  or million  is principally attributable to new and increased work related to intelligence community activities  the internal revenue service irs prime contract  general services administration contracts  and an immigration and naturalization service contract 
costs and expenses the company s costs and expenses were as follows dollar amount percentage of revenue dollars in millions costs of services    selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization interest expense  net special items 
total    changes to the various cost and expense ratio percentages in fiscal were primarily due to the dyncorp acquisition 
with generally more labor intensive operations  the acquired dyncorp business had higher costs of services cos as a percentage of revenue and lower ratios for selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as well as for depreciation and amortization d a expense 
in addition  the special items relate to the dyncorp acquisition 
excluding dyncorp operations  fiscal ratios for cos  sg a and d a would have been  and  respectively 
fiscal ratios would have been   and  respectively  excluding the three weeks of dyncorp operations at the end of the year 
the company substantially matches revenues and costs in the same currency 
therefore  the foreign currency impact of for the year on revenues and costs did not have a material impact on costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue 
costs of services costs of services as a percentage of revenue improved slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal  when excluding the effect of the acquired dyncorp operations  which had a cos ratio of 
the improvement was driven primarily by other us federal sector operations  which posted a decrease to cos ratio of points  partly offset by a 
point ratio increase in global commercial operations 
us federal sector results included adjustments from normal program reviews in fiscal and that resulted in a net year over year increase to profitability on long term contracts  as well as from the final settlement for modifications to a fixed price contract 
the global commercial 
point increase was from an increase in europe  primarily germany  france and italy  where soft demand for consulting and systems integration project work adversely impacted the ratio 
for fiscal  the company s costs of services as a percentage of revenue decreased to from 
performance improvements in us outsourcing operations contributed points of improvement resulting from cost containment efforts  consolidation of regional and back office functions in multiple geographies  and use of less costly offshore sites 
performance improvements in us federal  us consulting and systems integration  and other international operations contributed equally to 
points of improvement 
europe operations caused a 
point adverse shift  primarily due to revenue shortfalls resulting from soft i t project demand 
shifts in the mix of business towards federal operations  which carry a higher ratio of costs of services  caused an adverse movement of 
points 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses declined 
point to of revenues for fiscal  excluding the impact of dyncorp operations which had a sg a ratio in fiscal the slight change was a result of an offsetting increase in other us federal operations of 
point and decrease in global commercial of 
point 
increased investment in business development activities in us federal was the primary cause for the slight increase  in addition to somewhat higher insurance and other costs 
contributing about equally to the global commercial ratio improvement were a reduced need for provisions for doubtful accounts and other cost improvements  the latter primarily in outsourcing operations 
provisions for doubtful accounts benefited from the company s long term client relationships and generally high client credit quality  and a lack of charges seen over the last several years related to weakness in the high technology and telecommunications markets 
for fiscal  the increased volume of new business as a result of the record awards in fiscal are expected to outpace growth in sg a expenses  thus effecting a slight improvement next year 
the 
point fiscal sg a reduction as compared to fiscal is attributable to a million decrease in provision for doubtful accounts and european performance improvements of approximately million partially offset by us commercial and other international performance declines 
the favorable impact of a shift in the company s business mix towards the us federal sector  where sg a costs are lower as a percentage of revenue than the company s composite  substantially offset a decline in the us federal sector s performance in sg a 
depreciation and amortization excluding the dyncorp operations  which had only a d a ratio  the company s ratio increased to of revenues versus in the prior year 
increases at other us federal operations were a primary cause of the overall increase  and were mainly due to internal software and computer equipment additions that were made in fiscal as a result of accommodating the increased demands from the dyncorp operations 
global commercial d a ratios were unchanged from the prior year 
the company s fiscal d a expense as a percentage of revenue was virtually unchanged compared to fiscal fiscal included million related to goodwill and employee workforce amortization which is no longer amortized as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on march  an approximate 
point improvement in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue from this absence of amortization of goodwill and employee workforce acquired was offset by depreciation related to additional investments during fiscal and fiscal in equipment and contract costs in support of outsourcing clients 
interest expense the increase in interest expense  net of interest income  for fiscal is primarily attributable to additional borrowings  driven in part by the dyncorp acquisition 
as a percentage of revenues  net interest improved slightly for fiscal the million decrease in net interest expense for fiscal resulted from a lower average outstanding debt partially offset by a higher average interest rate and decreased interest income 
special items csc s net profit margin in fiscal was reduced 
for charges associated with the special item related to the dyncorp acquisition 
the charges relate to exit or disposal activities of legacy csc operations as a result of an assessment of requirements for the combined csc dyncorp organization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description 
charges related to this special item were booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal the impact to fiscal margins was insignificant 
no additional charges related to the dyncorp acquisition are expected 
taxes the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax earnings before special items was   and for the three years ended april  including special items in fiscal and  effective rates were and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily a result of increased profits and the decreasing impact of existing favorable permanent tax differences that do not vary directly with increased profits 
the decrease of points in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal resulted from the ceasing of goodwill and employee workforce amortization in fiscal  which decreased the effective rate by approximately points 
this decrease was partially offset by the reduced relative impact of permanent tax differences 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
financial condition cash flows dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal net cash from operations    net cash used in investing   net cash used in financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year historically  the majority of the company s cash and cash equivalents have been provided from operating activities 
operating activities for fiscal generated billion in net cash  up from billion generated for fiscal higher net earnings  coupled with an increase in non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  drove the increase in operating cash 
in addition  a slightly improved year end dso was indicative of faster collections of accounts receivable 
improved cash disbursements management also resulted in more cash on hand 
another driver was an increase in deferred revenue  coming from customer prepayments for services and up front payments for contract start up and transition activities for some contracts as a result of management s focus on cash 
partially offsetting these net inflows was an increase in prepaid expenses  which was principally for software licenses and maintenance agreements that relate to services provided on some of the new outsourcing contracts 
given the new business won during fiscal  primarily from europe and us outsourcing contracts  fiscal cash flow from operations is expected to increase slightly 
during fiscal  net cash provided from operations decreased from fiscal primarily due to a reduction in payables and accrued expenses  net of acquired dyncorp balances  partially offset by additional net earnings and a lesser increase in accounts receivable 
the company s investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and software  and deferred outsourcing contract costs that support the company s expanding global commercial operations 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
for cash flow presentation purposes  the outsourcing contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients  that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet 
outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contract s acquisition or start up  including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premium 
major new fiscal outsourcing contracts  motorola  marconi and royal mail group contracts in particular  drove much of the increased investments during the year 
the new fiscal outsourcing contracts  as well as contractually driven equipment refresh requirements on existing contracts  are also expected to drive fiscal investing cash outflows up slightly 
significant capital expenditures and outsourcing contract costs are expected from engagements with sas  uk national health service  utc  royal mail group  and two us federal sector contracts an army aviation training contract and an intelligence services contract 
additionally  internally deployed capital asset additions are expected to increase incrementally over fiscal  as part of a company program to consolidate and upgrade data centers in order to improve operating efficiencies and ratios 
despite the anticipated investment increases  total operating cash inflows are expected to more than cover total investing outflows for fiscal the company s investments also include acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  including significant amounts for fiscal related to the acquisition of dyncorp 
while increasing new business will typically generate higher overall capital investments  the level of capital per contract has generally trended lower over the past several years on new outsourcing contracts 
this has been a result of several factors  including an increased focus by the company on improving cash flow  customer assessments of the relative costs of making the investments themselves versus having csc do it  and a shifting mix towards contracts that are generally less capital intensive eg  from infrastructure technology outsourcing to applications management outsourcing engagements 
the company expects this trend to continue 
as described above  historically a majority of the company s capital investments have been funded by cash from operations 
net cash outflows from financing activities over the past three years reflect the company s commitment to reduce its overall debt levels and improve its debt to total capitalization ratio 
at year end fiscal  there was no outstanding commercial paper  a result of cash generated from operations and the issuance of million of new term debt 
the new notes were issued at  and are due april  the company issued million shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal to partially fund the dyncorp acquisition 
in addition  the company issued million of notes due february  the funds were used for general corporate purposes  including reduction of outstanding commercial paper which had increased as a result of paying off assumed dyncorp debt and the cash portion of the dyncorp consideration 
during fiscal  the company issued million of notes due june and million of notes due june the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes  including the reduction of outstanding commercial paper 
liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at april   million at march   and million at march  during fiscal  equity increased due to earnings  foreign currency translation adjustment million and a reduction in unfunded pension obligations million 
at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was  down from at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal these debt ratio improvements were the result of debt reduction and equity increases during fiscal and equity increases during fiscal dollars in millions debt    equity    total capitalization    debt to total capitalization the company s sources of liquidity include commercial paper and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
the company has commercial paper ratings from standard poor s  moody s and fitch of a  p and f  respectively 
short term borrowings are principally used to supplement operating cash flow in funding working capital requirements 
forecasted positive cash flows are expected to limit the need for short term borrowings during fiscal at april   the company had committed lines of credit providing million of long term and million of short term commercial paper backup which expire on august  and august   respectively 
if the company were unable to sell commercial paper  borrow under its uncommitted lines of credit  or determines it is too costly to do either of the aforementioned  the company has the ability to borrow under the two committed lines of credit 
these committed lines of credit are provided at a base rate  a eurodollar rate and a bid option rate 
the lines require the company to limit liens placed on our assets to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business  maintain a maximum consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of 
to  and maintain a not to exceed consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio of to 
for further details on these agreements please see exhibits and  which are incorporated by reference to this annual report 
as of april   the company had no borrowings under these lines and is in compliance with all terms of the agreements 
at april   the company had million of short term borrowings and billion of long term debt 
as further described in note of the company s annual report on form k for fiscal  the classification of the company s outstanding commercial paper is determined by the expiration dates of its credit facilities 
in addition  the company has provided foreign subsidiary debt guarantees of million to certain foreign banks 
during fiscal  the company issued million of term debt from its fiscal shelf registration 
the company s term debt has ratings from standard poor s  moody s  and fitch of a  a and a  respectively 
all three credit ratings have stable outlooks 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations by period as of april  dollars in millions less than year years years more than years total long term debt  capital lease obligations operating leases  minimum purchase obligations  other long term liabilities 


total     regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services that are necessary for the operations of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from to years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall 
the above table excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the company has numerous plans  both inside and outside of the us  and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis 
the minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  and can be in some years 
for most plans  the expected funding in fiscal is equal to the minimum that the company is legally obligated to make  but for other plans the company expects to fund at higher amounts based on its ability to recover the costs on cost reimbursable contracts 
in fiscal  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
the company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets  which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations 
refer to critical accounting estimates section later in this md a and to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  and unused short term borrowing capacity 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of debt and or equity securities 
during both fiscal and  the company issued million worth of term debt from the shelf registration  leaving million of shelf available for future debt and or equity issuances 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to regular review by the board of directors 
critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues 
while changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements  the risk is mitigated by the company s broad portfolio of contracts that would typically have offsetting adjustments 
the company has identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition and cost estimation on long term  fixed price contracts  revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization  capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs  assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill  assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities  and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition and cost estimation on long term  fixed price contracts while fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting currently comprise less than of csc s total revenue  the determination of revenues and costs on such contracts requires significant judgment and estimation 
the method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s software engineers  program managers and financial professionals 
key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor  and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates 
revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization if significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product  revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above 
thus  cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project  and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results 
capitalization of outsourcing contract costs certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition set up costs  and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection  costs associated with installation of systems and processes  and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premiums 
finance staff  working with program management  review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
key estimates and assumptions that the company must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs 
the company utilizes the experience and knowledge of its professional staff in program management  operations  procurement and finance areas  as well as third parties on occasion  to determine fair values of assets acquired 
to assess recoverability  undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the unamortized deferred cost balance 
such estimates require judgment and assumptions  which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of company personnel 
key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies 
a significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
capitalization of software development costs the company capitalizes certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
the company considers various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
for internal use software  the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of the company s ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis 
to assess the realizability or recoverability of capitalized software costs  the company must estimate future revenue  costs and cash flows 
such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows  and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to the company s results of operations 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill the company accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
third party valuation firms may be used to appraise certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by the company  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by company professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other disciplines 
changes in assumptions and estimates would result in changes to the fair values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
as goodwill is not amortized  goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment 
such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values 
cash flow projections are based on management approved estimates  which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance  operations and program management 
key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities the company offers a number of pension and postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to account for pension and postretirement plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require significant assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan  the asset mix of the plan  historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors 
the weighted average of the expected long term rates of return on plan assets utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the company s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
the weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately million or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
sfas no 
requires recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo at the end of the year 
at the end of both fiscal and fiscal  some of the company s pension plans had abos in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets  thus requiring additional minimum obligation 
the excess at the end of fiscal was lower than at the end of fiscal this resulted in a decrease to the minimum obligation in fiscal  with an offsetting decrease in intangible assets of million and a credit to equity of million  net of tax 
based on future plan asset performance and interest rates  additional changes to equity might be required 
assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation the company is subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
csc consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  the company accrues a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by generally matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
if necessary  the company may also use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions 
the company does not foresee changing its foreign currency exposure management strategy 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by or million  while a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by million 
this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
at april   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
