although recent published reports are signaling modest improvement in the global economy  we are cautious as to the speed at which macroeconomic conditions will improve  particularly as it relates to the information technology and communications industries  and believe our ability to generate new license sales will continue to be challenged in the near term 
the majority of our revenue has been generated from customers in the high technology  financial services and healthcare industries 
accordingly  our business is affected by the economic and business conditions of these industries and the demand for information technology within these industries 
macroeconomic conditions were extremely challenging during  and  and we expect them to continue to impact capital spending initiatives of our targeted new and existing customer base in the near term 
as a result of current economic uncertainties  we will be focused on the following objectives in the near term successful rebuilding of our direct sales force  managing our costs to allow our return to profitability and allow us to preserve our cash  focusing our resources and efforts on the sales opportunities with the highest probability of success  maximizing the value of our partnerships with key system integration and technology vendors  particularly as it relates to our embedded crm initiative and our key vertical industries  aggressive marketing of our recent major product releases on the windows nt microsoft backoffice and oracle unix platforms  and maintaining high customer satisfaction levels 
we hope that  by focusing our efforts on these key objectives  we will be able to return to profitability in challenging economic times and successfully grow our business  although we cannot offer any assurance regarding when  or whether  this will occur 
we continue to align costs and expenses to our expected revenues 
we may  however  continue to experience losses and negative cash flows in the near term  unless sales of our products and services grow 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  
table of contents and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex and often subject to interpretation 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software companies  including statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and related interpretations  including technical practice aids 
we generate revenue through two sources a software license revenue and b support and service revenue 
software license revenue is generated from licensing the rights to use our products directly to end users and vertical service providers  or vsps  and indirectly through value added resellers  or vars  and  to a lesser extent  through third party products we distribute 
support and service revenue is generated from sales of customer support services maintenance contracts  consulting services and training services performed for customers that license our products 
license revenue is recognized when a noncancellable license agreement becomes effective as evidenced by a signed contract  the product has been shipped  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  or consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change once the element is sold separately 
standard terms for license agreements call for payment within days 
probability of collection is based on the assessment of the customer s financial condition through the review of its current financial statements or credit reports 
for follow on sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also used to evaluate probability of collection 
revenue from distribution agreements with vars is typically recognized upon the earlier of receipt of cash from the var or identification of an end user 
in the latter case  probability of collection is evaluated based on the creditworthiness of the var 
our agreements with customers  vsps and vars do not contain product return rights 
revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenue is primarily related to implementation services performed on a time and materials basis or  in certain situations  on a fixed fee basis  under separate service arrangements 
implementation services are periodically performed under fixed fee arrangements and  in such cases  consulting revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized 
table of contents as services are performed 
standard terms for renewal of maintenance arrangements  consulting services and training services call for payment within days 
revenue consisting of fees from licenses sold together with consulting services is generally recognized upon shipment of the software  provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees do not depend on the performance of the services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees depends on the performance of the services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if a nonstandard acceptance period is provided  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance and the expiration of the acceptance period 
allowance for doubtful accounts a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
although no expenses were required in and we recorded a net benefit in  significant expenses were recorded to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in prior years due to the rapid downturn in the economy  and in the technology sector in particular  and we may record additional expenses in the future 
impairment of intangible assets we periodically evaluate intangible asset valuations of businesses we acquired as impairment indicators arise 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
restructuring during and  we recorded significant write offs and accruals in connection with our restructuring program under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
these write offs and accruals include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations related to excess leased facilities and other contracts 
although we believe that we have made reasonable estimates of our restructuring costs in calculating these write offs and accruals  the actual costs could differ from these estimates 
with the contractual settlement of the majority of our excess facilities  the range of outcomes that must be estimated has narrowed significantly  except for the value assigned to the warrants issued in connection with the settlement  which will fluctuate in the future based on our stock price 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to class action lawsuits and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for 
table of contents these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
results of operations we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful basis to predict our future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by young technology companies  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 
our future operating results will depend on many factors  including general economic conditions  which may affect our customers capital investment levels in management information systems and the timing of their purchases  rate of market acceptance of our crm solution  budget and spending decisions by our prospective and existing customers  customers and prospects decisions to defer orders or implementations  particularly large orders or implementations  from one quarter to the next  or to proceed with smaller than forecasted orders or implementations  level of purchases by our existing customers  including additional license and maintenance revenues  our ability to enable our products to operate on multiple platforms  our ability to compete in the highly competitive crm market  the loss of any key technical  sales  customer support or management personnel and the timing of any new hires  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product versions on a timely basis  variability in the mix of our license versus service revenue  the mix of our direct versus indirect license revenue and the mix of services that we perform versus those performed by third party service providers  our ability to successfully expand our operations  and the amount and timing of expenditures related to this expansion  and the cost and financial accounting effects of any acquisitions of companies or complementary technologies that we may complete

no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues in any of these periods 
our license revenue decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
we believe the decreases in license revenue from to and from to was primarily due to the progressive weakening of the global economy  which has caused a delay in the capital spending initiatives of our prospective and existing customers  particularly in the middle market 
macroeconomic conditions were extremely challenging during  and we believe that macroeconomic conditions will continue to be challenging in the near term which may delay capital spending initiatives of our prospective and existing customers 
our competitors inconsistency in delivering successful crm solutions has also resulted in more cautious buying behavior of prospective customers 
support and service revenue decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease from to was the result of a decrease in consulting and training services of million  offset by an increase in maintenance and support revenue of million 
the decrease from to was the result of an increase in consulting and training services of million  offset by a decrease in maintenance and support revenue of million 
service revenue represented of our total revenue in  in and in we expect to see a reduction in absolute dollars in our support and service revenue in future quarters due to the reduction in demand for our consulting services resulting from the decrease in our license revenue in recent quarters 
in addition  we may experience a decline in maintenance revenue as customers elect not to renew annual maintenance contracts in part or as a whole  primarily due to specific economic circumstances facing each of our customers and fewer new licenses sold in we expect the proportion of support and service revenue to 
table of contents total revenue to fluctuate in the future  depending in part on our customers direct use of third party consulting and implementation service providers  the degree to which we provide opportunities for our partners to engage with our customers and the ongoing renewals of customer support contracts  as well as our overall sales of software licenses to new and existing customers 
revenue outside of north america decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in we believe the decrease in revenue from to and from to outside of north america was primarily due to an adverse shift in the buying behavior of our targeted new and existing customer base as a result of economic conditions 
included in license revenue for the year ended december  is a sale to softbank commerce for approximately  for software licenses that will be internally deployed to support customer and business partner relations 
softbank commerce is a related party to softbank investments corporation  an entity which owns of onyx japan 
cost of revenue cost of license revenue cost of license revenue consists of license fees for third party software  product media  product duplication and manuals 
cost of license revenue decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of 
cost of license revenue as a percentage of related license revenues was in  in and in the changes in dollar amount during these periods in cost of license revenue was primarily due to changes in license revenue 
the increase in cost of license revenue as a percentage of related license revenue in compared to the prior years was primarily the result of a higher concentration of license revenue subject to third party product royalty costs coupled with the impact of certain fixed third party product royalty agreements which do not vary directly with license revenue 
amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired technology represents the amortization of capitalized technology associated with our acquisitions of encyc in and versametrix and market solutions in amortization of acquired technology decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of 
the decrease from to to was the result of an impairment recorded in the third quarter of relating to the carrying value of the acquired technology asset associated with versametrix  coupled with the completion of the amortization of acquired technology for market solutions in the third quarter of and the completion of the amortization of acquired technology for encyc in the fourth quarter of the acquired technology intangibles were fully amortized as of december  and as a result  there will be no further amortization of acquired technology in future periods  unless we complete additional acquisitions 
cost of support and service revenue cost of support and service revenue consists of personnel and third party service provider costs related to consulting services  customer support and training 
cost of support and service revenue decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and increased to million in  an increase of 
the decrease in dollar amount from to resulted primarily from a reduction in consulting personnel during to more closely align with our service revenue  as well as a decrease in the use of third party service providers  which have a higher cost structure than our internal resources 
the increase in dollar amount from to is due to a higher concentration of professional service revenue  which has a higher cost structure and contributes lower margins than support revenue 
full time headcount in our professional services organization was at the end of  at the end of  at the end of and at the end of 
table of contents cost of support and service revenue as a percentage of related support and service revenues was in  in and in the decrease in cost of service revenue as a percentage of related service revenue from to was due to a higher proportion of maintenance revenue  which has a lower direct cost structure and therefore contributes higher margins than our consulting and training services  coupled with a lower percentage use of third party service providers in our consulting engagements  which historically contributed significantly lower margins than internal resources 
the increase in cost of service revenue as a percentage of related service revenue from to primarily reflects a higher proportion of service revenue from consulting and training services  which have a higher direct cost structure and therefore contribute lower margins than our customer support services 
the cost of services as a percentage of service revenue may vary between periods primarily for two reasons the mix of services we provide consulting  customer support  training  which have different direct cost structures  and the resources we use to deliver these services internal versus third parties 
costs and expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  travel and promotional expenses and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in dollar amount from to and from to was primarily due to restructuring activities and reductions in sales and marketing headcounts  along with a decrease in sales commissions and bonuses 
full time headcount in our sales and marketing organization was at the end of  at the end of  at the end of and at the end of sales and marketing expenses represented of our total revenue in  in and in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue during these periods is primarily the result of cost cutting initiatives and lower license revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain flat in dollars in relative to to fully realize our long term sales growth opportunity  we believe that we may need to significantly increase our sales and marketing efforts  particularly in support of our vertical and embedded crm strategies  to expand our market position and further increase acceptance of our products 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and equipment for software developers  quality assurance personnel  program managers and technical writers and payments to outside contractors 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease from to was primarily due to a decrease in the use of outside contractors upon the release of our application on the oracle platform and our election to retain full time employees in lieu of contractors in our restructuring plan and  to a lesser extent  to a decrease in the number of development personnel 
the decrease from to was primarily due to a decrease in the use of outside contractors  and to a lesser extent  due to a decrease in the number of development personnel

we believe that our research and development investments are essential to our long term strategy 
we expect our research and development expenses to remain flat in dollars in relative to to fully realize our long term 
table of contents sales growth opportunity  we believe that we may need to increase our research and development investment in dollars in the future 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related costs for our executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  professional services fees and allowances for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of

the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to was due to reductions in executive and administrative personnel  along with a decrease in professional services fees and the benefit from collections of accounts previously believed to be uncollectible during the first and second quarters of full time headcount in our general and administrative organization was at the end of  at the end of  at the end of and at the end of general and administrative costs represented of our total revenue in  in and in although general and administrative expenses have been reduced through our restructuring efforts in recent periods  our general and administrative expenses may increase slightly in relative to as we incur additional professional services fees related to the satisfaction of new compliance requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of and incur costs associated with the recruitment and hiring of a new chief executive officer 
we also believe that we may need to expand our administrative staff  domestically and internationally  in the future to pursue our long term sales growth opportunities 
restructuring and other related charges restructuring and other related charges represent our efforts to reduce our overall cost structure 
in april and again in september  onyx approved a restructuring plans to reduce headcount  reduce infrastructure and eliminate excess and duplicate facilities 
in april  onyx approved a restructuring plan to reduce additional headcount 
during  we recorded approximately million in restructuring and other related charges 
during  we recorded approximately million in restructuring and other related charges 
during  we recorded approximately million in restructuring and other related charges 
the components of the charges recorded for the years ended december   and  are as follows in thousands excess employee excess facilities separation asset facilities warrants costs impairments other total charge for the year ended december  cash payments write offs balance at december  charge for the year ended december  cash payments write offs balance at december  charge for the year ended december  cash payments write offs fair value adjustment balance at december  
table of contents the excess facility charges recorded in and are the result of our decision to reduce our utilization of certain facilities and to terminate usage of certain domestic and international facilities altogether 
the most significant portion of the excess facility charges relates to our leases for  square feet of office space in bellevue  washington  which commenced in april and june of and were originally contracted to expire in and the partial lease termination agreement reached with bellevue hines development  llc  or hines  in december reduced our excess facilities in bellevue  washington by approximately  square feet 
onyx continues to lease approximately  square feet at this facility  which began serving as our new corporate headquarters effective at the end of january the new lease for  square feet expires in december the partial lease termination requires cash outflows of approximately million over the month period ending april  which is included in current restructuring related liabilities at december  in addition to cash payments  onyx issued three five year warrants to hines for the purchase of up to an aggregate of  shares of onyx common stock 
the warrant value as of december  was estimated at  based on a the estimated value of the warrants using the black scholes model with an expected dividend yield of  a risk free interest rate of  volatility of and an expected life of five years and b the estimated value of the cash cancellation payments in the event of a change in control 
the warrants are subject to variable accounting and we are required to mark the warrants to market at each reporting period 
at december   the warrant value was estimated at  using similar assumptions to those used at december   and is included in long term liabilities 
the accounting for excess facilities is complex and  as a result  may result in adjustments to our current restructuring charge 
in particular  based on the terms of the warrants issued in connection with the partial lease termination of excess facilities in bellevue  washington  the warrants are subject to variable accounting and will be marked to market at each reporting period 
future cash outlays are anticipated through july unless estimates and assumptions change or we are able to negotiate to exit certain leases at an earlier date 
the current portion of restructuring related liabilities totaled million at december   the long term portion of restructuring related liabilities totaled  at december  and the value of the warrants issued in connection with the termination of certain facility lease obligations was  at december  we are continuing to align our operations with our expected revenues and review our restructuring efforts 
we may  however  be unable to achieve these expense reductions without adversely affecting our business and operating results 
we may continue to experience losses and negative cash flows in the near term  unless sales of our products and services grow

deferred stock based compensation we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million in  representing the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire shares of common stock during and  prior to our initial public offering  and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the grant dates 
we recorded an additional million in deferred compensation in connection with the options granted to new employees in conjunction with the acquisition of revenuelab in january

other income expense  net was income of  in  expense of  in and income of  in the decrease in other income expense  net from to was primarily the result of an increase in bank fees and equity transaction related expenses that were not associated with the sale of securities recorded during  coupled with lower interest rates on marketable securities

at december   the remaining carrying value of private equity investments totaled  and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of  in  a provision of  in and a provision of  in the benefit recorded in resulted from the reduction of the deferred tax liability associated with the intangibles in connection with our acquisition of csn  which was fully impaired during the significant provision recorded in was primarily due to withholding taxes associated with the settlement of royalties due to our us entity by onyx japan  our japanese joint venture 
although these withholding taxes generate foreign tax credits  we have recorded a valuation allowance for nearly all of the deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance 
our income tax provision or benefit in all periods presented is primarily the net result of income taxes in connection with our foreign operations  offset by the deferred tax benefit recorded as we amortize the intangibles associated with our international acquisitions 
we made only insignificant provisions and recorded no benefit for federal or state income taxes in  or due to our historical operating losses  which resulted in deferred tax assets

indemnification and warranty provisions contained within our customer license and service agreements are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry 
the duration of our product warranties generally does not exceed days following delivery of our products 
we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas  accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fin we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
we have not incurred significant obligations under customer indemnification or warranty provisions historically and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future

the loan documents were further amended on january  to revise the tangible net worth covenant and the accounts receivable advance rates beginning with the month ended december  under the terms of these agreements  we have a total million working capital revolving line of credit with svb  which is split between a million domestic facility and a million exim bank facility 
both are secured by accounts receivable  property and equipment and intellectual property 
the domestic facility allows us to borrow up to the lesser of a of eligible domestic and individually approved foreign accounts receivable and b million 
the exim bank facility allows us to borrow up to the lesser of a of eligible foreign accounts receivable and b million 
if the borrowing base calculation falls below the outstanding standby letters of credit issued by svb on our behalf  svb may require us to cash secure the amount by which outstanding standby letters of credit exceed the borrowing base 
the amount required to be restricted under the loan agreement was million  measured as of december  due to the variability in our borrowing base  we may be subject to restrictions on our cash at various times throughout the year 
any borrowings will bear interest at svb s prime rate  which was as of december   plus  subject to a minimum rate of 
the loan agreements require us to maintain certain financial covenants based on its adjusted quick ratio and tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants  as amended  at december  absent the amendment  we would have been out of compliance with the loan agreement as of december  we are also prohibited under the loan and security agreements from paying dividends 
the facilities expire in march based on the outstanding standby letters of credit relating to long term lease obligations totaling million at december   no additional amounts are currently available under the credit facilities

table of contents long as we continue to be in compliance with the terms of our termination agreement and the surviving lease agreement with hines  the outstanding letter of credit with hines will be reduced in five equal monthly reductions of  ending in may as of the date of this filing  we are in the process of renewing our loan and security agreement with svb and expect the agreement to be renewed with terms that are acceptable to us 
if  however  we are unable to negotiate a new agreement with svb that has terms acceptable to us  we are unable to maintain compliance with our covenants in the future  or if svb decides to restrict our cash deposits  our liquidity would be further limited and our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed

table of contents we believe our future revenue performance will be comparable to the most recent quarterly periods reported and that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
accordingly  we believe that we have sufficient resources to continue as a going concern through at least december  should our revenue results for subsequent quarters fall below the results we achieved in the fourth quarter of  we would likely take action to restructure our operations to preserve our cash 
such actions would primarily consist of reductions in headcount 
due to the fact that lower cash balances could negatively impact our sales efforts  we may seek additional funds in the future through public or private equity financing or from other sources to fund our operations and pursue our growth strategy 
we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms  if at all 
any financing we might obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock and may dilute current shareholders ownership interest in onyx 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  in december  the fasb issued fin r with respect to variable interest entities created before january   which among other things  revised the implementation date to the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march   with the exception of special purpose entities 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which revises or rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
interest rate risk we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because all of our investments are short term in nature and are classified as cash equivalents as of december  due to the short term nature of these investments  their fair value would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
we do not use any hedging transactions or any financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
foreign currency risk in  international revenue accounted for of our consolidated revenues compared to in and in international revenue  as well as most of the related expenses incurred  is denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding country 
results of operations from our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars upon consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  revenues and other operating results
