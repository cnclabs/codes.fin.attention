the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview since  we have been a developer of storage products and services  focused on transforming how the marketplace stores and exchanges information 
we supply products and services that support data networks using advanced technologies  which we refer to as storage solutions 
a significant portion of our company has a technology focus and is dedicated to research and development 
we envision an information society where people will be able to connect and interact with information  simply and reliably  seamlessly accessing data services anywhere  anytime 
our operations are organized in two reportable segments storage solutions and telemanagement solutions 
our storage solutions are sold to a network of oem s  var s and si s under the nstor brand or the unique brand of respective distribution partners 
our telemanagement solutions are sold to large corporations  state and municipal governments  and other organizations with large and complex public  private and hybrid communications networks 
during the course of the past year  we have evolved our storage solutions business to be a provider of flexible  high performance and intelligent storage solutions 
the headquarters for our storage solutions business and our executive offices are presently located in carlsbad  california 
we also operate an engineering center in lake mary  florida for the design  development and testing of our storage enclosure and controller technologies 
our current product family includes applications driven storage platforms  raid controllers  and storage management software 
since our acquisition of dallas  texas based stonehouse technologies  inc in june  we have also been a provider of telemanagement solutions  including software and outsourcing solutions that help large enterprises manage their telecommunications expenses  assets and processes 
we believe that our storage solutions products enjoy an excellent reputation for innovation  quality  high performance technology and competitive pricing 
however  a number of significant challenges  including limited cash resources that restricted our ability to fund certain sales  marketing and other initiatives  certain personnel issues  as well as the downturn in the data storage industry and the economy in general  have resulted in our company incurring substantial net losses and prevented us from achieving net positive cash flows from operations 
our telemanagement solutions business  however  has not incurred net cash deficits since our acquisition and we expect this segment of our operations to generate positive cash flow in notwithstanding the historical cash deficits  we have recently experienced certain successes in our storage solutions business 
the following are key highlights during and early we experienced quarter to quarter increases in storage solutions sales revenues of and during the third quarter and second quarter  respectively  however  in the fourth quarter  revenues declined by which reflected a lower level of sales orders than anticipated from two of our major indirect customers 
we finished with storage solutions revenues of million  which approximated last year s storage solutions revenues of million 
we increased gross margins in from to primarily due to outsourcing the manufacturing of our nexstor family of products commencing in mid we also reduced our operating expenses by  or  by phasing out our manufacturing facility and relocating our executive and storage solutions business headquarters from san diego to a more economical facility in carlsbad at the end of from a product standpoint  we released our gbit fibre channel raid solutions in february  integrated into our high density u drive enclosure 
this product offering enables us to act as a single source storage solutions provider enclosure technology  raid controller and storage management software 
at the end of  we unveiled our sata series products  including fibre channel to sata and scsi to sata models  which are designed to bring cost effective  continuous data protection and advanced storage management to smb s 
the response to our sata product offering  and our strategy to deliver storage solutions which solve business problems  has been very positive and has resonated well with our customers 
we believe that several of our major customers are waiting until the full complement of our sata products are available for shipment  which contributed to the above mentioned decline in sales during the fourth quarter 
during  we announced a number of oem and reseller agreements with highly visible partners  including nec corporation and inno micro japan  pacific kc china  fujitsu europe and van gaever europe  and penguin computing  bitmicro networks and a fortune pc company and integrator of personalized technology solutions 
during march  we announced the signing of a value added reseller agreement with datacore  a leading independent software vendor specializing in storage control  management and consolidation 
during and through the end of february  we obtained million of debt and equity financing from private investors 
h 
irwin levy  our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and a significant shareholder  or companies controlled by him collectively mr 
levy provided million of this financing 
key challenges to improving revenues in include the ability to provide our existing major oem and reseller customers with the resources and assistance necessary for them to accelerate sales volumes to levels substantially above volumes  continue to design and develop innovative and competitive products  anticipate changing trends in customer demand  and integrate value added software into our hardware offerings which can be customized for enterprise customers  departmental workgroups and smb s across selected key vertical markets 
other major challenges are to continue to effectively manage our contract manufacturers  streamline operating costs and obtain adequate funds to cover our working capital needs until we begin to generate positive cash flows 
we have historically obtained such funds through equity and or debt capital from mr 
levy and other private investors 
since we presently have insufficient liquidity to fund our short term and long term operating needs  we are exploring various alternatives for raising capital  however  we cannot project with any degree of certainty that such funds will be available on terms that are acceptable 
going concern with respect to our consolidated financial statements  for the years ended december   and  we have received a going concern opinion from our auditors 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our recurring operating losses and our continued experience of negative cash flows from operating activities raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have insufficient liquidity to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months 
a going concern opinion indicates that although there is substantial doubt  the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
comparison of years ended december  and for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  as a result of our june acquisition of stonehouse see note to consolidated financial statements  we believe that the comparison between and may not be meaningful in certain respects 
we believe that a more appropriate measure of the underlying operating results of our business excludes non cash and non operational items as presented in the following table in thousands 
furthermore  management uses loss before non cash and non operational items internally as a measure of the performance of our operations 
loss before non cash and non operational items should be considered in addition to  and not as an alternative for  or superior to  net loss or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap

this reduction was more than offset by an overall increase in other indirect sales  primarily to foreign customers  generally concentrated in japan and china 
the higher proportion of indirect sales during the past several years is a direct result of our strategy to market our products primarily to oem s  var s and si s and to provide greater technological  marketing and sales support to those markets 
during  sales to three indirect customers represented of our storage solutions sales

during  we realized quarter to quarter increases in our storage solutions sales during the first three quarters  however  our fourth quarter storage solutions sales declined by from the third quarter 
the following table presents the quarterly storage solutions sales in thousands quarter sales first second third fourth total the primary reason for the fourth quarter decline was a lower level of sales orders than anticipated from two or our major indirect customers

positive gross margins were not achieved during the first half of primarily due to i the level of fixed costs inherent in our operations  coupled with lower revenues  and ii the price we paid for certain materials in connection with our series storage systems prior to the commencement of our contract manufacturer agreement for our new series 
as a result of outsourcing our production  we phased out our manufacturing facility in san diego  california during the third quarter of we expect storage solutions gross margins to continue to increase in we do not expect any significant change to our telemanagement solutions gross margins in our gross margins are dependent  in part  on product mix  which fluctuates from time to time 
our material costs are subject to fluctuations experienced during business cycles that create shortages and excess supplies of some critical components  thereby creating increases and decreases in costs

liquidity and capital resources the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
this contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as shown in the consolidated financial statements  we have experienced substantial net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  as well as negative cash flows from operations during those years 
in addition  we have negative working capital of million as of december   which includes borrowings of million from mr 
levy 
these matters  among others  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have achieved  however  certain success as a result of our efforts to i streamline our operations  ii establish the foundation for generating positive cash flow and operating profits  and iii obtain sufficient financing to cover our working capital needs 
we are currently evaluating our operations to further streamline our cost structure  enhance our sales and marketing strategies  and establish additional customer relationships  in an effort to boost revenues and reduce expenses 
previous efforts include cost reductions achieved from outsourcing the manufacturing of our storage solutions since mid and from the relocation of our executive and storage solutions business headquarters to a more economical facility in carlsbad  california in december the outsourcing contract has produced a significant improvement in gross margins by lowering manufacturing costs 
during  our storage solutions gross margin increased to compared to during in addition  the outsourcing allowed us to reduce our overall operating costs  principally as a result of the phase out of our manufacturing facility during the third quarter 
we have also reduced our direct sales personnel and other costs as part of our strategy to provide greater emphasis on indirect customer channels and to provide certain cost efficiencies 
since january  and through february   we obtained million of equity and debt financing from private investors  including million from mr 
levy 
in addition  in connection with our outsource manufacturing contract  mr 
levy has provided collateral for a bank to issue a million letter of credit  subsequently reduced to  for the benefit of the contract manufacturer 
during the year ended december   we converted an aggregate of million of borrowings including  in accrued interest into  shares of our common stock  of which million originated as borrowings during in november  we entered into an accounts receivable purchase agreement with a financial institution under which we may sell up to million of our accounts receivables related to our storage solutions business 
this agreement replaced a similar arrangement in effect since august with another financial institution  for a  line of credit 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to  we currently have insufficient liquidity to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months 
we are actively exploring alternatives for raising additional debt or equity capital to finance our short term and long term plans as well as operating deficits expected to be incurred until we begin to generate positive operating cash flows 
however  due to conditions in the technology related financial markets and other uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  there can be no assurances that such required additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  or that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the future 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern 
cash flow results our operating activities have historically produced net cash deficits 
in  the primary source of cash to fund million of net cash used in our operations was provided by million in net borrowings from private investors  including million from mr 
levy 
in  we borrowed million from mr 
levy and utilized million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities see note to consolidated financial statements to fund million of net cash used in our operations net of a million decrease in accounts receivable and million of net repayments under our revolving credit facilities 
in  we received million in debt and equity financing from private investors  including million from mr 
levy and million from mr 
halperin  and utilized million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities to fund million of net cash used in our operations and million of net repayments under our revolving credit facilities 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating leases capital leases estimated purchase obligations total our estimated purchase obligations are based on outstanding purchase orders at december   and principally represent agreements to purchase goods that are enforceable  legally binding and for which the following terms are known i the purchase price  ii the timing of the purchase  and iii the quantity of goods to be acquired 
critical accounting policies and estimates note to the consolidated financial statements describes significant accounting policies and applications used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we internally review these estimates and the underlying assumptions to assure they are appropriate for current circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
operating results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of results that may be reported for any other period 
management believes the following to be critical accounting policies  the application of which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition storage solutions revenues are recognized as of the date shipments are made to customers  net of an allowance for returns 
telemanagement solutions revenues from computer software sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery and acceptance of the software has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
consulting revenues are recognized when services are performed 
revenues on long term development contracts are deferred at time of sale  and using the percentage of completion method  are recognized based upon hours incurred as a percentage of estimated total hours 
maintenance revenues for customer support and product updates are deferred at the time of sale and are included in income on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement  generally for one year 
inventory valuation the business environment in which our storage solutions business operates is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we record reserves or direct write downs for components and products  which are determined to be obsolete  or are in excess of net realizable value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory each quarter  including a review of inventory on hand  sales forecasts  planned disposition of products  and existing development plans 
based on this analysis  we record an adjustment for excess and obsolete inventory  if necessary 
we may be required to record additional write downs if actual customer demand  component costs or product life cycles differ from our estimates  which could have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
in and  we recorded net write downs of  and million  respectively  resulting from obsolete inventory and components associated with products that were phased out 
in  we recorded a net reversal of previously written down inventory in the amount of  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness  the aging of such receivables and financial condition of those specific customers 
we record an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
we also record a general allowance for other non specific receivables based on a variety of factors 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make required payments  we may be required to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts  which could have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets our allocation of the stonehouse purchase price included million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
these values were based on a valuation analysis completed by an independent valuation firm 
the intangible assets identified were as follows i customer relationships approximately million  ii software  and iii non compete agreement  and are being amortized over ten  five and four years  respectively 
in addition  we have unamortized goodwill of approximately million that arose from an acquisition in goodwill is tested for possible impairment at least on an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on impairment analysis prepared by an independent valuation firm in early  our goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of january  research and development costs r d costs associated with our storage solutions business are expensed as incurred 
r d costs associated with our telemanagement solutions business for software production are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
thereafter  software production costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
amortization commences only when the product is available for general release and is recorded as amortization to cost of sales rather than r d costs 
capitalized software costs are amortized over the greater of i the estimated economic life on the straight line method  or ii the ratio that current revenues for the product bears to the total current and anticipated future revenues for the product 
capitalized software development costs amounted to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized software development costs amounted to  in there was no amortization of capitalized software costs in effects of inflation during recent years  inflation has not had an impact on our operations and we do not expect that it will have a material impact in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a floating interest rate revolving credit facility for our telemanagement solutions business  outstanding balance at december  
therefore  we are subject to market risk arising from increases to the prime rate
