increasing global competition  shorter product life cycles  more demanding customers and higher standards are forcing businesses to provide improved levels of customer service while shortening the time it takes to bring their products and services to market 
many companies now operate and distribute their products on a global basis  which has substantially increased the complexities of their demand and supply chains 
in order to meet these challenges  companies are demanding greater visibility of their operations throughout their own organization and their extended trading networks and enhanced capabilities to make and execute decisions in response to rapidly changing conditions 
effective demand and supply chain management solutions allow companies to share information throughout their own organizations and extended trading networks and to monitor  measure and improve their business processes over time 
they also enable responsive  rapid and informed decision making 
these capabilities make companies more competitive and profitable in this increasingly complex environment 
we also believe that companies must pursue the further integration of the supply side and demand side of their businesses to most effectively respond to these challenges and take advantage of the opportunities these challenges create 
many companies are also seeking information technology solutions based on open standards that operate in a fast  effective and secure environment and can be integrated with their existing systems and those systems of companies in their trading networks 
they require that these solutions provide quick realization of benefits and rapid return on their investment 
the competition in these markets includes enterprise application software companies  such as erp companies  supply chain management companies  pricing and revenue management companies and other information technology services companies  in addition to software solutions custom developed within the user company 
information technology companies are engaging offshore global workforces on an increasing basis to take advantage  in part  of technical expertise and lower personnel costs  including in india and china  either through their own or out sourced operations to provide development  consulting and implementation services

our strategy to achieve our objective includes the following elements expand and differentiate our solutions we intend to extend the capabilities and scope of our scm and our drm solutions to help solve a broader range of evolving business challenges and to improve operational and business processes within and among companies 
we believe the emerging market for solutions that simultaneously leverage supply chain management and demand and revenue management will be a large and important market  and that our industry domain expertise and extensive solution capabilities differentiate us from our competitors 
we also believe that there is a significant opportunity to apply revenue and price management solutions to manufacturing and other non reservation based industries 
our capabilities are enhanced by our relationships with clients  industry experts and third party alliances  which we believe will work to our advantage as we develop and expand our solutions 
provide advanced technological innovation using our extensive experience and domain expertise  plus our commitment of substantial resources for research and development  we develop advanced technological software solutions and offer them to our clients and prospects 
in addition  we will consider tactical and strategic acquisitions of other companies and technologies  if we are able to do so on terms favorable to us  in order to shorten the time it takes us to bring solutions to market  to further differentiate ourselves from our competitors and to enhance or expand our existing offerings

certain enterprise resource planning vendors  in addition to sap  have acquired or developed demand and supply chain management software  products  or functionality or have announced intentions to develop and sell demand and supply chain management solutions 
such vendors include oracle  peoplesoft and ssa global technologies 
the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality  domain expertise  integration technologies  product suite integration  breath of products and related services such as customer support and implementation services

we believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive  integrated solutions  our list of referenceable clients  the ability of our solutions to generate business benefits for clients  our substantial investment in product development  our domain expertise in our markets  our quick implementations  rapid paybacks and large returns on investment  our client support services and our extensive knowledge of supply chain management and demand and revenue management solutions 
software license  support and implementation service agreements and pricing software revenue consists principally of fees generated from licenses of our software products 
in consideration of the payment of license fees  we generally grant nonexclusive  nontransferable  perpetual licenses  which are primarily business unit  user specific and geographically restricted 
software license fee arrangements vary depending upon the type of software product s being licensed and the customer s computer environment 
software license fees are based primarily on which products are licensed  the size and complexity of the customer problem being addressed  the size of the client s business and the number of users and locations 
the amount of software license fees may reach many millions of dollars for initiatives that are very large in scope and complexity 
clients may obtain solution support for an annual fee 
we have three levels of support that our customers choose from to best accommodate their needs standard  premium and signature 
support fees are calculated on an escalated scale  based on the level of service chosen and the size of the related software license fees 
support fees are generally billed annually and are subject to changes in support list prices 
we also provide implementation services  systems administration  training and hosting of our software applications and other related services  generally on a time and materials basis 
this allows our clients to determine the level of support or services appropriate for their needs 
proprietary rights and licenses we regard our software as proprietary 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures and agreements and provisions to help protect proprietary rights in our products 
we distribute our software under software license agreements  which typically grant clients nonexclusive  nontransferable licenses to our products and have perpetual terms unless the term is limited or the license is terminated for breach 
under such typical license agreements  we retain all rights to market our products  which afford limited protections 
manugistics owns five issued us patents and numerous pending patent applications including a number of allowed claims in both the united states and in various foreign countries or regions 
the latest of these issued us patents will endure until with the earliest enduring until any patent issued may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not challenged  may not be issued with the scope of claims we seek  if at all 
manugistics also owns a number of active trademark registrations including those for the mark manugistics among others and pending trademark applications in the united states and in various foreign countries or regions 
manugistics trademark registrations will endure until their subject marks cease to be used or the registrations are otherwise not renewed 
trademark applications are subject to review by the issuing authority  may be opposed by private parties  and may not issue 
we also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as an unpublished  copyrighted work 
use of our software is usually restricted to the internal operations of our clients and to designated users 
in sales to virtual service providers  the licensed software is restricted to the internal operations of our client and to designated users 
use is subject to terms and conditions that prohibit unauthorized reproduction or transfer of the software 
we also rely  in part  on technology that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our software products to perform key functions 
for example  we license reporting software from cognos  inc  application integration software from business objects  application integration software from vignette  inc and an application platform suite of software from bea systems  inc  on terms we believe to be commercially reasonable 
we also license software for non key functions from one or more technology vendors that we embed and ship with our software on terms we believe to be commercially reasonable 
typically  these licenses are worldwide  non exclusive and royalty based 
the license agreements typically have terms of two to five years  and automatically renew for one year terms unless terminated in accordance with their terms 
if we are unable to continue to license certain of this software on commercially reasonable terms  including the reporting software from cognos and the application platform suite from bea systems  we may face delays in releases of certain of our software solutions until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our current product 
these delays  if they occur  may seriously harm our business 
the royalties paid under these licenses were  in aggregate  less than of our total revenue in each of our  and fiscal years

business environment and factors impacting our fiscal results our operating results for fiscal were affected by several broad based factors including global macro economic conditions and cautious capital spending by corporations  especially for certain information technology related items  such as enterprise application software 
this represented a continuation of the challenging market conditions faced by us and other enterprise application software companies in fiscal and fiscal over the past three fiscal years  we have faced challenges in our ability to stabilize revenue and operating performance and to expand market share as global economic conditions resulted in deterioration in the markets for our products and services 
as a result  organizations in our target markets intensified their efforts to identify and realize potential cost savings  in part  by sharply restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs 
in addition  in the years preceding the global economic slowdown  many corporations made capital expenditures in anticipation of future growth that did not materialize  thereby reducing their current capital expenditure needs 
in response to these weak economic conditions  we enacted a number of cost containment and cost reduction measures over the past two years to better align our cost structure with expected revenue  including reducing our direct employee workforce by across the organization  from a peak of  employees at may  to employees at february   reducing our office space  consistent with our reduced employee headcount  and increasing the proportion of our product development work performed by third party contractors in india in order to take advantage of cost efficiencies associated with india s lower wage scale 
the following is a summary of some of the key external factors impacting our operating performance during fiscal economy we believe that our operating results for any time period are significantly affected by global macro economic conditions 
beginning late in calendar through the first half of calendar  global economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe  deteriorated or stabilized at depressed levels 
further  we believe that geopolitical uncertainties related to the war on terrorism and hostilities in the middle east exacerbated the general cautiousness of corporations to embark on major capital spending initiatives in the face of unprecedented uncertainties 
during the second half of our fiscal  economic conditions began to show signs of modest improvement 
our operating results in fiscal mirrored the timing of economic recovery 
for instance  our software revenue increased compared to the prior year quarter in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  compared to year over year declines in the first two quarters of fiscal capital spending environment according to the bureau of economic analysis of the us department of commerce  information technology capital spending which includes computer hardware and software increased consecutive years from and then declined in both calendar years and by approximately and  respectively the first consecutive annual declines in information technology capital spending ever 
the same agency reports that information technology capital spending increased by approximately during calendar with progressive improvement in each calendar quarter 
we believe it is still too early to know whether the recent improvement in general economic conditions and the capital spending environment will continue 
summary of fiscal operating results and financial metrics as we entered fiscal  market conditions continued to be challenging 
certain industries have been more or less likely to invest in enterprise application software depending on the condition of their business and industry 
our customers generally licensed fewer software modules in fiscal than in past years 
we have not lost any major customers or contracts in recent quarters that had a negative material impact on revenue 
our cost containment and cost reduction measures enacted in fiscal and fiscal have lessened the adverse impact on our financial performance of our declining revenue resulting from sustained depressed levels of capital spending on enterprise application software 
from the fiscal year ended february  to the fiscal year ended february   our employee workforce decreased from  employees to employees  or across the organization  while total revenue declined compared to the same period 
key financial metrics fiscal despite the challenging market conditions faced by the company during fiscal  we have improved many of our key financial metrics and performance indicators  particularly during the second half of fiscal  such as software revenue compared to the second half of fiscal  revenue per employee and our financial condition and liquidity 
year ended february  year ended february  q q q q in thousands  except number of employees revenue software support services reimbursed expenses total revenue operating expenses and employee headcount restructuring  lease abandonment  goodwill impairment and acquisition related expenses all other operating expenses total operating expenses total employees period end total average employees total revenue per average employees financial condition  liquidity and capital structure cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments convertible debt total stockholders equity common shares outstanding period end cash flows from operating activities includes restructuring charges  lease abandonment charges and goodwill impairment charges plus acquisition related expenses such as amortization of acquired technology and intangibles  non cash stock option based compensation expense and purchased research and development charges 
includes cost of software  cost of support and services  cost of reimbursed expenses  sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative costs 
the following is a brief discussion of the above financial metrics and analysis of the reasons for the change between fiscal and fiscal and recent trends 
software revenue our software revenue stabilized during fiscal  declining modestly by during fiscal to million 
the following table highlights some of the significant trends impacting our software revenue average significant selling price software software asp transactions quarter ended transactions in s million or greater may  august  november  february  may  august  november  february  fiscal total fiscal total significant software transactions are those with a value of  or greater recognized within the fiscal quarter 
software revenue by industry for fiscal and is as follows year ended february  government  aerospace and defense consumer packaged goods retail communications and high technology other the previous tables indicate the following trends impacting our software revenue over the past two fiscal years the company experienced three consecutive quarters of a declining number of significant software transactions consummated beginning with the quarter ended november  through the quarter ended may  we believe this time period represented the low point in demand for our software products as the capital spending environment for enterprise application software had not yet improved to levels consistent with the general economic recovery during that same time period 
during the final three quarters of fiscal  the number of significant software transactions consummated increased significantly compared to the previous three quarters to more normalized levels 
the average selling price of software has been relatively stable during the past seven quarters 
excluding the quarters ended february  and may   asp has ranged from  to  the quarters ended february  and may  included software revenue from installments under a large multi year government contract 
the concentration of software revenue from the government  aerospace and defense sector increased significantly in fiscal as a result of i continued spending by the us department of defense on business modernization initiatives  including procuring and installing commercial off the shelf software  such as supply chain management software  to replace legacy applications and processes and ii increased sales to aerospace and defense customers acquired in the acquisition of western data systems of nevada  inc wds in april total significant software license transactions consummated increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal this is indicative of a modestly improving capital spending environment  as more clients are engaged in software initiatives 
asp for software declined during fiscal compared to fiscal as previously noted  customers are generally licensing fewer software modules than in past years or expanding the scope of use of previously licensed products  resulting in a lower asp 
support revenue our support revenue increased in fiscal to million due to support renewal rates in excess of among our existing client base and new support agreements entered into in conjunction with new software license agreements 
services and reimbursed expense revenue our services and reimbursed expense revenue decreased in fiscal to million  primarily due to the decline in software revenue of in fiscal and the resulting lag effect on services revenue that began during the second half of fiscal other factors that affected services revenue included reduced hourly billing rates and an increase in implementation work performed by customers and or other consulting organizations 
total revenue per employee our total revenue per employee increased by to  in fiscal calculated as total revenue for the year divided by average employees for the year and improved steadily during fiscal to  on an annualized basis during the fourth quarter calculated as total revenue for the quarter divided by average employees for the quarter multiplied by four 
these increases were primarily due to reduced employee headcount and improved productivity from revenue generating employees sales  support and implementation services personnel 
total operating expenses our total operating expenses declined by during fiscal to million 
restructuring  lease abandonment  goodwill impairment and acquisition related expenses declined during fiscal to million 
this decrease was the result of the absence of goodwill impairment charges in fiscal million in fiscal 
all other operating expenses declined during fiscal to million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in average employee headcount as a result of the and restructurings and normal attrition 
other notable cost decreases included reduced office space costs as a result of the and restructurings  lower outside contractor costs in both the product development and consulting services areas and lower bad debt expense see critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts 
all other operating expenses declined sequentially each quarter during fiscal as a result of continuing cost reduction and cost containment measures 
financial condition  liquidity and capital structure during fiscal  we made significant improvements in our financial condition  liquidity and capital structure 
highlights include the following convertible debt balance was reduced by million to million through the issuance of million shares of common stock in debt for equity exchange transactions 
this increased stockholder s equity by million 
cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments increased by million to million primarily as a result of positive cash flows from operations and eliminating restricted cash by negotiating more favorable credit facility terms with a new commercial lender 
we reduced our convertible debt to equity ratio from at february  to at february  primarily as a result of debt for equity exchange transactions described above 
outlook fiscal as we enter fiscal  the business environment appears to be stable to modestly improving 
uncertainty in macro economic conditions and the capital spending environment persists to some extent  making it difficult to precisely predict the demand for our software and services 
while we are cautiously optimistic that economic conditions will continue to improve and result in stronger information technology capital spending environment during the second half of our fiscal  it is still too early to predict what impact this may have on our revenue and operating performance 
we expect all other operating expenses for the first half of fiscal to be similar to the second half of fiscal our expectations regarding expense levels may vary depending on future revenue levels 
if demand for our products and services increases during the second half of fiscal  we would expect all other operating expenses to increase from recent levels as a result of i increases in employee compensation through merit increases and incentive payments  under certain circumstances  ii increases in number of employees to meet increased demand for software and implementation services and iii increases in expenses that vary directly with revenue  such as sales commissions  third party royalties and bad debt expense 
since a significant portion of our software license agreements close in the latter part of each quarter  management may not be able to adjust our cost structure in the short term to respond to lower than expected revenue  which may adversely impact our operating performance in the future 
we expect that our other expenses  net primarily interest expense  will decrease approximately million in fiscal from fiscal levels as a result of reducing our convertible debt balance by million during the second half of fiscal our annual interest expense was reduced by million as a result of reducing our convertible debt balance to million from million 
during fiscal  we reported million basic and diluted weighted shares outstanding for our loss per share calculation 
as a result of the convertible debt for equity exchange transactions  we had million shares outstanding as of february  accordingly  we expect our basic and diluted weighted shares outstanding to increase to at least million during fiscal  or approximately 
during april  we signed a lease termination agreement with the landlord of our facility in metropolitan chicago  illinois 
this space was substantially unused as a result of past restructuring activity 
the lease termination agreement required us to pay approximately million in cash at signing in exchange for terminating our lease agreement that would have expired in fiscal as of february   based on management s best estimate of the remaining liability  the company had accrued restructuring obligations of approximately million related to this facility 
we will record a restructuring benefit of approximately million during the quarter ended may  as a result of the lease termination agreement

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates made by management with respect to these and other items that require management s estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software development costs  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill  income taxes  restructuring and lease abandonment related expenses and stock based compensation plans 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to the audited financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue our revenue consists of software license revenue  services revenue  support revenue and reimbursed expenses 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletins and  revenue recognition sab  sab 
software license revenue  services revenue and support revenue are generally recognized when the four basic criteria of sop  sab and sab are met as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered delivery occurs when media containing the licensed program is provided to a common carrier fob shipping point or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the license fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and is payable within months of the agreement date 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
we consider services fees to be fixed or determinable if the services fee or rates for time and material contracts are not subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable we perform a credit review for all significant transactions at the time the arrangement is executed to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer recognition of the revenue until collection 
if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  recognition of the software revenue is deferred until the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements using the residual method  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
each software license arrangement requires careful review to identify each individual element and to assess vsoe of fair value of those elements to determine the proper amount of software revenue to be recorded 
vsoe of fair value for support services is provided by the renewal rate 
vsoe of fair value for implementation services is based upon separate sales of services at stated hourly rates by level of consultant 
under the residual method  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue when the basic criteria in sop and sab and have been met 
typically  payments for software licenses are due within twelve months of the agreement date 
when software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the agreement date  software revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in addition to evaluating the vsoe of fair value of each element of an arrangement  we also consider whether such elements can be separated into separate units of accounting in accordance with sop when making this determination  we consider the nature of services provided  when purchased with a software license ie  consideration of whether services are essential to the functionality of software products licensed  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors and timing of payments  among other things 
when we provide services deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software products licensed or the licensed software requires significant production  modification or customization  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in these cases  software revenue is deferred and recognized based on labor hours incurred to date compared to total estimated labor hours for the contract 
implementation services are separately priced and sold  are generally available from a number of suppliers and typically are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
implementation services  which include project management  systems planning  design and implementation  customer configurations and training are billed on an hourly basis time and materials or under fixed price contracts 
implementation services are recognized as the work is performed 
on fixed price contracts  services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating labor hours incurred to date to total estimated labor hours 
in the event services are billed in advance of work being performed  the billed amount is initially recorded as deferred services revenue and recognized as services revenue when the work is performed 
recently  the proportion of services engagements under fixed fee arrangements has increased relative to prior periods 
we expect the proportion of services engagements under fixed fee arrangements to fluctuate in future periods 
accordingly  our reported revenue and operating performance may be subject to increased levels of estimates and uncertainties in future periods 
the process of estimation inherent in the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue is subject to judgments and uncertainties and may affect the amounts of software and services revenue under certain contracts and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates to complete client engagements  including skill level and experience of project managers  staff assigned to engagements and continuity and attrition level of implementation consulting staff 
changes in the estimated stage of completion of a particular project could create variability in our revenue and results of operations if we are required to increase or decrease previously recognized revenue related to a particular project or if we expect to incur a loss on the project 
support revenue includes post contract customer support and the rights to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements 
customer support is generally billed annually  initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as support revenue ratably over the support period 
allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three years in the period ended february   our provision for doubtful accounts has ranged between approximately and of total revenue 
for fiscal  our provision for doubtful accounts was of revenue 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue from prior periods resulted from improved collections experience  improved write off history and improved accounts receivable aging 
we initially record the provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience of write offs and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivable  historical write off experience  the credit worthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of the company s future provision for doubtful accounts 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
based on our total revenue reported for fiscal  our provision for doubtful accounts would change by approximately million annually for a change in proportion of total revenue 
the provision for doubtful accounts is included in sales and marketing expense for software license receivables and cost of services and support for services and support fees receivable  in the consolidated statement of operations 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize the development cost of software  other than internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients 
software development costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  commencing with the date the product is first available for general release 
generally  an economic life of two years is used to amortize capitalized software development costs 
in future periods  if we determine that technological feasibility occurs at a later date  such as coincident with general product release to clients  we may not capitalize any software development costs 
this would increase our reported operating expenses in the short term by the amounts we do not capitalize 
the amounts of software development costs that we have capitalized have ranged between million and million per year during our last three fiscal years 
the estimated economic life of our capitalized software development costs is subject to change in future periods based on our experience with the length of time our products or enhancements are being or are expected to be used 
the amortization of software development costs have ranged between million and million per year during our last three fiscal years 
a change in the expected economic life of our capitalized software development costs of six months increase or decrease would change our annual operating expenses by approximately million to million 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and software developed for internal use  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we assess recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group 
if we determine that a long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and the fair value of the asset or asset group 
we generally measure fair value of an asset or asset group based on projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in addition  at each reporting date  we compare the net realizable value of capitalized software development costs to the unamortized capitalized costs 
to the extent the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value  the excess amount is written off 
other identifiable intangible assets  including acquired technology  customer relationships and software developed for internal use  are amortized over periods ranging from two to seven years 
evaluating long lived assets for impairment involves judgments as to when an asset may potentially be impaired 
we consider there to be a risk of impairment if there is a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  if there is a significant change in the extent or intended use of an asset  or if actual or projected operating losses indicate continuing losses from an asset used to produce revenue 
during fiscal  and  we recorded impairment losses for property and equipment and software developed for internal use associated with restructuring and lease abandonment activities 
see restructuring and lease abandonment related expenses in this section for further detail and note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have not recorded any impairment losses associated with identifiable intangible assets during the last three fiscal years 
as of february  our net book value of long lived assets  consisted of the following in thousands property and equipment software development costs software developed for internal use goodwill acquired technology customer relationships total the estimated economic useful lives of our long lived assets are subject to change in future periods based upon the intended use of the asset or period of time revenues are expected to be generated 
during the quarter ended february   we reduced the useful life of our talus customer relationship asset to five years from seven years based on the reduced levels of revenue from customers that existed at the time of the talus acquisition in december this will result in increased amortization of intangibles of approximately million in fiscal in addition  effective march   we will prospectively increase the depreciable lives of purchased computer and related equipment to three years from two years due to increased periods of time such assets have been used in the past and expected future use 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  the company s market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility below our carrying value 
please see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business 
we performed our fiscal goodwill impairment review on february  and determined that the implied fair value of the company exceeded the carrying value 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment charge was recorded during fiscal we performed goodwill impairment reviews during our second and third quarters of fiscal due to a decrease in market capitalization  and no impairment losses were recognized 
we performed a test for goodwill impairment as of february   our annual date for goodwill impairment review  and determined that our implied fair value was less than stockholders equity  including goodwill  an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
therefore  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
the goodwill impairment loss was determined by calculating the difference between a our implied fair value as of february  less the fair value of our net assets and b the carrying value of goodwill 
the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets of the company were determined by an independent valuation 
our implied fair value was estimated based on the closing quoted market price of our common stock on february  multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares market capitalization plus an implied control premium as if we were owned by a single stockholder 
the implied control premium used for purposes of measuring the implied fair value of the company was determined by review of the premiums paid by other companies in past public technology and software acquisitions 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill involves judgments as to when an impairment may exist  as well as estimates used to compute the implied fair value 
if the estimates used to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill were to change such that the fair value dropped below stockholders equity  this could result in an impairment charge for some or all of our goodwill balance in future periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the valuation allowance we have recorded 
based on various factors  including our cumulative losses for fiscal  and when adjusted for non recurring items  operating performance in fiscal and estimates of future profitability  management has concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover our net deferred tax assets as of february  based on similar analysis in fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  which resulted in a million charge to income tax expense in the fiscal year ended february  management will continue to monitor its estimates of future profitability and realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
also  as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our full year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can impact our overall income tax expense 
this process involves estimating our current tax liabilities in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
restructuring and lease abandonment related expenses our restructuring and lease abandonment charges are comprised primarily of i severance and associated employee benefits related to the involuntary reduction of our workforce  ii lease termination costs  costs associated with permanently vacating facilities abandonment or both  and iii impairment charges for long lived assets related to lease abandonments 
prior to december   we accounted for the costs associated with the reduction of our workforce in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
accordingly  we recorded the liability related to involuntary termination costs when the following conditions were met i management with the appropriate level of authority approved a termination plan that committed us to such plan and established the benefits the employees would receive upon termination  ii the benefit arrangement was communicated to the employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the termination benefits  iii the plan specifically identified the number of employees to be terminated  their locations  and their job classifications  and iv the period of time to implement the plan did not indicate changes to the plan were likely 
the termination costs we record are not associated with  nor do they benefit  continuing activities 
prior to december   we accounted for lease termination costs in accordance with eitf accordingly  we recorded the costs associated with lease termination  abandonment or both when the following conditions were met i management with the appropriate level of authority approved a termination plan that committed us to such plan  ii the plan specifically identified all activities that would not be continued  including the method of disposition and location of those activities  and the expected date of completion  iii the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan were likely  and iv the leased property had no substantive future use or benefit to us 
we recorded the liability associated with lease termination  abandonment or both as the sum of the total remaining lease costs and related exit costs  less probable sublease income or the expected lease termination fees or penalties 
we accounted for costs related to long lived assets abandoned in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas and  accordingly  charged to expense the net carrying value of the long lived assets when we ceased to use the assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas on january  sfas nullifies eitf and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf and also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
accordingly  for exit or disposal activities undertaken after december   we recorded the liability related to involuntary termination costs  lease termination costs  lease abandonment costs and relocation costs as they were incurred 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish lease abandonments 
changing business and real estate market conditions may affect the assumptions related to the timing and extent of our ability to sublease vacated space 
we review the status of restructuring liabilities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  we record changes to our restructuring liabilities based on management s most current estimates 
lease termination costs are required to be recognized and measured at fair value when we terminate lease agreements 
stock based compensation plans we account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no

stock options granted had weighted average fair values of  and per share  respectively  for fiscal  and respectively  as calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
the weighted average estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights granted under our employee stock purchase plan during fiscal  and was  and per share  respectively 
the employee stock purchase plan program was no longer active as of february  we determined the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock options and stock purchase plan shares by estimating the expected useful lives  giving consideration to the vesting and purchase periods  contractual lives  actual employee forfeitures  and the relationship between the exercise price and the fair market value of our common stock  among other factors 
the risk free interest rate is the us treasury bill rate for the relevant expected life 
the fair value of stock options and stock purchase plan shares was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions options espp risk free interest rates expected term years years years months months months volatility revenue software revenue 
software revenue decreased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal our software revenue stabilized during fiscal year  with a modest decrease 
the decrease in software revenue and software revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the continued weakness of the global economy and geopolitical uncertainties in our fiscal and the related decline in spending for enterprise application software by businesses 
this resulted in a decrease in the asp for our software during fiscal and a decrease in the number of significant software license transactions consummated during fiscal the following table summarizes significant software transactions consummated during fiscal  and fiscal year ended february or  significant software transactions number of transactions  to  number of transactions million and greater total number of transactions average selling price in thousands significant software transactions are those with a value of  or greater recognized within the fiscal year 
the modest decrease in software revenue in fiscal was due to a continued decline in the asp offset by an increase in the number of smaller significant software transactions and increased software revenue from transactions accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
services revenue 
services revenue decreased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in services revenue in fiscal and fiscal was the result of the decrease in the number of completed software license transactions in fiscal and fiscal and resulting lower demand for implementation services  offset by the services revenue from wds which was acquired in april services revenue tends to track software license revenue in prior periods 
support revenue 
support revenue increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the increase in support revenue in fiscal and fiscal was due to the increase in the base of clients that have licensed our software products and entered into annual support arrangements coupled with net renewals of annual support agreements by our existing client base and the wds acquisition 
in the past  we have experienced high rates of renewed annual support contracts 
there can be no assurance that our historical renewal rate will continue 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
geographic revenue 
we market and sell our software and services internationally  primarily in europe  asia  canada  central america and south america 
revenue outside of the united states increased  or million  to million in fiscal and decreased  or million  to million in fiscal revenue outside of the united states as a percentage of total revenue was  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in our international revenue in fiscal was due to improved sales execution in europe and growth in the emerging markets of asia pacific 
in fiscal within the americas region  a significant portion of our software and total revenue was derived from our government  aerospace defense customers  offsetting softness in the remainder of the americas 
the decrease in our international revenue in fiscal resulted from the progressive weakening of global economic conditions  especially in the european economies  and geopolitical uncertainties  which resulted in delayed and smaller buying decisions by prospects and customers for our products 
operating expenses cost of software 
cost of software consists primarily of amortization of capitalized software development costs and royalty fees associated with third party software either embedded in our software or resold by us 
the following table sets forth amortization of capitalized software development costs and other costs of software for the three fiscal years ended february or   and in thousands fiscal year ended february or  amortization of capitalized software percentage of software revenue other costs of software percentage of software revenue total cost of software percentage of software revenue the decrease in cost of software in fiscal was a result of decreased amortization of capitalized software and decreased royalties paid to third parties as a result of a slight decrease in software revenue and changes in the mix of products licensed 
the decrease in amortization of capitalized software was due to product release becoming fully amortized in fiscal while product release in fiscal was completed in february resulting in no incremental amortization in fiscal the decrease in cost of software in fiscal was the result of decreased royalty fees due to lower software revenue 
amortization of capitalized software development costs does not vary with software revenue while royalty fees do 
amortization of acquired technology 
in connection with acquisitions in fiscal  and  we acquired developed technology that we offer as part of our integrated solutions 
acquired technology is amortized over periods ranging from four to six years 
we expect annual amortization of acquired technology to be approximately million in fiscal cost of services and support 
cost of services and support primarily includes personnel and third party contractor costs 
cost of services and support as a percentage of related revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal cost of services and support decreased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in cost of services and support was attributable to an overall decrease in the average number of services and support employees to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this was a result of the implementation of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives during fiscal and fiscal and improved utilization rates for consulting services employees in fiscal the decrease in cost of services and support as a percentage of related revenue in fiscal reflects an increase in the proportion of this revenue derived from support services  which historically have higher margins than implementation services 
cost of services and support increased  or million  in fiscal the increase in cost of services and support during fiscal was attributable to an increase in support royalties paid to third parties and the wds acquisition in april  offset by the implementation of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives during fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  promotional events such as user conferences  trade shows and technical conferences  advertising and public relations programs 
sales and marketing expense decreased  or million in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal and fiscal was due to an overall decrease in the average number of sales  marketing and business development employees to for fiscal compared to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  which was the result of cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  a decrease in promotional spending  travel  advertising and public relations spending resulting from cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  and in fiscal  a decrease in sales commissions due to lower software revenue 
product development 
product development costs include expenses associated with the development of new software products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities and are reported net of capitalized software development costs 
such costs are primarily from employees and third party contractors 
the following table sets forth product development costs for the three fiscal years ended february or   and in thousands fiscal year ended february or  gross product development costs percentage of total revenue less capitalized software development costs percentage of total revenue product development costs  as reported percentage of total revenue gross product development costs decreased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal and was due to further consolidation of our us product development function to our corporate headquarters in rockville  maryland  an overall decrease in the average number of product development employees to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this was a result of the implementation of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives during fiscal and fiscal  an increase in the proportion of our development work being performed by contractors in india in order to take advantage of cost efficiencies associated with india s lower wage scale  and a decrease in the average number of contractors in the united states resulting from cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in fiscal the decrease was offset in part by an increase in gross product development costs resulting from the wds acquisition in april general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs of our legal  finance  accounting  human resources  facilities and information systems functions 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal and was due to a decrease in the average number of general and administrative employees resulting from cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in the fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  offset by an increase in costs resulting from the wds acquisition in april amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairment 
our past acquisitions resulted in our recording goodwill and other intangible assets that represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from four to seven years 
amortization of intangibles increased million in fiscal as a result of the change in the talus customer relationships amortization from seven years to five years in fiscal amortization of intangibles decreased by  or million  in fiscal the fiscal decrease resulted from our adoption of sfas on march   which requires that we no longer amortize goodwill and assembled workforce 
sfas also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis and when there is reason to suspect that values may have been impaired 
we performed a test for goodwill impairment as of february   our annual date for goodwill impairment review and determined a write down was necessary 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions down to their estimated fair value 
details of our amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairment are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and details of our acquisitions are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
purchased research and development 
our acquisition of wds in fiscal included the purchase of technology that had not yet been determined to be technologically feasible and had no alternative future use at its then current stage of development 
accordingly  in fiscal the portion of the purchase price for wds allocated to purchased research and development of million in aggregate  was expensed immediately in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
details of our acquisitions are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
restructuring and lease abandonment charges 
in order to better align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels  we adopted restructuring plans in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and in the second and third quarters of fiscal in connection with our decision to implement these plans  we incurred related restructuring and lease abandonment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the following table sets forth a summary of restructuring and lease abandonment charges  net of adjustments  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in thousands fiscal year ended february or  lease obligations and terminations severance and related benefits impairment charges other total restructuring and lease abandonment charges the impact to reported basic and diluted loss per share as a result of the restructuring and lease abandonment charges was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
over the past three fiscal years  we have faced challenges in our ability to stabilize revenue and operating performance and to expand market share as global economic conditions resulted in deterioration in the markets for our products and services 
in response to these weak economic conditions  we have enacted a number of cost containment and cost reduction measures over the past three years to better align our cost structure with expected revenue 
specifically  we took the following actions we reduced our workforce by  and employees through involuntary terminations with the fiscal  and restructurings  respectively 
we further consolidated our product development function in the united states to the corporate headquarters in rockville  maryland as part of the restructuring plans in fiscal  and this included the relocation of certain employees from wayne  pennsylvania  san carlos  california  atlanta  georgia  denver  colorado and ottawa  canada to rockville  maryland 
as a result of the workforce reductions  product development consolidation and employee attrition  certain of our facilities were under utilized 
accordingly  we consolidated our remaining workforce in the under utilized facilities and ceased to utilize the then vacated office space 
the facilities permanently removed from our operations during fiscal  and were located in wayne  pennsylvania  irving  texas  detroit  michigan  denver  colorado  ratigen  germany  ottawa  canada  and milan  italy 
a portion of the office space was permanently vacated in certain facilities located in rockville  maryland  chicago  illinois  atlanta  georgia  calabasas and san carlos  california  and bracknell  united kingdom 
as part of the consolidation of our facilities  certain leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures were abandoned 
as a result we recorded a non cash impairment charge equal to the net book value of these abandoned assets in restructuring and lease abandonment charges 
primarily due to the real estate markets in which we operate remaining at depressed levels longer than originally anticipated  we extended the estimated sublease commencement dates and or reduced the estimated sublease rates on certain restructured properties 
we believe that our estimates with respect to our remaining obligations related to fiscal  and restructurings are appropriate as of february  as a result of our restructuring initiatives during the past three fiscal years  we have reduced all other operating expenses as defined on page to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the cost savings associated with our restructuring and cost containment efforts begin to be fully realized in the following quarter 
we do not expect our cost savings to be offset by increases in other expense areas 
details of our restructuring and lease abandonment charges are included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
substantially all of the cost savings from our restructuring initiatives had been reflected in our operating results by the second half of fiscal all other operating expenses were million during the six months ended february  we expect all other operating expenses to be similar during the first half of fiscal the total restructuring and lease abandonment charges reflected in the financial statements are based on management s current estimates  which may change materially if actual lease related expenditures or sublease income differ from current estimates 
non cash stock compensation expense benefit 
we recognized non cash stock compensation expense benefit of million in fiscal  million in fiscal related to unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition of talus and million in fiscal  respectively  related to stock options that were repriced in january and unvested stock options assumed in the talus acquisition 
these amounts are included as a separate component of stockholders equity and are amortized by charges to operations in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
repriced options in january  the company repriced certain employee stock options  other than those held by executive officers or directors 
this resulted in approximately million options being repriced and the four year vesting period starting over 
under fin  repriced options are subject to variable plan accounting  which requires compensation cost or benefit to be recorded each period based on changes in our stock price until the repriced options are exercised  forfeited or expire 
this resulted in a benefit of million in fiscal the initial fair value used to measure the ongoing stock option compensation charge or benefit was based on the closing price of our common stock on june  since our stock price at the beginning and end of fiscal and was below  no charge or benefit was recorded during fiscal and as of february   approximately million repriced options were still outstanding  all of which are fully vested 
in future periods  we will record additional charges or benefits related to the repriced stock options still outstanding based on the change in our common stock price compared to the last reporting period 
if our stock price at the beginning and end of any reporting period is less than  no charge or benefit will be recorded 
unvested stock options talus acquisition as part of the talus acquisition  we assumed all outstanding talus stock options  which were converted into our stock options 
options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were unvested at the acquisition date 
fin requires the acquiring company to measure the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed at the acquisition date in a purchase business combination and record a compensation charge over the remaining vesting period of those options to the extent those options remain outstanding 
this resulted in a charge of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect to record approximately million in fiscal for the remaining compensation charge related to the talus stock options 
iri settlement 
the iri settlement charge of million in fiscal represents the amount in excess of a liability accrued in prior years for the resolution of a dispute between the company and information resources  inc iri 
details of the iri settlement are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
other expense  net other expense  net  includes interest income from cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  interest expense from borrowings  foreign currency exchange gains or losses and other gains or losses 
other expense  net was million in fiscal  compared to million and million in fiscal in fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal relates to a reduction in interest income of million and million exchange loss in fiscal  compared to a million exchange gain in fiscal the decrease in fiscal relates to an impairment loss we recorded of approximately million relating to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our equity investment in converge  inc in fiscal offset by lower interest income as a result of lower average invested cash and marketable securities and lower average interest rates in fiscal debt conversion expense during fiscal  the company exchanged million of its notes for  shares of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions with note holders 
the offer and issuance of the common stock underlying these transactions were exempt from registration under section a of the securities act of and were freely traded upon issuance 
at the conversion price of per share  the million of notes exchanged would have been convertible into  shares of common stock 
for accounting purposes  the additional  shares of common stock that the company issued in these transactions are considered an inducement for the holders to convert their notes  which required the company to record a non operating expense equal to the fair value of the additional shares issued to the holders 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash debt conversion expense of approximately million during the year ended february  these transactions resulted in a million reduction of the notes outstanding and increased stockholders equity by million 
the  shares of common stock issued in these transactions represent approximately of the shares outstanding as of february  provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and a benefit from income tax of million in fiscal in fiscal  million of income tax provision relates to foreign taxes 
during fiscal  management concluded that  based on various factors  including our cumulative losses for fiscal  and when adjusted for non recurring items  the size of our loss for fiscal and estimates of future profitability  future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to cover our net deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of positive and negative evidence regarding recoverability of our deferred tax assets net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  which resulted in a million charge to income tax expense in fiscal management will continue to monitor its estimates of future profitability and realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
we do not expect to record a deferred income tax benefit in future periods when we incur a loss 
loss per common share loss per common share is computed in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  which requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for entities with complex capital structures 
basic earnings loss per common share is based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings or loss per common share include  when dilutive  i the effect of stock options  warrants and restricted stock granted using the treasury stock method  ii the effect of contingently issuable shares earned during the period  and iii shares issuable under the conversion feature of our notes using the if converted method 
future weighted average shares outstanding calculations will be impacted by the following factors the ongoing issuance of common stock associated with stock option and warrant exercises  the issuance of common shares associated with our employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants  any fluctuations in our stock price  which could cause changes in the number of common stock equivalents included in the diluted earnings per common share calculations to the extent we have positive net income  the issuance of common stock to raise capital or effect business combinations should we enter into such transactions  and assumed or actual conversions of our convertible debt into common stock 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements through cash flows provided from operations  long term borrowings including the sale of convertible notes and sales of equity securities 
our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments in aggregate increased million during fiscal to million as of february  working capital increased million to million at february  in fiscal working capital decreased million to million at february  in fiscal the increase in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments resulted from net loss  excluding non cash charges  less changes in working capital items plus change in restricted cash of million  which was provided by the elimination of cash restrictions upon the transfer of our letters of credit from bank of america boa to svb 
approximately million was reclassified to cash and approximately million was recorded as a deposit to secure an international lease see note  million in payments for restructuring obligations  million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases  and million in proceeds from settlement of an acquisition escrow  offset by cash outflows for million in expenditures on property  equipment and software  including capitalized software  million in principal payments on long term debt and capital leases 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal cash used in operations was million in fiscal the improvement in operating cash flows of million in fiscal resulted from a decreased operating loss in fiscal cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
investing activities consist of the sales and purchases of marketable securities and long term investments  changes in restricted cash  purchases of property and equipment  purchases and capitalization of software and acquisitions of businesses

approximately million of this million was recorded as a deposit to secure an international lease 
total purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to fiscal due to the completion of the buildout of our new corporate headquarters space during fiscal acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired  of million and million during the fiscal and relates to approximately million which was provided by proceeds held in escrow from prior acquisitions fiscal and the wds and digital freight exchange  inc dfe acquisitions fiscal  respectively

and an investment in converge  inc cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in all periods consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases  offset in fiscal by payments on capital leases and our svb equipment line of credit 
the company had million and million in notes as of february  and february   respectively 
the notes bear interest at per annum which is payable semi annually 
the fair market value of the notes in the hands of the holders was million and million on february  and february   respectively  based on market quotes 
the notes mature in november and are convertible into approximately million shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
the conversion price of the notes will be adjusted in the event that we issue our common stock as a dividend or distribution with respect to our common stock  we subdivide  combine or reclassify our common stock  we issue rights to our common stockholders to purchase our common stock at less than market price  we make certain distributions of securities  cash or other property to our common stockholders other than ordinary cash dividends  or we make certain repurchases of our common stock 
upon a change of control of the company  the holders of the notes would have the right to require us or our successor to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase in cash 
the notes do not have any financial covenants 
on or after november   we may redeem  from time to time  the notes in whole or in part  at our option 
redemption can be made on at least days notice if the trading price of our common stock for trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the day prior to the mailing of notice of redemption exceeds of the conversion price of the notes 
the redemption price  expressed as a percentage of the principal amount  is redemption period redemption price november  through october  november  through october  november  through october  november  through maturity in the twelve months ended february   the company exchanged million of the notes for  shares of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions with note holders 
the offer and issuance of the common stock underlying these transactions are exempt from registration under section a of the securities act of and were freely traded upon issuance 
at the conversion price of per share  the million of notes exchanged would have been convertible into  shares of common stock 
for accounting purposes  the additional  shares of common stock that the company issued in these transactions are considered an inducement for the holders to convert their notes  which required the company to record a non operating expense equal to the fair value of the additional shares issued to the holders 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash debt conversion expense of approximately million during the twelve months ended february  these transactions resulted in a million reduction of the notes outstanding and increased stockholders equity by million 
the  shares of common stock represent of the shares outstanding as of february  on january   we entered into a one year unsecured revolving credit facility with svb for million 
in march  we renewed the unsecured revolving credit facility with svb for million 
under the terms of this credit facility  we may request cash advances  letters of credit  or both 
the credit facility requires us to comply with the following financial covenants i minimum tangible net worth defined as stockholders equity plus convertible debt less goodwill  capitalized software costs and other intangible assets must be greater than million as of february   million as of may   million as of august  and november  and million as of february   and ii a ratio of a unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments deposited with svb and its affiliates plus net accounts receivable to b current liabilities plus  long term indebtedness to svb and outstanding letters of credit  minus deferred revenue  of at least to in addition  the svb credit facility requires us to maintain million in funds with svb and its affiliates 
the credit facility also restricts the amount of additional debt we can incur and restricts the amount of cash that we can use for acquisitions and for the repurchase of convertible debt 
under the terms of the svb credit facility  we maintain the right to terminate the facility at any time upon repayment of any advances and the posting of cash collateral for any outstanding letters of credit 
under the credit facility  svb has the right to obtain a lien on all of our assets  other than intellectual property  upon an occurrence of default  unless we terminate the facility as provided above 
the credit facility also provides that  upon an event of default  we are prohibited from paying a cash dividend to our shareholders 
as of february   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under this line to secure our lease obligations for office space 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of february  we have an additional credit agreement with svb  as amended  under which the company was able to borrow up to million for the purchase of equipment

in the future  we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in addition  we may make strategic investments in businesses and enter into joint ventures that complement our existing business 
any future acquisition or investment may result in a decrease to our liquidity and working capital to the extent we pay with cash 
we may chose to purchase a portion of the notes in the open market from time to time with cash or enter into alternative transactions to reduce the balance of the notes  such as exchanging notes for shares of our common stock  if we are able to do so on terms favorable to us 
purchases of the notes with cash would reduce our debt outstanding and may result in a decrease to our liquidity and working capital to the extent that we pay cash 
we believe that our existing liquidity and expected cash flows from operations will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe that the combination of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund expected capital expenditures  capital lease obligations and working capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  weakening economic conditions or weak demand for enterprise application software in future periods could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and liquidity 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may elect to obtain additional debt or equity financing if we are able to raise it on terms favorable to us 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
we have entered into operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are oftentimes referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of february  are detailed previously in liquidity and capital resources 
we have a one year unsecured revolving credit facility with svb for million which will expire on march   unless renewed 
under the terms of this credit facility  we may request cash advances  letters of credit  or both 
as of february   million in letters of credit were outstanding under this line to secure our lease obligations for certain office space 
we license software to our customers under written agreements we refer to as software license agreements sla 
each sla contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer  and generally includes certain provisions for indemnifying the customer against losses  expenses and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event that our software is found to infringe upon a patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary right of a third party 
the sla generally limits the scope and remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects  including but not limited to certain time and geography based scope limitations and a right to replace an infringing product or modify the product so that it is no longer infringing 
if we cannot address the infringement by replacing the products or services  or modifying the products or services  we are allowed to cancel the software license and return the fees paid by customer 
we require our employees to sign a proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement  which assigns the rights in our employees development work to us 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and no material claims are outstanding as of february  for several reasons  including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the slas  we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments  if any  related to such indemnification provisions 
there can be no assurance that potential future payment will not have a material adverse effect on our operating performance or financial condition 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin that addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin provides guidance for determining when a primary beneficiary should consolidate a variable interest entity  or equivalent structure that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation is effective after january  for newly created variable interest entities 
for variable interest entities created before february   the interpretation is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  we believe the effect of adopting this statement will not have a material impact on our operating performance and financial position 
on may   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas 
sfas establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments  including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with share repurchase programs 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and to other instruments as of september  the effect of adopting this statement did not have a material impact on our operating performance and financial position 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business  operating performance and financial condition 
risks related to our indebtedness and financial condition our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in november  we completed a convertible debt offering of million in notes that are due november during fiscal  the balance of the notes was reduced to million as a result of million of notes being exchanged for shares of our common stock 
our indebtedness could have important consequences for investors 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of capital to fund our operations  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors 
although we have no present plans to do so  we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
while the terms of our credit facility impose certain limits on our ability to incur additional debt  we are permitted to incur additional debt subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the credit facility 
the terms of the notes set forth no limits on our ability to incur additional debt 
if a significant amount of new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
we may have insufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers 
we will be required to generate cash sufficient to pay all amounts due on the notes and to conduct our business operations 
the notes require interest payments of million annually with million of principal due november as of february   the remaining principal and interest payments due under the notes were million 
our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments totaled million as of february  assuming our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments remain constant from our february  levels  we will have to generate a minimum of million of net cash flow through any combination of normal operations of the company  raising of debt and equity capital or asset sales by november to meet our remaining principal and interest payments under the notes 
we have incurred net losses in the past  and we may not be able to cover our anticipated debt service obligations 
this may materially hinder our ability to make principal and interest payments on the notes 
concerns about our ability to meet our debt service obligations could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers 
our ability to meet our future debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we may choose to exchange the notes for shares of our common stock in the open market or purchase a portion of the notes for cash which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or could materially dilute existing stockholders 
we have issued  shares of our common stock in exchange for the notes in privately negotiated transactions under section a of the securities act of  and we expect to enter into such transactions from time to time if we are able to do so on terms that are favorable to us 
if we choose to enter into privately negotiated transactions to exchange some of our outstanding notes for shares of our common stock  it could materially dilute the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders and result in a non cash charge to earnings 
in addition  to the extent we are able to do so on terms favorable to us  we may choose to purchase a portion of the notes outstanding from time to time in the open market with cash 
while the terms of our credit facility impose certain limits on our ability to repurchase our debt securities with cash  we are permitted to do so subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the credit facility 
if purchases of the notes in the open market were funded from available cash and cash equivalents  it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
we may violate financial covenants under our credit facility which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
during fiscal  our financial performance made it difficult for us to achieve the financial covenants under our credit facility with boa 
during november  we were required to cash collateralize million of outstanding letters of credit under the boa credit facility as a result of violating a financial covenant 
also  we violated the consolidated ebitda covenant under the boa credit facility for the quarter ended november  in january  we entered into a new unsecured million credit facility with svb to replace the boa credit facility 
we renewed the unsecured credit facility with svb on march  with borrowing capacity reduced to million 
we also have an additional credit agreement with svb  under which the company is able to borrow up to million for the purchase of equipment 
as of february   approximately million of letters of credit were outstanding with svb  and approximately million was outstanding under the equipment financing credit line with svb 
if our future financial performance results in a violation of financial covenants under the new credit facility with svb  or with our equipment financing credit line with svb  we could be required to provide cash collateral for letters of credit or repay outstanding borrowings  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
risks related to our business adverse economic and political conditions caused a deterioration of demand in the markets for our products and services in recent years and have adversely affected and could further adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition 
our revenue and operating results depend on the overall demand for our software and related services 
regional and global adverse changes in the economy and political upheaval and unrest caused a deterioration of the markets for our products and services in recent years 
this resulted in reductions  delays and postponements of customer purchases  which materially adversely affected our financial performance during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal demand for our solutions designed to optimize pricing and revenue management  a component of our demand management solutions  was more severely affected than our other solutions for which there are more mature markets 
although our markets deteriorated in most industries and geographies  industries most severely impacted include  among others  chemical energy  high technology  and travel  transportation hospitality 
industries less affected include communications  consumer packaged goods  government  life sciences  retail and aerospace defense 
if these adverse conditions continue or worsen  we would likely experience further reductions  delays  and postponements of customer purchases further adversely affecting our operating performance and financial condition 
national and global responses to future hostilities and terrorist attacks may materially adversely affect demand for our software and services because of the economic and political effects on our markets and by interrupting the ability of our customers to do business in the ordinary course  as a result of a variety of factors  including  among others  changes or disruptions in movement and sourcing of materials  goods and components or possible interruptions in the flow of information or monies 
we experienced significant losses in recent years due to a deterioration of demand in our markets resulting from weakening economic conditions and increased political instability commencing in fiscal we recently incurred significant losses 
beginning in fiscal  weakening economic conditions and increased political instability resulted in a deterioration in our markets 
we experienced sequential declines in software and total revenue during our second and third quarters of fiscal further weakening of economic conditions  which severely impacted the timing of capital spending decisions for computer software  particularly enterprise application software  further negatively impacted the markets for our products and services 
this again resulted in sequential quarterly declines in software and total revenue in our first three quarters of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal the losses incurred during these periods were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our ability to improve our financial performance will depend on a stabilization or improvement of economic conditions resulting in increased demand for our software and our continued ability to align our cost structure with revenue without retarding our ability to grow revenue in future periods 
if market conditions for our software do not improve or if we do not successfully continue to align our cost structure with our revenue without retarding our ability to grow revenue  our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed  and we could continue to incur significant losses 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of severe declines in our stock price over fiscal if our stock price decreases to levels such that the implied fair value of the company is significantly less than stockholders equity for a sustained period of time  we may be required to record additional significant non cash charges associated with goodwill impairment 
on march   we adopted sfas  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only method 
effective march   we stopped amortizing goodwill  but continued amortizing other intangible assets with finite lives 
as required by the provisions of sfas  we performed the initial goodwill impairment test required during our first quarter of fiscal we consider ourselves to have a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with our entire company 
as of march   based upon our implied fair value  there was no impairment of goodwill recorded upon implementation of sfas during the quarters ended august   november  and february   we experienced adverse changes in our stock price resulting from a decline in our financial performance caused by adverse business conditions that have affected the technology industry  especially enterprise application software companies 
based on these factors  we performed a test for goodwill impairment at august   november  and february  and determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  our market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of the company as of august  and november   there was no impairment of goodwill  but as of february   there was an impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the impairment of goodwill as of february   we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value 
if our stock price is significantly lower than recent levels such that the implied fair value of the company is significantly less than stockholders equity for a sustained period of time  among other factors  we may be required to record an additional impairment loss related to goodwill below its carrying amount 
we performed a test for goodwill impairment at february   which is our annual date for goodwill impairment review  and determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  our market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of the company as of february  there was no impairment of goodwill 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the implied fair value of the company below its carrying value 
our future results will be adversely affected by several types of significant non cash charges which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we will incur significant non cash charges in the future related to the amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets from past acquisitions 
during fiscal  we announced that we were required to write off our investment in converge  inc  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
during fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets which resulted in a million non cash charge to income tax expense 
also during fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
during fiscal  and  we recorded write downs of long lived assets associated with restructuring and lease abandonments of approximately million  million and million  respectively  consisting of the abandonment of certain furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and leasehold improvements related to permanently vacating office space 
during fiscal  we exchanged million of the notes for million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions  which resulted in a non cash debt conversion expense of million 
we may also incur non cash charges in future periods related to impairments of long lived assets and future exchanges of notes for shares of our common stock  if any 
to achieve profitability  we must grow our revenue sufficiently to cover these charges 
our failure to achieve profitability could cause our stock price to decline 
if our restructuring plans and our cost containment and cost reduction measures fail to achieve the desired results or result in unanticipated negative consequences  we may suffer material harm to our operating performance and financial condition 
because of the downturn in our markets as a result of progressive weakening of global economic conditions and increased political instability during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we faced significant challenges in our ability to stabilize revenue  improve operating performance and expand market share 
in response to the impact on our financial performance  we implemented restructuring plans and cost containment and cost reduction measures and are continuing to implement cost containment and cost reduction measures to align our cost structure with our revenues 
these actions have included  among other things  workforce reductions and mandatory unpaid leave programs 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods 
if we fail to achieve the desired results of our restructuring plans and our cost containment and cost reduction measures  we may suffer material harm to our operating performance and financial condition 
we reduced our workforce as part of our recent cost containment and cost reduction initiatives 
if we fail to field and retain a qualified workforce  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to motivate and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  marketing and services personnel 
competition for skilled personnel can be intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  motivating and retaining the personnel required to improve our financial performance and grow 
during the second half of fiscal  voluntary employee attrition has increased compared to recent periods 
in addition  the cost of hiring  training and retaining skilled employees is high 
failure to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
our recent cost containment and cost reduction initiatives may yield unintended consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce  reduced employee morale and decreased productivity 
in addition  the recent trading levels of our stock have decreased the value of our stock options granted to employees under our stock option plans 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek alternate employment  such as with larger  more established companies or companies that they perceive as having less volatile stock prices or better prospects 
continuity of personnel is a very important factor in sales and implementation of our software and our product development efforts 
attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we have experienced significant turnover in senior management recently 
the success and growth of our business may suffer if we lose additional key personnel 
our success depends significantly on the continued service of our executive officers 
we do not have fixed term employment agreements with any executive officers  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on our executive officers 
seven of our executive officers left the company between may and march the loss of services of any of our executive officers for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we reduced our sales force as part of our recent cost containment and cost reduction initiatives 
if we fail to field an effective sales organization  our ability to grow will be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we have reduced our sales force in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal as a result of the deterioration in our markets 
decreasing software revenue and unpaid leave programs have resulted in reduced compensation earned by members of our sales force  which may result in further voluntary attrition of our sales force over time 
in order to grow our revenue  we will have to field a more productive sales force 
recently  we replaced a number of our sales account managers and sales management and began to expand our sales force as the markets for our products and solutions appear to be improving modestly 
our past efforts to expand our sales organization have required significant resources 
new sales personnel require training and take time to achieve full productivity 
there is no assurance that we will be able to field a more productive sales force or successfully attract and retain qualified sales people at levels sufficient to support growth 
any failure to adequately sell our products could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we periodically have restructured our sales force  which can be disruptive 
we continue to rely heavily on our direct sales force 
in recent years  we have restructured or made other adjustments to our sales force in response to factors such as management changes  product changes  geographical coverage and other internal considerations 
change in the structures of the sales force and sales force management can result in temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity that may affect revenues in one or more quarters 
we cannot assure you that we will not continue to restructure our sales force or that the transition issues associated with restructuring the sales force will not recur 
sales cycles for our products and services can be long and unpredictable 
variations in the time it takes us to license our software may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
the time it takes to license our software to prospective clients varies substantially  but historically has ranged between three and twelve months 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenue to fluctuate widely from period to period 
because we typically recognize a substantial portion of our software revenue in the last month of a quarter  any delay in the licensing of our products could cause significant variations in our revenue from quarter to quarter 
these delays have occurred on a number of occasions in the past and materially adversely affected our financial performance 
furthermore  these fluctuations could cause our operating results to suffer in some future periods because our operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short term  and we devote significant time and resources to prospective clients 
the length of our sales cycle depends on a number of factors  including the following the complexities of client challenges our solutions address  the breadth of the solution required by the client  including the technical  organizational and geographic scope of the license  the size  timing and complexity of contractual terms of licenses and sales of our products and services  wide variations in contractual terms  which may result in deferred recognition of revenue  customer financial constraints and credit worthiness  the evaluation and approval processes employed by the clients and prospects  which has become more complex and lengthy  economic  political and market conditions  and any other delays arising from factors beyond our control 
failure to maintain our service rates for implementation services could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from implementation services 
implementation services are predominately billed on an hourly or daily basis time and materials and sometimes under fixed price contracts 
implementation services billed on an hourly or daily basis are generally recognized as work is performed 
if we are not able to maintain the current service rates for our time and materials implementation services  without corresponding cost reductions  or if the percentage of fixed price contracts increases  and we underestimate the costs of our fixed price contracts  our operating performance may suffer 
the rates we charge for our implementation services depend on a number of factors  including the following our clients and prospects perceptions of our ability to add value through our implementation services  complexity of services performed  competition  pricing policies of our competitors and systems integrators  the use of globally sourced  lower cost service delivery capabilities within our industry  and general economic conditions 
changes in the size of our software transactions may cause material fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
the size of our software license transactions fluctuates 
fluctuations in the size of our software transactions have occurred  and may in the future occur  as a result of changes in demand for our software and services 
losses of  or delays in concluding  larger software transactions which typically are more complex  take longer to negotiate and are more subject to delays have had and could have a proportionately greater effect on our revenue and financial performance for a particular period 
for example  we recorded software transactions of million or greater in fiscal  software transactions of million or greater in fiscal and software transactions of million or greater in fiscal as a result of these changes in the size of our software transactions  our quarterly revenue and financial performance have fluctuated significantly and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
we experienced declines in software revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal a reduction in our revenue derived from software licenses resulted and may in the future result in reduced services and support revenue 
our ability to maintain or increase services and support revenue depends on our ability to maintain or increase the amount of software we license to customers 
during our fiscal and  we experienced declines in services revenue primarily as a result of declining software revenue in prior periods 
additional decreases of software license revenue or slowdowns in licensing may have a material adverse effect on our services and support revenues in future periods 
in our third quarter of fiscal  our first two quarters of fiscal and fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced sequential quarterly declines in support revenue resulting from both the recent decline in software revenue and clients not renewing or partially renewing existing support contracts 
further declines in software revenue  a reduction in the renewal rate of annual support contracts  or both  could result in a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
our support revenue includes post contract support and the rights to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements 
support contracts are generally renewable annually at the option of our customers 
we have experienced high rates of renewed annual support contracts from our customers 
if our software revenue does not grow and if our customers fail to renew or to fully renew their support contracts at historical rates  our support revenue could materially decline 
we have a history of supplementing our existing revenue generation capabilities through acquisitions of businesses and technology 
acquisitions increase business and financial risk 
we have experienced difficulties integrating acquisitions in the past 
an acquisition involves the integration of business that has previously operated independently and increases the business and financial risk of the acquirer 
in fiscal  and we acquired the products and operations of talus  stg holdings  inc  onerelease  csd  spaceworks  wds and dfe 
in connection with these and any future acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will effectively integrate employees  operations  products and systems  realize the expected benefits of the transaction  retain key employees  effectively develop and protect key technologies and proprietary know how  avoid conflicts with our clients and business partners that have commercial relationships or compete with the acquired company  avoid unanticipated operational difficulties or expenditures or both  and effectively operate our existing business lines  given the significant diversion of resources and management attention required to successfully integrate acquisitions 
although we are not currently contemplating any acquisitions  future acquisitions may result in a dilution to existing shareholders to the extent we issue shares of our common stock as consideration or reduced liquidity and capital resources to the extent we use cash as consideration 
if the markets for our products do not grow or suffer further declines  our operating performance and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
substantially all of our software  services and support revenue have arisen from  or are related directly to  our solutions 
we expect to be dependent upon these solutions in the future  and any factor adversely affecting the markets for our solutions would materially and adversely affect our ability to grow revenue and operating profitability 
the markets for our solutions have been and may continue to be materially adversely affected if economic and political conditions deteriorate 
while we believe the markets for our solutions will expand as the economy improves  they may grow more slowly than in the past or anticipated 
if the markets for our solutions decline or do not grow as rapidly as we expect  revenue growth  operating margins  or both  could be adversely affected 
our markets are very competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets for our solutions are very competitive 
the intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased in part as a result of the deterioration in our markets 
we expect this intensity of competition to increase in the future 
our current and potential competitors may make acquisitions of other competitors and may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
if there is significant consolidation among enterprise application software companies  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
some competitors are offering software that competes with ours at little or no charge as components of bundled products or on a stand alone basis 
smaller niche software companies have been and will likely continue to develop unique offerings that compete effectively with some of our solutions 
further  our current or prospective clients and partners may become competitors in the future 
increased competition has resulted and in the future could result in price reductions  lower gross margins  longer sales cycles and the loss of market share 
each of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and therefore  we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them 
we directly compete with other enterprise application software vendors including adexa  aspen technology  demandtec  the descartes systems group  global logistics technologies  i technologies  jda software  khimetrics  logility  manhattan associates  mercia  metreo  pros revenue management  rapt  retek  sabre  sap  viewlocity and zilliant 
certain enterprise resource planning erp vendors  in addition to sap  all of which are substantially larger than manugistics  have acquired or developed demand and supply chain management software companies  products  or functionality or have announced intentions to develop and sell demand and supply chain management solutions 
such vendors include oracle  peoplesoft and ssa global technologies 
some of our current and potential competitors  particularly the erp vendors  have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of clients 
some of our current and potential competitors  particularly  but not limited to  oracle and peoplesoft  may combine pursuant to recently announced tender offers and subsequently utilize enhanced financial and human resources to develop and sell more competitive demand chain and supply chain products 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential clients and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
if the development of our products and services fails to keep pace with our industry s rapidly evolving technology  our future results may be materially and adversely affected 
the markets for our solutions are subject to rapid technological change  changing client needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
we have historically been successful in keeping pace with these changes  but if we fail to do so in the future  our products and services may be rendered less competitive or obsolete 
our product development and testing efforts have required  and are expected to continue to require  substantial investments 
we have released a web native version of many of our products and will continue to develop and release web native versions of our products 
we may not possess sufficient resources in the future to continue to make further necessary investments in technology 
recent cutbacks in our workforce could lengthen the time necessary to develop our products 
in addition  we may not successfully identify new software opportunities or develop and bring new software to market in a timely and efficient manner 
our growth and future operating results will depend  in part  upon our ability to continue to enhance existing applications and develop and introduce new applications or capabilities that meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace  meet changing market and client requirements  including rapid realization of benefits and the need to rapidly manage and analyze increasingly large volumes of data  comply with changing industry standards  achieve market acceptance  integrate third party software effectively  and respond to competitive offerings 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced software in a timely manner  we may lose existing clients and fail to attract new clients  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
our continued shift of a significant number of our contractors to india poses significant risks 
we have relationships with third parties in india to outsource a significant portion of our product development effort 
we have continued to increase the proportion of our product development work being performed by contractors to india in order to take advantage of cost efficiencies associated with india s lower wage scale 
however  we may not achieve the cost savings and other benefits we anticipate from this program  and we may not be able to find sufficient numbers of developers with the necessary skill sets in india to meet our needs 
we have a heightened risk exposure to changes in the economic  security and political conditions of india 
economic and political instability  military actions and other unforeseen occurrences in india could impair our ability to develop and introduce new software applications and functionality in a timely manner  which could put our products at a competitive disadvantage whereby we lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers 
defects in our software or problems in the implementation of our software could lead to claims for damages by our clients  loss of revenue or delays in the market acceptance of our solutions 
our software is complex 
this complexity can make it difficult to detect errors in our software prior to implementation 
we may not discover errors in our software until our customers install and use a given product or until the volume of services that a product provides increases 
when our software is installed  the environment into which it is installed is frequently complex and typically contains a wide variety of systems and third party software  with which our software must be integrated 
this can make the process of implementation difficult and lengthy 
as a result  some customers may have difficulty implementing our products successfully within anticipated timeframes or otherwise achieve the expected benefits 
these problems may result in claims for damages suffered by our clients  a loss of  or delays in  the market acceptance of our solutions  client dissatisfaction and lost revenue and collection difficulties during the period required to correct these errors 
we utilize third party software that we incorporate into and include with our products and solutions  and impaired relations with these third parties  defects in third party software or their inability or failure to enhance their software over time could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we incorporate and include third party software into and with our products and solutions 
we are likely to incorporate and include additional third party software into and with our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings 
if our relations with any of these third party software providers are impaired  and if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software  our business could be harmed 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we utilize 
it may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third party software because the software is not within our control 
accordingly  our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software 
we utilize third parties to integrate our software with other software products and platforms 
if any of these third parties should cease to provide integration services to us  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on companies such as business objects  inovus  tibco software  vignette  and webmethods to integrate our software with software and platforms developed by third parties 
if relations with any of these third parties are impaired  and if we are unable to secure a replacement on a timely basis  our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed 
if these companies are unable to develop or maintain software that effectively integrates with our software and is free from defects  our ability to license our products and provide solutions could be impaired and our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance their software s capabilities 
our efforts to develop and sustain relationships with vendors such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others to market and implement our software products may fail  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we are developing  maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors  such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions 
we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
we may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively 
our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause 
many of the organizations with which we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors 
there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us and our products 
the loss of relationships with important organizations could materially and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition 
as a result of the wds acquisition  an increased percentage of our revenue will be derived from contracts with the government 
government contracts are subject to cost and other audits by the government and terminations for the convenience of the government 
government procurement is highly regulated  and contractors are subject to the risks of protests  claims  penalties  fines  default termination  and rescission  among other actions 
the adverse result of a government audit or action against any of our contracts with the government could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
government contracts face special risks due to potential audits by government agencies 
the wds acquisition has significantly increased the percentage of our revenue derived from contracts with the federal government 
government contractors are commonly subject to various audits and investigations by government agencies 
one agency that oversees or enforces contract performance is the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the dcaa generally performs a review of a contractor s performance on its contracts  its pricing practices  costs and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards and to verify that costs have been properly charged to the government 
although the dcaa has completed an initial review of our accounting practices and procedures allowing us to invoice the government  it has yet to exercise its option to perform an audit of our actual invoicing of government contracts 
these audits may occur several years after completion of the audited work 
if an audit were to identify significant unallowable costs  we could have a material charge to our earnings or reduction to our cash position as a result of the audit and this could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with us federal government agencies 
in addition  we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us  whether or not true 
government contracts are subject to unique risks of early termination 
in addition  government contracts may be subject to termination by the government for its convenience  as well as termination  reduction or modification in the event of budgetary constraints or any change in the government s requirements 
if any of our time and materials or fixed priced contracts were to be terminated for the government s convenience  we would probably receive only the purchase price for items delivered prior to termination  reimbursement for allowable costs for work in progress and an allowance for profit on the contract  or an adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss 
government contracts are also conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations 
congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis  even though the contract performance may extend over many years 
consequently  at the outset of a program  the contract is usually only partially funded  and congress must annually determine if additional funds will be appropriated to the program 
as a result  long term contracts are subject to cancellation if appropriations for future periods become unavailable 
we have not historically experienced any significant material adverse effects as a result of the government s failure to fund programs awarded to us 
if the government were to terminate some or all of our contracts or reduce appropriations  cancel appropriations or both to a program we have a contract under  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
competitive bidding  a cornerstone to government contracting  imposes risks and costs 
we derive significant revenue from federal contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process  which can impose substantial costs upon us  and we will lose revenue if we or our contracting partners typically  prime contractors with whom we subcontract fail to compete effectively 
competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks  including the need to bid before design is complete  bid and proposal costs  risks in estimation of prospective needs  and bid protests that may delay or derail awards 
our work with other contractors poses risks  including risks to our reputation 
as a prime contractor  we may rely upon other companies as subcontractors to perform work we are obligated to deliver to our clients 
a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to perform the agreed upon services on a timely and satisfactory basis may compromise our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor 
in some cases  we have limited involvement in the work performed by the subcontractor and may have exposure as a result of problems caused by the subcontractor 
in extreme cases  performance deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a government client terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability for the agency s costs of reprocurement  damage our reputation  and hurt our ability to compete for future contracts 
additionally  we may have disputes with our subcontractors that could impair our ability to execute our contracts as required 
despite careful precautions that we take  we are exposed to risk due to potential employee misconduct in the highly regulated government marketplace 
we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with federal government procurement regulations  engaging in unauthorized activities  or falsifying time records 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses  which could harm our business 
the government marketplace has a unique risk that appropriations to fund contracts will not be made  or will be diverted or delayed 
a decline in overall us government expenditures could cause a decrease in our revenue and adversely affect our operating performance 
defense spending levels may not continue at present levels  and future levels of expenditures and authorizations for existing programs may decline  remain constant  or shift to agencies or programs in areas where we do not currently have contracts 
a significant decline in defense expenditures  or a shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support  could cause a material decline in our government related revenue 
federal contracts are subject to unique terms and risks  not commonly found in the commercial marketplace 
federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government clients with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
these rights and remedies allow government clients  among other things  to as noted  terminate existing contracts for convenience  as well as default  reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts  often unilaterally  terminate security clearances and thereby prevent classified contracting  cancel multi year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent years become unavailable  decline to exercise options to renew multi year contracts  claim rights in certain products  systems  and technology produced by us  prohibit future awards based on a finding of an organizational conflict of interest  subject contract awards to protest  and  as noted  suspend or debar contractors 
our federal contracts pose unique pricing risks 
much of our federal contracting is done through a type of special contract  sponsored by the us general services administration gsa  known as the multiple award schedules or simply schedules contract 
our gsa schedules contract  like all others  includes a clause known as the price reductions clause  the terms of that clause are analogous to a most favored customer clause in commercial contracts 
under that clause  we have agreed that the prices to the government under the gsa schedules contract will maintain a constant relationship to the prices charged to certain commercial customers  ie  when prices to those benchmark customers drop  so too must our prices on our gsa schedules contract 
although we have undertaken extensive efforts to comply with the price reductions clause  it is possible that we  through  for example  an unreported discount offered to a benchmark customer  might fail to honor the obligations of the price reductions clause 
if that occurred  we could  under certain circumstances  be subject to an audit  an action in fraud  or other adverse government actions or penalties 
the limited ability of legal protections to safeguard our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to compete effectively 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality procedures and agreements  contractual provisions  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  particularly in certain foreign countries  including  among others  the people s republic of china 
we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
our products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
the number of intellectual property claims in our industry may increase as the number of competing products grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
in recent years  there has been a tendency by software companies to file substantially increasing numbers of patent applications  including those for business methods and processes 
we have no way of knowing what patent applications third parties have filed until the application is published or until a patent is issued 
patent applications are often published within months of filing  but it can take as long as three years or more for a patent to be granted after an application has been filed 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to address  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 
our international operations pose risks for our business and financial condition 
we currently conduct operations in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  france  germany  hong kong  japan  malaysia  mexico  philippines  taiwan  the people s republic of china  singapore  sweden and the united kingdom 
we also have relationships with third parties in india to outsource a portion of our product development and implementation services effort 
we intend to expand our international operations and to increase the proportion of our revenue from outside the us these operations require significant management attention and financial resources and additionally subject us to risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities  failure to properly comply with us laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and services  difficulties in managing foreign operations and appropriate levels of staffing  foreign currency exposure  longer collection cycles  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities  particularly throughout europe  proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences  anti american sentiment due to the war with iraq and other american policies that may be unpopular in certain countries  and increasing political instability  adverse economic conditions and the potential for war or other hostilities in many of these countries 
our failure to properly comply or address any of the above factors could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
changes in the value of the us dollar  in relation to the currencies of foreign countries where we transact business  could harm our operating performance and financial condition 
in fiscal  of our total revenue was derived from outside the united states 
our primary international operations are located throughout europe and asia pacific 
we also have operations in brazil  canada and mexico 
our international revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  typically the local currency of the selling business unit 
therefore  changes in the value of the us dollar as compared to these other currencies may adversely affect our operating results 
we intend to expand our international operations and to increase the proportion of our revenue from outside the us for example  we recently opened offices in malaysia  the philippines and the people s republic of china 
we expect to use an increasing number of foreign currencies  causing our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations to increase 
we generally do not implement hedging programs to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting international accounts receivable  cash balances and intercompany accounts  and we do not hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting future international revenues and expenses and other commitments 
for the foregoing reasons  currency exchange rate fluctuations have caused  and likely will continue to cause  variability in our foreign currency denominated revenue streams and costs and our cost to settle foreign currency denominated liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we may be subject to future liability claims  and the reputations of our company and products may suffer 
many of our implementations involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and provide benefits  some of which may be difficult to quantify 
any failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into agreements with software vendors  consulting firms  resellers and others whereby they market and implement our solutions 
if these vendors fail to meet their clients expectations or cause failures in their clients systems  our reputation and that of our products could be materially and adversely affected even if our software products perform in accordance with their functional specifications 
if requirements relating to accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  we may choose to change our compensation practices 
if we issue additional restricted stock to our employees in future periods  we will be required to record additional compensation expense 
we currently account for the issuance of stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the fasb recently issued a proposed statement of financial standards that  if enacted in its current form  would require compensation expense to be recorded for stock options granted to employees and directors in future periods 
as a result  we could decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees 
this could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation or benefits we would have to pay to them 
in addition  such a change could have a material effect on our operating performance 
in june  our board of directors approved an amendment to our stock option plan to issue restricted shares of manugistics common stock to our employees 
this amendment was approved by stockholders at our annual meeting on july  on october   we issued  shares of restricted stock to certain key employees 
the restricted stock awards granted to key employees vest over four years 
the fair value of the restricted stock awards granted of approximately million was recorded as a component of deferred compensation 
accordingly  we are required to record compensation expense over the life of the vesting period of the restricted stock 
we will be required to record additional compensation expense to the extent that we issue restricted stock to our employees in future periods 
such a change could have a material effect on our operating performance 
it may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain insurance 
we obtain insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities 
in the current market  insurance coverage has become more restrictive  and when insurance coverage is offered  the deductible for which we are responsible is larger and premiums have increased substantially 
as a result  it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels  or if such coverage is available  the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially 
this may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance  which could have a material effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
significant declines in our stock price may result for various reasons  including poor financial performance 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
our stock price has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly revenue and operating results and continuing losses  continued or deteriorating adverse economic  political and market conditions  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts  changes in the performance  market valuations  or both  of our current and potential competitors and the software industry in general  our announcement or a competitor s announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion of our technology in  or compatibility of our technology with  such standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity about us  or our products  services or implementations  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding our competitors  including their products and implementations  additions or departures of key personnel  sales or anticipated sales of additional debt or equity securities  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  the nasdaq national market and the equity markets for software companies in particular  have experienced extraordinary price and volume volatility in recent years 
such volatility has adversely affected the stock prices for many companies irrespective of  or disproportionately to  the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely further affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
scheduled sales of significant amounts of our common stock by our executive officers may cause our stock price to decline 
certain of our executive officers  including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have entered into pre established trading plans to facilitate the orderly sale by them of shares of our common stock 
our executive officers who entered into pre established trading plans are scheduled to sell shares subject to the terms of their respective trading plan 
these terms include one or more price floors below which shares may not be sold 
the minimum price floor for our chief executive officer is per share with respect to a total of  shares that may be sold under the plan and per share with respect to the balance of the shares that may be sold under the plan 
the minimum price floor for our chief financial officer is per share with respect to a total of  shares that may be sold under the plan and per share with respect to the balance of the shares that may be sold under the plan 
sales under each of these pre established trading plans will  subject to the respective terms of the trading plan  continue until the trading plan is modified  terminated or expires 
the sale of these shares  if significant in amount  may cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our charter and bylaws  delaware law and the indenture for the notes contain provisions that could discourage a takeover even if beneficial to stockholders 
our charter and our bylaws  in conjunction with delaware law  contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us even if doing so would be beneficial to stockholders 
for example  our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors and allow our board of directors to expand its size and fill any vacancies without stockholder approval 
furthermore  our board has the authority to issue preferred stock and to designate the voting rights  dividend rate and privileges of the preferred stock  all of which may be greater than the rights of common stockholders 
additionally  upon a change of control of the company  the holders of the notes would have the right to require us or our successor to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase in cash 
this could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us even if doing so would be beneficial to stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risk 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries which use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
such changes could result in cumulative translation gains or losses that are included in shareholders equity 
revenue outside of the united states was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue outside the united states is derived from operations in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  the people s republic of china  france  germany  hong kong  japan  malaysia  mexico  netherlands  philippines  singapore  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies of these countries result in positive or negative fluctuations in the amounts relating to foreign operations reported in our consolidated financial statements 
none of the components of our financial statements were materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal  and we generally do not use foreign currency options and forward contracts to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
while we do not expect to incur material losses as a result of this currency risk  there can be no assurance that losses will not result 
interest rate risk 
our long term investments  marketable securities and certain cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and  accordingly  if market interest rates increase  these investments will decline in value 
we manage this risk by maintaining an overall investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
all securities in our long term investment portfolio mature in two years or less 
instruments in our entire portfolio include  but are not limited to  commercial paper  money market instruments  bank time deposits and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national  state and local governments and agencies  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair market value of our long term investments and marketable securities held was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
we also hold cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the united states and foreign countries 
these cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short term deposits of the local bank 
generally  operating cash balances held at banks outside of the united states are denominated in the local currency 
the united states federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest 
the federal funds rate was as of march  during fiscal and fiscal  the federal funds rate was further reduced by basis points to its february  level of 
these actions have led to a general market decline in interest rates 
the weighted average yield on interest bearing investments held as of february or  and was approximately and  respectively 
based on our investment holdings at february   a basis point decline in the average yield would reduce our annual interest income by million 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments to investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support clients receivables since most of our customers are large  well established companies 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified both by geography and industry and no single customer accounts for more than our consolidated revenue 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
