item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ppl is an energy and utility holding company with headquarters in allentown  pa 
see item  business background  for descriptions of ppl s major segments 
see exhibit in item for the current corporate organization structure 
through its subsidiaries  ppl is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets the northeastern and western us and in the delivery of electricity in pennsylvania  the uk and latin america 
ppl s strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with load  or customer demand  under long term and intermediate term contracts with creditworthy counterparties 
ppl s strategy for its electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these businesses at the highest level of quality and reliability and at the most efficient cost 
ppl faces several risks in its generation business 
the principal risks are electricity wholesale price risk  fuel supply and price risk  power plant performance and counterparty credit risk 
ppl attempts to manage these risks through various means 
for instance  ppl operates a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to geography  fuel source  cost structure and operating characteristics 
ppl is focused on the operating efficiency and maintaining availability of these power plants 
in addition  ppl has in place and continues to pursue long term and intermediate term contracts for energy sales and fuel supply  and other means  to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes in the difference  or margin  between the cost to produce electricity and the price at which ppl sells it 
ppl s contractual commitments for energy sales are primarily satisfied through its own generation assets ie  ppl primarily markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets through integrated generation  marketing and trading functions 
finally  ppl attempts to reduce its exposure to the various risks it faces through its risk management program  which  among other things  includes an evaluation of market risks and the creditworthiness of all counterparties 
ppl s electricity delivery businesses are rate regulated 
accordingly  these businesses are subject to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that they may recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer rates 
the principal challenge that ppl faces in its electricity delivery businesses is to maintain high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost effective manner 
ppl seeks to apply its experience in operating and managing its pennsylvania delivery business to its international businesses 
in turn  ppl has also gained valuable experience by operating and managing these international businesses 
ppl faces certain financial risks by conducting international operations  such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
ppl attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management program 
a key challenge for ppl s business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile 
in the past few years  investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry have been particularly focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of energy companies 
ppl is focused on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is to provide information concerning ppl s past and expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the risks and challenges outlined above 
specifically results of operations provides an overview of ppl s operating results in  and  starting with a review of earnings 
the earnings review includes a listing of certain unusual items that had significant impacts in these years  and it also includes a description of key factors that management expects may impact future earnings 
results of operations also includes an explanation of changes during this three year period in significant income statement components  such as energy margins  utility revenues  operation and maintenance expenses  financing costs  income taxes and cumulative effects of accounting changes 
financial condition liquidity provides an analysis of ppl s liquidity position and credit profile  including its sources of cash including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow and uses of cash including contractual commitments and capital expenditure requirements and the key risks and uncertainties that impact ppl s past and future liquidity position and financial condition 
this subsection also includes an explanation of recent rating agency decisions affecting ppl  as well as a listing of ppl s current credit ratings 
financial condition risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other includes an explanation of ppl s risk management program relating to market risk ie  commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk ie  counterparty credit risk 
new accounting standards provides a description of accounting standards that impact ppl s financial statements and that were implemented in or are pending adoption 
application of critical accounting policies provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl and that require ppl s management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments 
although ppl s management believes that these estimates  assumptions and other judgments are appropriate  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  changes in the estimates  assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on ppl s results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in ppl s financial statements 
the information provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with ppl s financial statements and the notes thereto

the higher volumes were primarily driven by market opportunities to optimize the value of generating assets and by higher spot prices that allowed ppl to increase the utilization of its higher cost generating units including mw of new generation that began commercial operation in mid in pjm  where the majority of ppl s eastern wholesale activity occurs  average on peak spot market real time prices rose in compared to partially offsetting the increase in wholesale energy margins in compared to  was the buyout of a nug contract in february  which reduced power purchases by million 
eastern wholesale margins were lower in compared to  despite a buyout of a nug contract in february that reduced purchased power costs by million 
the decline in margins was primarily attributable to the decline in wholesale prices for energy and capacity 
pjm on peak prices averaged mwh less  a decline of  for compared to additionally  because new generating capability came on line within pjm in  the prices for the pjm monthly auctions for unforced capacity credits fell from an average of mw month in to an average of mw month in however  higher volumes of energy sales partially offset the decline in prices  as wholesale transactions in increased by about over due to better generating unit availability

ppl believes that its cash on hand  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken as a whole  provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing operating requirements  future security maturities and estimated future capital expenditures 
ppl currently expects cash on hand at the end of to be approximately million  with about billion in syndicated credit facilities 
ppl also expects that cash from operations less payments for capital expenditures  dividends and transition bonds will be positive in however  ppl s cash flows from operations and its access to cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  the following changes in market prices for electricity  changes in commodity prices that may increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount ppl receives from selling power  price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale power markets  ineffectiveness of trading  marketing and risk management policies and programs used to mitigate ppl s risk exposure to adverse energy and fuel prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit  unusual or extreme weather that may damage ppl s transmission and distribution facilities or effect energy sales to customers  reliance on transmission and distribution facilities that ppl does not own or control to deliver its electricity and natural gas  unavailability of generating units due to unscheduled or longer than anticipated generation outages and the resulting loss of revenues and additional costs of replacement electricity  ability to recover  and timeliness and adequacy of recovery of costs associated with regulated utility businesses  and a downgrade in ppl s or ppl s subsidiaries credit ratings that could negatively affect their ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining credit facilities and any new debt 
at december   ppl had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term debt as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term debt at december   and million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term debt at december  the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulted from the following nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by operating activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash used in investing activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by used in financing activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  effect of exchange rates on cash amp  cash equivalents nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  increase decrease in cash amp  cash equivalents nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by  or million in versus  reflecting higher net income adjusted for non cash items  working capital improvements and lower cash income taxes 
in addition  included cash outlays of million for the cancellation of generation projects and million for the termination of a nug contract 
the higher net income in was principally driven by complete ownership of wpd  higher wholesale energy margins  lower interest expense and savings from a workforce reduction program in the us that commenced in the working capital improvements resulted from a decrease in accounts receivable and prepayments 
these positive changes were partially offset by rising transmission and distribution operating costs at ppl electric and other factors 
important elements supporting the stability of ppl s cash provided by operating activities are the long term and intermediate term commitments from wholesale and retail customers and long term fuel supply contracts ppl has in place 
in  ppl energyplus entered into several new wholesale agreements to provide capacity and or electricity to utilities in new jersey  arizona and connecticut 
these agreements supplement previously existing long term contracts with ppl electric  northwestern and the long island power authority see note to the financial statements for additional information 
ppl estimates that  on average  approximately of its expected annual generation output for the period through is committed under long term and intermediate term energy supply contracts 
ppl energyplus also enters into contracts under which it agrees to sell and purchase electricity  natural gas  oil and coal 
these contracts often require cash collateral or other credit enhancement  or reductions or terminations of a portion or the entire contract through cash settlement in the event of a downgrade of ppl or the respective subsidiary s credit ratings or adverse changes in market prices 
for example  in addition to limiting its trading ability  if ppl or its respective subsidiary s ratings were lowered to below investment grade and energy prices increased by  ppl estimates that  based on its december  position  it would have to post collateral of approximately million as compared to million at december  ppl has in place risk management programs that  among other things  are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  counterparty credit quality and the operational performance of its generating units

rating agency actions in in  s amp  p  moody s and fitch reviewed the credit ratings on the debt and preferred securities of ppl and its subsidiaries 
based on their respective reviews  the rating agencies made certain ratings revisions that are described below 
management does not expect these ratings decisions to impact ppl and its subsidiaries ability to raise new debt or equity capital or to have a significant impact on the cost of any new capital or the cost of maintaining their credit facilities 
the ratings of s amp  p  moody s and fitch are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any securities of ppl or its subsidiaries 
such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to their securities 
ppl and domestic subsidiaries s amp  p in april  s amp  p notified ppl  ppl energy supply and ppl electric that it affirmed both the a ratings on ppl electric s first mortgage bonds and senior secured bonds and the bbb corporate credit ratings for ppl and ppl energy supply  lowered the rating on ppl capital funding s senior unsecured debt to bbb from bbb  placed ppl electric on negative outlook 
s amp  p indicated that ppl and ppl energy supply remain on negative outlook  and affirmed the a commercial paper ratings of ppl energy supply and ppl electric 
s amp  p indicated that the rating revision on ppl capital funding s senior unsecured debt is based on the addition of debt at ppl energy supply  which it noted is expected to increase further in the future 
ppl energy supply provides significant cash flows to ppl capital funding to support ppl capital funding s cash requirements 
s amp  p also indicated that the negative outlook for ppl and its subsidiaries reflects its view of weak credit metrics due to low wholesale energy prices 
in december  s amp  p downgraded ppl montana s pass through certificates due to bbb from bbb 
s amp  p indicated that its outlook for these securities remains negative 
s amp  p indicated that its downgrade reflects certain risks that it believes ppl montana faces  including counterparty credit risk resulting from the chapter bankruptcy filing of northwestern  which is ppl montana s largest customer 
s amp  p noted  however  that the bankruptcy court has approved northwestern s request to affirm the power sales agreements with ppl montana and that northwestern has strong incentives to maintain this status 
see note for more detailed information regarding northwestern s bankruptcy filing 
moody s in may  moody s downgraded the credit ratings on the debt and preferred securities of ppl  ppl electric and ppl energy supply 
the ratings downgraded include ppl electric s first mortgage bonds and senior secured bonds  to baa from a  ppl energy supply s senior unsecured notes  to baa from baa  ppl capital funding s senior unsecured debt  to baa from baa  and ppl s senior unsecured debt that is not currently outstanding but that may be issued under ppl s shelf registration statement on file with the sec  to baa from baa 
the moody s ratings outlook is stable for each of ppl  ppl electric  ppl energy supply and ppl capital funding 
neither ppl electric s nor ppl energy supply s short term debt ratings was impacted by moody s long term debt review 
moody s stated that the downgrades reflect its concerns about ppl s high debt levels  ppl energy supply s modest exposure to merchant generation risk  the continued weakness in the wholesale power market and the associated financial impact on ppl energy supply  and concerns regarding the amount of cash flow to be generated from ppl energy supply s non regulated domestic operations and the free cash flow available from its regulated international assets 
however  moody s also indicated that the full requirements contract between ppl electric and ppl energyplus  which previously was approved by the puc and which extends through december  mitigates ppl electric s supply and price risk and provides a predictable stream of cash flows to ppl energy supply during such time period 
moody s also noted that ppl s management had implemented a number of initiatives to strengthen its current credit quality and reduce its debt levels  such as the issuance of over billion of common stock and mandatorily convertible securities over the last few years  a sizeable reduction in planned capital expenditures  the cancellation of projects under development  workforce reductions and write downs of certain investments 
in september  moody s announced that it was placing ppl montana s pass through certificates due under review for possible downgrade 
these securities currently are rated baa by moody s 
moody s stated that its review is prompted by its concerns about the credit profile of ppl montana s largest customer  northwestern  and lower cash flow generation than was forecasted at the time the securities were issued in see note to the financial statements for additional information on northwestern s current situation 
management does not expect any action by moody s based on this review to limit ppl montana s ability to fund its short term liquidity needs 
ppl montana has no plans to raise new long term debt 
any ratings downgrade by moody s would have an insignificant impact on ppl montana s cost of maintaining the credit facility that it has in place with its affiliate 
in addition  management does not expect any ratings downgrade by moody s based on this review to have any adverse impact on the credit ratings of ppl or ppl energy supply 
fitch in may  fitch notified ppl  ppl energy supply and ppl capital funding that it downgraded ppl capital funding s senior unsecured debt to bbb from bbb  downgraded ppl s senior unsecured debt that is not currently outstanding but that may be issued under ppl s shelf registration statement on file with the sec  to bbb from bbb  affirmed both the bbb rating of ppl energy supply s senior unsecured debt  and the f rating of its commercial paper  and placed each of ppl  ppl capital funding and ppl energy supply on negative outlook 
fitch indicated that the revised ratings for ppl and ppl capital funding reflect the structural subordination of the obligations of ppl to those of its subsidiaries and fitch s expectations of lower cash flow from ppl electric until early fitch indicated that the change in outlook for these companies results from the increase during in ppl s generation asset portfolio that is dependent on merchant generation  continued weakness in us merchant energy markets and exposure to international distribution assets primarily in latin america and the uk however  fitch noted that ppl energy supply derives significant earnings and cash flow from long term supply contracts  including the full requirements contract between ppl electric and ppl energyplus  that on average account for about of ppl energy supply s gross margin over the next five years 
wpd and subsidiaries in february  moody s confirmed the ratings of wpdh limited at baa and wpd south west and wpd south wales at baa  and downgraded wpd llp from baa to baa and siuk capital trust i from baa to baa 
the outlook on all ratings was stable 
in march  s amp  p assigned its bbb senior unsecured debt rating to the pound  million bonds issued by wpd south west 
at the same time  the bbb and a corporate credit ratings on siuk limited were withdrawn as a result of the acquisition of its debt by wpd llp 
s amp  p assigned its bbb long term and a short term corporate credit ratings to wpd llp  in line with the ratings on the rest of the wpd group 
following a review of holding companies of uk regulated utilities  in july s amp  p downgraded the long term ratings from bbb to bbb and short term ratings from a to a for both wpdh limited and wpd llp  and retained a negative outlook 
at the same time  s amp  p reaffirmed the credit ratings for wpd south west and wpd south wales at bbb 
s amp  p stated that this is in line with s amp  p uk s recently announced implementation of a new methodology related to uk electric distribution holding companies  whereby electric distribution operating companies rated in the bbb category will have the parent holding company wpdh limited notched down by two categories from the operating company rating level 
wpd s management does not expect the placement of wpd on negative outlook to limit its ability to fund its short term liquidity needs or access to new long term debt or to impact materially the cost of any new long term debt 
subsequent events in february  ppl successfully remarketed an aggregate liquidation amount of million of the ppl capital funding trust i trust preferred securities that were a component of the peps units

both the trust preferred securities that were remarketed and those that were not remarketed will mature in may additionally in february  ppl capital funding issued million of senior unsecured notes guaranteed by ppl 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate of per year that is payable semiannually on march and september of each year  from september  through the maturity date of march  the senior notes are not redeemable by ppl or ppl capital funding  and the holders will not be entitled to require ppl or ppl capital funding to repurchase the senior notes before maturity

also in february  notice was provided to the holders of the trust preferred securities that ppl has elected to liquidate ppl capital funding trust i and cause the distribution of the underlying ppl capital funding subordinated notes due to the holders of the trust preferred securities 
the liquidation date is expected to occur on or about march  from and after the liquidation date  the trust preferred securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and the underlying ppl capital funding subordinated notes will be held by the former holders of the trust preferred securities 
finally  in february  ppl announced an increase to its quarterly common stock dividend  payable april   to cents per share equivalent to per annum 
future dividends  declared at the discretion of the board of directors  will be dependent upon future earnings  cash flows  financial requirements and other factors

some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that  if not met  would limit or restrict the affiliates access to funds under these financing arrangements  require early maturity of such arrangements or limit ppl s ability to enter into certain transactions 
at this time  ppl believes that these covenants will not limit access to the relevant funding sources 
ppl has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope of fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no

risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other market risk background market risk is the potential loss ppl may incur as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument 
ppl is exposed to market risk from commodity price risk for energy and energy related products associated with the sale of electricity  the purchase of fuel for the generating assets  and energy trading activities  interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt and the fair value of fixed rate debt used to finance operations  as well as the fair value of debt securities invested in by ppl s nuclear decommissioning fund  foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in affiliates in latin america and europe  as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars  and equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of equity securities invested in by ppl s nuclear decommissioning fund 
ppl has a risk management policy approved by the board of directors to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk 
credit risk is discussed below 
the rmc  comprised of senior management and chaired by the vice president risk management  oversees the risk management function 
key risk control activities designed to monitor compliance with risk policies and detailed programs include  but are not limited to  credit review and approval  validation of transactions and market prices  verification of risk and transaction limits  sensitivity analyses  and daily portfolio reporting  including open positions  mark to market valuations and other risk measurement metrics 
in addition  efforts are ongoing to develop systems to improve the timeliness  quality and breadth of market and credit risk information 
the forward looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to reliance on model assumptions 
actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
contract valuation ppl utilizes forward contracts  futures contracts  options  swaps and tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency volatility 
when available  quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial instrument 
this may include exchange prices  the average mid point bid ask spreads obtained from brokers  or an independent valuation by an external source  such as a bank 
however  market prices for energy or energy related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity 
if no active trading market exists  contracts are valued using internally developed models  which are then reviewed by an independent  internal group 
although ppl believes that its valuation methods are reasonable  changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values and realization in future periods 
to record derivatives at their fair value  ppl discounts the forward values using libor 
additionally  ppl reduces derivative assets carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality and potential illiquidity in the market the credit adjustment takes into account the probability of default  as calculated by an independent service  for each counterparty that has an out of the money position with ppl 
the liquidity adjustment takes into account the fact that it may not be appropriate to value contracts at the midpoint of the bid ask spread 
ppl might have to accept the bid price if ppl wanted to close an open sales position or ppl might have to accept the ask price if ppl wanted to close an open purchase position 
accounting and reporting ppl follows the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  and interpreted by dig issues together  sfas  eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  and eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
 to account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability unless they meet sfas s criteria for exclusion and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  which amends and clarifies sfas to improve financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are accounted for similarly  sfas clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
additionally  sfas placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or normal sale exception 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june   except certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that did not yet exist 
ppl adopted sfas as of july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on ppl 
ppl adopted the final provisions of eitf during the fourth quarter of as such  ppl now reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in the net energy trading margins line on the statement of income 
non derivative contracts that met the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf  accounting for energy trading and risk management activities are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  unrealized gains and losses are not reflected in the financial statements 
prior periods were reclassified 
no cumulative effect adjustment was required upon adoption 
ppl has adopted the final provisions of eitf prospectively as of october  as a result of this adoption  non trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points 
a major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available 
see note to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption of eitf ppl s short term derivative contracts are recorded as price risk management assets and price risk management liabilities on the balance sheet 
long term derivative contracts are included in regulatory and other noncurrent assets other and deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities other 
accounting designation energy contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting 
for energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative  the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine their accounting designation 
these designations are verified by ppl s risk control group on a daily basis 
the following is a summary of the guidelines that have been provided to the traders who are responsible for contract designation for derivative energy contracts due to the adoption of sfas any wholesale and retail contracts to sell or buy electricity and the related capacity that are expected to be delivered from ppl s generation or that are approved by the rmc to fulfill a strategic element of ppl s overall marketing strategy are considered normal 
these transactions are not recorded in the financial statements and have no earnings impact until delivery 
physical electricity only transactions can receive cash flow hedge treatment if all of the qualifications under sfas are met 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur 
physical electricity purchases that increase ppl s long position and any energy sale or purchase judged a market call are considered speculative  with unrealized gains or losses recorded immediately through earnings 
financial transactions  which can be settled in cash  cannot be considered normal because they do not require physical delivery 
these transactions receive cash flow hedge treatment if they lock in the price ppl will receive or pay for energy expected to be generated or purchased in the spot market 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions that receive cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur 
physical and financial transactions for gas and oil to meet fuel and retail requirements can receive cash flow hedge treatment if they lock in the price ppl will pay in the spot market 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur 
option contracts that do not meet the requirements of dig issue c  scope exceptions interpreting the normal purchases and normal sales exception as an election  do not receive hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through earnings 
in addition to energy related transactions  ppl enters into financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances 
ppl also enters into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations 
as with energy transactions  the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the transaction determine a contract s accounting designation  which is subsequently verified by ppl s risk control group on a daily basis 
the following is a summary of certain guidelines that have been provided to the treasury department  which is responsible for contract designation transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance are considered cash flow hedges 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income and are amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt 
transactions entered into to hedge fluctuations in the value of existing debt are considered fair value hedges with no earnings impact until the debt is terminated because the hedged debt is also marked to market 
transactions entered into to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations are considered net investment hedges 
to the extent that the derivatives are highly effective at hedging the value of the net investment  gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and will not be recorded in earnings until the investment is disposed of 
transactions which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market through earnings 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is one of ppl s most significant risks due to the level of investment that ppl maintains in its generation assets  coupled with the volatility of prices for energy and energy related products 
several factors influence price levels and volatilities 
these factors include  but are not limited to  seasonal changes in demand  weather conditions  available generating assets within regions  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  market liquidity  and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations 
to hedge the impact of market price fluctuations on ppl s energy related assets  liabilities and other contractual arrangements  ppl energyplus sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under ferc market based tariffs throughout the us and enters into financial exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
because of the generating assets ppl owns or controls  the majority of ppl s energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge accounting 
within ppl s hedge portfolio  the decision to enter into energy contracts hinges on the expected value of ppl s generation 
to address this risk  ppl takes a conservative approach in determining the number of mwhs that are available to be sold forward 
in this regard  ppl reduces the maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors planned maintenance  unplanned outages and economic conditions 
the potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit 
another reduction  representing the unplanned outage rate  is the amount of mwhs that historically is not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment breakage 
finally  the potential output of certain plants like peaking units are reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow them to economically run during all hours 
ppl s non trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts 
the net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute 
ppl analyzes historical on peak and off peak usage patterns  as well as spot prices and weather patterns  to determine a monthly level of a block of electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility 
on a forward basis  ppl reserves a block amount of generation for full requirements energy contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks 
anticipated usage patterns and peaks are affected by expected load growth  regional economic drivers and seasonality

the fair value of electricity positions recorded above use the midpoint of the bid ask spreads obtained through otc brokers 
on average  otc quotes for forwards and swaps of natural gas and power extend one and two years into the future 
the prices based on models and other valuation methods category includes the value of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point  or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or otc broker 
additionally  this category includes strip transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to monthly prices as appropriate 
because of ppl s efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets  ppl has open contractual positions 
if ppl were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy under its agreements  under certain circumstances it would be required to pay damages 
these damages would be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or energy and the contract price of the undelivered capacity or energy 
depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets  such damages could be significant 
extreme weather conditions  unplanned power plant outages  transmission disruptions  non performance by counterparties or their counterparties with which it has power contracts and other factors could affect ppl s ability to meet its firm capacity or energy obligations  or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and energy 
although ppl attempts to mitigate these risks  there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations  that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform  or that it will not experience counterparty non performance in the future 
as of december   ppl estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its non trading portfolio by approximately million  which is equal to the estimated decrease at december nbsp  however  the change in the value of the non trading portfolio would have been substantially offset by an increase in the value of the underlying commodity  the electricity generated  because these contracts serve to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity 
additionally  the value of ppl s unsold generation would be improved 
because ppl s electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position  the adverse movement in prices is usually an increase in prices 
conversely  because ppl s commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net purchase position  the adverse movement in prices is usually a decrease in prices 
if both of these scenarios happened  the implied margins for the unsold generation would increase 
ppl also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities 
as a result  ppl may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated 
the margins from these trading activities are shown in the statement of income as net energy trading margins

as of december   ppl estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by million compared to a decrease of million at december  in accordance with its marketing strategy  ppl does not completely hedge its generation output or fuel requirements 
ppl estimates that for its entire portfolio  including all generation and physical and financial energy positions  a adverse change in power prices across all geographic zones and time periods will decrease expected gross margins by about million 
similarly  a adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices will decrease gross margins by million 
interest rate risk ppl and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations 
ppl utilizes various financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio  adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in us treasury rates and interest rate spreads over treasuries in anticipation of future financing  when appropriate 
risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of ppl s debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   ppl s potential annual exposure to increased interest expense  based on a increase in interest rates  was estimated at million  compared to a million increase at december  ppl is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its us and international debt portfolios 
at december   ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was million  compared to million at december  ppl utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse interest rate movements for future anticipated financing 
while ppl is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments  they are designed such that an economic loss in value should generally be offset by interest rate savings at the time the future anticipated financing is completed 
at december   ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared to an million exposure at december foreign currency risk ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk  primarily through investments in affiliates in latin america and europe 
in addition  ppl may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars 
ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures  including firm commitments  recognized assets or liabilities and net investments 
in addition  ppl enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk 
ppl holds contracts for the forward purchase of million euros to pay for certain equipment of ppl susquehanna in the estimated value of these forward purchases as of december nbsp   being the amount ppl would receive to terminate them  was million 
ppl executed forward sale transactions for pound  million to hedge a portion of its net investment in wpdh limited 
the estimated value of these agreements as of december  was million  being the amount ppl would pay to terminate the transactions 
ppl executed forward sale transactions for billion chilean pesos to hedge a portion of its net investment in its subsidiary that owns cge 
the estimated value of these agreements as of december  was million  being the amount ppl would pay to terminate the transactions 
to protect expected income in chilean pesos  ppl entered into average rate options for billion chilean pesos 
at december nbsp   the market value of these positions  representing the amount ppl would pay to terminate them  was insignificant 
wpdh limited executed cross currency swaps totaling billion to hedge the interest payments and value of its us dollar denominated bonds 
the estimated value of this position on december   being the amount ppl would pay to terminate them  including accrued interest  was million 
on the statement of income  gains and loses associated with hedges of interest payments denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in interest expense 
gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected in depreciation 
gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet until the investment is disposed 
nuclear decommissioning fund securities price risk in connection with certain nrc requirements  ppl susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the susquehanna station 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed rate  fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on ppl s balance sheet 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund susquehanna s decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs 
however  the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets  and the values of fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ppl susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement 
at december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates and a decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets  as compared to a million reduction at december  ppl electric s restructuring settlement agreement provides for the collection of authorized nuclear decommissioning costs through the ctc 
additionally  ppl electric is permitted to seek recovery from customers of up to of certain increases in these costs 
under the power supply agreements between ppl electric and ppl energyplus  these revenues are passed on to ppl energyplus 
similarly  these revenues are passed on to ppl susquehanna under a power supply agreement between ppl energyplus and ppl susquehanna 
these revenues are used to fund the trusts 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that ppl would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
ppl maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings criteria and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk 
however  ppl has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities  natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing and trading companies 
these concentrations of counterparties may impact ppl s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic  regulatory or other conditions 
as discussed above under contract valuation  ppl records certain non performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out of the money from the counterparty s standpoint will default in its performance  in which case ppl would have to sell into a lower priced market or purchase from a higher priced market 
these reserves are reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in price risk management assets on the balance sheet 
ppl also records reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries ppl has made but not yet billed 
these reserves are reflected in unbilled revenues on the balance sheet 
ppl has also established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the california iso for which ppl has not yet been paid  as well as a reserve related to ppl s exposure as a result of the enron bankruptcy  which are reflected in accounts receivable on the balance sheet

new accounting standards fin and fin r in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin clarifies that variable interest entities  as defined therein  that do not disperse risks among the parties involved should be consolidated by the entity that is determined to be the primary beneficiary 
fin also requires certain disclosures to be made by the primary beneficiary and by an enterprise that holds a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity but is not the primary beneficiary 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after january  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before february   fin was originally required to be adopted no later than the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  however  in october  the fasb issued fsp fin  effective date of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which delayed the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to interests held by public entities in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  until the end of the first interim period ending after december  in december  the fasb revised fin by issuing interpretation no 
revised december  which is known as fin r and replaces fin fin r does not change the general consolidation concepts of fin among other things  fin r again changes the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to certain entities  clarifies certain provisions of fin and provides additional scope exceptions for certain types of businesses 
for entities to which the provisions of fin have not been applied as of december   fin r provides that a public entity that is not a small business issuer should apply the provisions of fin or fin r as follows i fin r shall be applied to all entities no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  and ii fin or fin r should be applied to entities that are considered to be spes no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  as permitted by fin r  ppl adopted fin effective december  for entities created before february  that are considered to be spes 
this adoption resulted in the consolidation of the lessors under the operating leases for the sundance  university park and lower mt 
bethel generation facilities  as well as the deconsolidation of two wholly owned trusts 
see below for further discussion 
also  as permitted by fin r  ppl deferred the application of fin for other entities and plans to adopt fin r for all entities on march ppl is in the process of evaluating entities in which it holds a variable interest in accordance with fin r 
ppl is currently not aware of any variable interest entities that are not consolidated as of december  but which it will be required to consolidate in accordance with fin r effective march  as it continues to evaluate the impact of applying fin r  ppl may identify additional entities that it would need to consolidate 
additional entities consolidated the lessors under the operating leases for the sundance  university park and lower mt 
bethel generation facilities are variable interest entities that are considered to be spes 
ppl is the primary beneficiary of these entities 
consequently  ppl was required to consolidate the financial statements of the lessors effective december  upon initial consolidation  ppl recognized billion of additional assets and liabilities on its balance sheet and a charge of million  after tax  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the additional assets consist principally of the generation facilities  and the additional liabilities consist principally of the lease financing

entities deconsolidated effective december   ppl deconsolidated ppl capital funding trust i and siuk capital trust i 
these trusts are considered to be spes and were deconsolidated because ppl is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts under current interpretations of fin therefore  the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely company debentures amounting to million  which would have been recorded as a component of long term debt in in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  if the trusts were consolidated  are not reflected in ppl s balance sheet at december  instead  the subordinated debt securities that support the trust preferred securities are reflected in long term debt with affiliate trusts as of december  see below for further discussion 
the trusts hold subordinated debt securities of ppl capital funding  in the case of ppl capital funding trust i  and wpd llp  in the case of siuk capital trust i 
as a result of deconsolidating the trusts  the subordinated debt securities are no longer eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   million is reflected as long term debt with affiliate trusts in ppl s balance sheet 
the effect on the balance sheet as a result of deconsolidating the trusts was an increase in both total assets and total liabilities of million 
the increase in assets relates to the investments in the common securities of the trusts  which are no longer eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in liabilities consists primarily of the difference between the carrying value of the preferred securities issued by the trusts compared to the carrying value of the subordinated debt securities of ppl capital funding and wpd llp 
the deconsolidation of the trusts did not impact the earnings of ppl 
see the statement of company obligated mandatorily redeemable securities contained in the financial statements for a discussion of the trusts and their preferred securities  as well as the subordinated debt securities issued to the trusts

application of critical accounting policies ppl s financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods  assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of ppl  and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements 
these accounting policies are also discussed in note to the financial statements 
ppl s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions regarding them  with its audit committee 
in addition  ppl s senior management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee

nbsp  nbsp  pension and other postretirement benefits ppl follows the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the company will record currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting discount rates  ppl considers fixed income security yield rates 
at december   ppl decreased the discount rate for its domestic plans from to as a result of decreased fixed income security returns 
for its international plans  ppl decreased the discount rate for its international plans from to at december  in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl considers tax implications  past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
at december   ppl s expected return on plan assets remained at for its domestic pension plans and for its other postretirement plans 
for its international plans  ppl maintained a weighted average of as the expected return on plan assets at december  in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl s rate of compensation increase remained at for its domestic plans 
for its international plans  ppl s rate of compensation increase remained at at december  in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl considers past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december nbsp   ppl s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on projected benefit obligations  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other comprehensive income oci 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and oci by a similar amount in the opposite direction

at december   ppl had recognized accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities totaling million  included in deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities other on the balance sheet 
at december   ppl had recognized million of prepaid postretirement benefit costs included in prepayments on the balance sheet 
ppl s total projected obligation for these benefits was approximately billion  which was offset by billion of assets held in various trusts 
however  these amounts are not fully reflected in the current financial statements due to the delayed recognition criteria of the accounting standards for these obligations 
in  ppl recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged to operating expenses of million 
this amount represents a million decrease from the credit recognized during this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate at december  as a result of the decrease in the assumed discount rate at december   ppl was required to increase its recognized additional minimum pension liability 
recording the change in the additional minimum liability resulted in a million increase to the pension related charge to oci  net of taxes  translation adjustment and unrecognized prior service costs  with no effect on net income 
this charge increased the pension related balance in oci  which is a reduction to shareowners equity  to million at december  the charges to oci will reverse in future periods if the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation

nbsp  nbsp  asset impairment ppl and its subsidiaries review long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
assets subject to this review  for which impairments have been recorded in or prior years  include international equity investments  new generation assets  consolidated international energy projects and goodwill 
ppl performs impairment analyses for tangible long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for long lived assets to be held and used  sfas requires companies to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
in determining asset impairments  management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate the fair value of an investment 
fair value is developed through consideration of several valuation methods including comparison to market multiples  comparison to similar recent sales transactions  comparison to replacement cost and discounted cash flow 
discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash flow streams  applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the cash flow streams  and then assessing the probability of the various cash flow scenarios 
the impairment is then recorded based on the excess of the carrying value of the investment over fair value 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
during  ppl and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas fired generation assets for impairment  as events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of these investments may not be recoverable 
ppl did not record an impairment of its new gas fired generation assets in for these impairment analyses  the most significant assumption was the estimate of future cash flows 
ppl estimates future cash flow using information from its corporate business plan adjusted for any recent sales or purchase commitments 
key factors that impact cash flows include projected prices for electricity and gas as well as firm sales and purchase commitments 
a decrease in estimated future cash flows for certain in service gas fired generation assets would have resulted in an impairment charge 
ppl performs impairment analyses of goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires an annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization 
ppl completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of this test did not result in an impairment 
ppl s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the determination of fair value 
ppl determined fair value based upon discounted cash flows 
a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of or an increase of the discount rates by basis points would have resulted in impairment 
nbsp  nbsp  leasing ppl applies the provisions of sfas  accounting for leases  to all leasing transactions 
in addition  ppl applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and the eitf that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing arrangements 
in general  there are two types of leases from a lessee s perspective operating leases leases accounted for off balance sheet  and capital leases leases capitalized on the balance sheet 
in accounting for leases  management makes various assumptions  including the discount rate  the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated useful life  in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or capital 
changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease  thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition to uncertainty inherent in management s assumptions  leasing transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when they involve sale leaseback accounting leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased assets  synthetic leases leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes  and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets 
at december   ppl subsidiaries participated in one significant sale leaseback transaction which has been accounted for as an operating lease 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the lessors under certain synthetic operating leases previously accounted for off balance sheet were consolidated effective december  as a result of the adoption of fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 for certain entities 
sale leaseback in july  ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four year operating leases 
this transaction is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with current rules related to sale leaseback arrangements 
if for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements for off balance sheet operating lease treatment as a sale leaseback  ppl would have approximately million of additional assets and liabilities recorded on its balance sheet at december nbsp  and would have recorded additional expenses currently estimated at million  after tax  in see note to the financial statements for additional information related to operating leases 
nbsp  nbsp  loss contingencies ppl periodically records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
the accrual of a loss contingency involves considerable judgment on the part of management 
the accounting aspects of loss contingencies include the initial identification and recording of the loss contingency  the determination of a triggering event for reducing a recorded loss contingency  and the on going assessment as to whether a recorded loss contingency is reasonable 
initial identification and recording of the loss contingency ppl uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
ppl continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl has identified certain events which could give rise to a loss  but which do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of potential loss contingencies  most of which have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas reducing recorded loss contingencies when a loss contingency is recorded  ppl identifies  where applicable  the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss contingency 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events which provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss contingencies certain loss contingencies are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the recorded liability for above market nug purchase commitments  which is described below 
this loss contingency is being reduced over the lives of the nug purchase contracts 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted 
environmental loss contingencies are reduced when ppl makes payments for environmental remediation 
on going assessment of recorded loss contingencies ppl reviews its loss contingencies on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are reasonable 
this involves on going communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  managers in various operational areas and other parties 
all three aspects of accounting for loss contingencies the initial identification and recording of a probable loss  the identification of triggering events to reduce the loss contingency  and the ongoing assessment of the reasonableness of a recorded loss contingency require significant judgment by ppl s management 
the largest loss contingency on ppl s balance sheet  and the loss contingency that changed most significantly in  was for above market nug purchase commitments 
this loss contingency reflects the estimated difference between the above market contract terms under the purchase commitments  and the fair value of electricity 
this loss contingency was originally recorded at million in  when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
under regulatory accounting  ppl electric recorded the above market cost of the purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as incurred basis  since these costs were recovered in regulated rates 
when the generation business was deregulated  the loss contingency associated with the commitment to make above market nug purchases was recorded 
this loss contingency for the above market portion of nug purchase commitments was recorded because it was probable that the loss had been incurred and the estimate of future energy prices could be reasonably determined  using the then forward prices of electricity and capacity 
this loss contingency was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july  corporate realignment 
the above market loss contingency was million at december nbsp  when the loss contingency related to nug purchases was recorded in  ppl electric established the triggering events for when the loss contingency would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the lives of the nug contracts 
all but one of the nug contracts expire by  with the last one ending in ppl energyplus reduces the above market nug liability based on the aforementioned schedule 
as ppl energyplus reduces the liability for the above market nug purchases  it offsets the actual cost of nug purchases  thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in line with market prices 
ppl energyplus assessed the remaining million above market liability at december   comparing the projected electricity purchases under the terms of the nug contracts  with the purchases assuming projected market prices for the energy 
this assessment was based on projected pjm market prices  including capacity  through the assessment also used sensitivities around the market prices  adjusting such prices upwards and downwards by 
the assessment is dependent on the market prices of energy and the estimated output levels of the nugs 
market prices of energy are dependent on many variables  including growth in electricity demand in pjm  available generation  and changes in regulatory and economic conditions 
accordingly  market price sensitivities were used in the assessment 
if estimated market prices were adjusted upwards by in each of the years from through  the contingency for the above market nug purchase commitments would be approximately million 
conversely  if estimated market prices were adjusted downwards by during the remaining term of the nug contracts  the contingency for the above market nug purchase commitments would be approximately million 
the recorded above market liability of million at december  falls within the range calculated in the year end assessment 
as noted above  it is very difficult to estimate future electricity prices  which are dependent on many variables and subject to significant volatility 
however  ppl s management believes that the current recorded nug above market liability was fairly stated at december  nbsp  nbsp  asset retirement obligations in  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized as a liability in the financial statements 
the initial obligation should be measured at the estimated fair value 
an equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
until the obligation is settled  the liability should be increased  through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement  for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in determining asset retirement obligations  management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value 
fair value is developed through consideration of estimated retirement costs in today s dollars  inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the asset retirement obligation was incurred 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of asset retirement obligations could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
ppl adopted sfas effective january  initial adoption of the new rules resulted in an increase in net pp amp  e of million  reversal of previously recorded liabilities of million  recognition of asset retirement obligations of million  recognition of a deferred tax liability of million and a cumulative effect of adoption that increased net income by million 
at december   ppl had asset retirement obligations totaling million recorded on the balance sheet 
ppl s most significant assumptions surrounding asset retirement obligations are the forecasted retirement cost  discount rate and inflation rate 
a variance in the forecasted retirement cost  discount rate or inflation rate could have a significant impact on the aro liability and the cumulative effect gain 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in these assumptions upon initial adoption 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption only

ppl energy supply  llc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ppl energy supply is an energy company with headquarters in allentown  pa 
see item  business background  for a description of ppl energy supply s domestic and international businesses 
see exhibit in item for a listing of its principal subsidiaries 
through its subsidiaries  ppl energy supply is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets the northeastern and western us and in the delivery of electricity in the uk and latin america 
ppl energy supply s strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with load  or customer demand  under long term and intermediate term contracts with creditworthy counterparties 
ppl energy supply s strategy for its international electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these businesses at the highest level of quality and reliability and at the most efficient cost 
ppl energy supply faces several risks in its generation business 
the principal risks are electricity wholesale price risk  fuel supply and price risk  power plant performance and counterparty credit risk 
ppl energy supply attempts to manage these risks through various means 
for instance  ppl energy supply operates a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to geography  fuel source  cost structure and operating characteristics 
ppl energy supply is focused on the operating efficiency and maintaining the availability of these power plants 
in addition  ppl energy supply has in place and continues to pursue long term and intermediate term contracts for energy sales and fuel supply  and other means  to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes in the difference  or margin  between the cost to produce electricity and the price at which ppl energy supply sells it 
ppl energy supply s contractual commitments for energy sales are primarily satisfied through its own generation assets ie  ppl energy supply primarily markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets through integrated generation  marketing and trading functions 
finally  ppl energy supply attempts to reduce its exposure to the various risks it faces through its risk management program  which  among other things  includes an evaluation of market risks and the creditworthiness of all counterparties 
ppl energy supply s international electricity delivery businesses are rate regulated 
accordingly  these businesses are subject to regulatory risks in terms of the costs that they may recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer rates 
the principal challenge that ppl energy supply faces in its international electricity delivery businesses is to maintain high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost effective manner 
ppl energy supply faces certain financial risks by conducting international operations  such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
ppl energy supply attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management program 
a key challenge for ppl energy supply s business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile 
in the past few years  investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry have been particularly focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of energy companies 
ppl energy supply is focused on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is to provide information concerning ppl energy supply s past and expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the risks and challenges outlined above 
specifically results of operations provides an overview of ppl energy supply s operating results in  and  starting with a review of earnings 
the earnings review includes a listing of certain unusual items that had significant impacts in these years  and it also includes a description of key factors that management expects may impact future earnings 
results of operations also includes an explanation of changes during this three year period in significant income statement components  such as energy margins  utility revenues  operation and maintenance expenses  interest expense  income taxes and cumulative effects of accounting changes 
financial condition liquidity provides an analysis of ppl energy supply s liquidity position and credit profile  including its sources of cash including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow and uses of cash including contractual commitments and capital expenditure requirements and the key risks and uncertainties that impact ppl energy supply s past and future liquidity position and financial condition 
this subsection also includes an explanation of recent rating agency decisions affecting ppl energy supply  as well as a listing of ppl energy supply s current credit ratings 
financial condition risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other includes an explanation of ppl energy supply s risk management program relating to market risk ie  commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk ie  counterparty credit risk 
new accounting standards provides a description of accounting standards that impact ppl energy supply s financial statements and that were implemented in or are pending adoption 
application of critical accounting policies provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl energy supply and that require ppl energy supply s management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments 
although ppl energy supply s management believes that these estimates  assumptions and other judgments are appropriate  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  changes in the estimates  assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on ppl energy supply s results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in ppl energy supply s financial statements 
the information provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with ppl energy supply s financial statements and the notes thereto

the higher net income in was principally driven by complete ownership in wpd  higher wholesale energy margins  lower interest expense and savings from a workforce reduction program in the us that commenced in important elements supporting the stability of ppl energy supply s cash provided by operating activities are the long term and intermediate term commitments from wholesale and retail customers and long term fuel supply contracts ppl energy supply has in place 
in  ppl energyplus entered into several new wholesale agreements to provide capacity and or electricity to utilities in new jersey  arizona and connecticut 
these agreements supplement previously existing long term contracts with ppl electric  northwestern and the long island power authority see note to the financial statements for additional information 
ppl energy supply estimates that  on average  approximately of its expected annual generation output for the period through is committed under long term and intermediate term energy supply contracts 
ppl energyplus also enters into contracts under which it agrees to sell and purchase electricity  natural gas  oil and coal 
these contracts often require cash collateral or other credit enhancement  or reductions or terminations of a portion or the entire contract through cash settlement in the event of a downgrade of ppl energy supply or the respective subsidiary s credit ratings or adverse changes in market prices

ppl energy supply s subsidiaries lease vehicles  office space  land  buildings  personal computers and other equipment under master operating lease arrangements 
these leasing structures provide ppl energy supply with additional operating and financing flexibility 
the operating leases contain covenants that are typical for these agreements  such as maintaining insurance  maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other fees 
failure to meet these covenants could limit or restrict access to these funds or require early payment of obligations 
at this time  ppl energy supply believes that these covenants will not limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or termination of the leases 
ppl energy supply  through its subsidiary ppl montana  leases a interest in colstrip units and and a interest in unit  under four year non cancelable operating leases 
these operating leases are not recorded on ppl energy supply s balance sheet  which is in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
the leases place certain restrictions on ppl montana s ability to incur additional debt  sell assets and declare dividends 
at this time  ppl energy supply believes that these restrictions will not limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or termination of the leases

rating agency actions in in  s amp  p  moody s and fitch reviewed the credit ratings on the debt of ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries 
based on their respective reviews  the rating agencies made certain ratings revisions that are described below 
management does not expect these ratings decisions to impact ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries ability to raise new debt or equity capital or to have a significant impact on the cost of any new capital or the cost of maintaining their credit facilities 
the ratings of s amp  p  moody s and fitch are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any securities of ppl energy supply or its subsidiaries 
such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to their securities 
ppl energy supply s amp  p in april  s amp  p notified ppl energy supply that it affirmed the bbb corporate credit rating for ppl energy supply and the a commercial paper rating of ppl energy supply 
s amp  p also indicated that ppl energy supply remains on negative outlook based on s amp  p s view of weak debt protection measures due to low wholesale energy prices 
in december  s amp  p downgraded ppl montana s pass through certificates due to bbb from bbb 
s amp  p indicated that its outlook for these securities remains negative 
s amp  p indicated that its downgrade reflects certain risks that it believes ppl montana faces  including counterparty credit risk resulting from the chapter bankruptcy filing of northwestern  which is ppl montana s largest customer 
s amp  p noted  however  that the bankruptcy court has approved northwestern s request to affirm the power sales agreements with ppl montana and that northwestern has strong incentives to maintain this status 
see note to the financial statements for more detailed information regarding northwestern s bankruptcy filing 
moody s in may  moody s downgraded the credit ratings on ppl energy supply s senior unsecured notes  to baa from baa 
the moody s ratings outlook is stable for ppl energy supply 
ppl energy supply s short term debt rating was not impacted by moody s long term debt review 
moody s stated that the downgrades reflect its concerns about ppl energy supply s modest exposure to merchant generation risk  the continued weakness in the wholesale power market and the associated financial impact on ppl energy supply  and concerns regarding the amount of cash flow to be generated from ppl energy supply s domestic operations and the free cash flow available from its regulated international assets 
however  moody s also indicated that the full requirements contract between ppl electric and ppl energyplus  which previously was approved by the puc and which extends through december  provides a predictable stream of cash flows to ppl energy supply during such time period 
moody s also viewed favorably certain actions taken by ppl energy supply  including a sizeable reduction in planned capital expenditures  the cancellation of projects under development  workforce reductions and write downs of certain investments 
in september  moody s announced that it was placing ppl montana s pass through certificates due under review for possible downgrade 
these securities currently are rated baa by moody s 
moody s stated that its review is prompted by its concerns about the credit profile of ppl montana s largest customer  northwestern  and lower cash flow generation than was forecasted at the time the securities were issued in see note to the financial statements for additional information on northwestern s current situation 
management does not expect any action by moody s based on this review to limit ppl montana s ability to fund its short term liquidity needs 
ppl montana has no plans to raise new long term debt 
any ratings downgrade by moody s would have an insignificant impact on ppl montana s cost of maintaining the credit facility that it has in place with its affiliate 
in addition  management does not expect any ratings downgrade by moody s based on this review to have any adverse impact on the credit ratings of ppl energy supply 
fitch in may  fitch notified ppl energy supply that it affirmed the bbb rating of ppl energy supply s senior unsecured debt and the f rating of its commercial paper  and that it placed ppl energy supply on negative outlook 
fitch indicated that the change in outlook for ppl energy supply results from the increase during in ppl energy supply s generation asset portfolio that is dependent on merchant generation  continued weakness in us merchant energy markets and exposure to international distribution assets primarily in latin america and the uk however  fitch noted that ppl energy supply derives significant earnings and cash flow from long term supply contracts  including the full requirements contract between ppl electric and ppl energyplus  that on average account for about of ppl energy supply s gross margin over the next five years 
wpd and subsidiaries in february  moody s confirmed the ratings of wpdh limited at baa and wpd south west and wpd south wales at baa  and downgraded wpd llp from baa to baa and siuk capital trust i from baa to baa 
the outlook on all ratings was stable 
in march  s amp  p assigned its bbb senior unsecured debt rating to the pound  million bonds issued by wpd south west 
at the same time  the bbb and a corporate credit ratings on siuk limited were withdrawn as a result of the acquisition of its debt by wpd llp 
s amp  p assigned its bbb long term and a short term corporate credit ratings to wpd llp  in line with the ratings on the rest of the wpd group 
following a review of holding companies of uk  regulated utilities  in july s amp  p downgraded the long term ratings from bbb to bbb and short term ratings from a to a for both wpdh limited and wpd llp  and retained a negative outlook 
at the same time  s amp  p reaffirmed the credit ratings for wpd south west and wpd south wales at bbb 
s amp  p stated that this is in line with s amp  p uk s recently announced implementation of a new methodology related to uk electric distribution holding companies  whereby electric distribution operating companies rated in the bbb category will have the parent holding company wpdh limited notched down by two categories from the operating company rating level 
wpd s management does not expect the placement of wpd on negative outlook to limit its ability to fund its short term liquidity needs or access to new long term debt or to impact the cost of any new long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements ppl energy supply provides guarantees for certain affiliate financing arrangements that enable certain transactions 
some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that  if not met  would limit or restrict the affiliates access to funds under these financing arrangements  require early maturity of such arrangements or limit ppl energy supply s ability to enter into certain transactions 
at this time  ppl energy supply believes that these covenants will not limit access to the relevant funding sources 
ppl energy supply has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope of fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no

risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other market risk background market risk is the potential loss ppl energy supply may incur as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument 
ppl energy supply is exposed to market risk from commodity price risk for energy and energy related products associated with the sale of electricity  the purchase of fuel for the generating assets  and energy trading activities  interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt and the fair value of fixed rate debt used to finance operations  as well as the fair value of debt securities invested in by ppl energy supply s nuclear decommissioning fund  foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in affiliates in latin america and europe  as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars  and equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of equity securities invested in by ppl energy supply s nuclear decommissioning fund 
ppl energy supply has a risk management policy approved by ppl s board of directors to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk 
credit risk is discussed below 
the rmc  comprised of senior management and chaired by the vice president risk management  oversees the risk management function 
key risk control activities designed to monitor compliance with risk policies and detailed programs include  but are not limited to  credit review and approval  validation of transactions and market prices  verification of risk and transaction limits  sensitivity analyses  and daily portfolio reporting  including open positions  mark to market valuations and other risk measurement metrics 
in addition  efforts are ongoing to develop systems to improve the timeliness  quality and breadth of market and credit risk information 
the forward looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to reliance on model assumptions 
actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
contract valuation ppl energy supply utilizes forward contracts  futures contracts  options  swaps and tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency volatility 
when available  quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial instrument 
this may include exchange prices  the average mid point bid ask spreads obtained from brokers  or an independent valuation by an external source  such as a bank 
however  market prices for energy or energy related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity 
if no active trading market exists  contracts are valued using internally developed models  which are then reviewed by an independent  internal group 
although ppl energy supply believes that its valuation methods are reasonable  changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values and realization in future periods 
to record derivatives at their fair value  ppl energy supply discounts the forward values using libor 
additionally  ppl energy supply reduces derivative assets carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality and potential illiquidity in the market the credit adjustment takes into account the probability of default  as calculated by an independent service  for each counterparty that has an out of the money position with ppl energy supply 
the liquidity adjustment takes into account the fact that it may not be appropriate to value contracts at the midpoint of the bid ask spread 
ppl energy supply might have to accept the bid price if ppl energy supply wanted to close an open sales position or ppl energy supply might have to accept the ask price if ppl energy supply wanted to close an open purchase position 
accounting and reporting ppl energy supply follows the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  and interpreted by dig issues together  sfas  eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  and eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
 to account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability unless they meet sfas s criteria for exclusion and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  which amends and clarifies sfas to improve financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are accounted for similarly  sfas clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
additionally  sfas placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or normal sale exception 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june   except certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that did not yet exist 
ppl energy supply adopted sfas as of july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on ppl energy supply 
ppl energy supply adopted the final provisions of eitf during the fourth quarter of as such  ppl energy supply now reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in the net energy trading margins line on the statement of income 
non derivative contracts that met the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf  accounting for energy trading and risk management activities are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  unrealized gains and losses are not reflected in the financial statements 
prior periods were reclassified 
no cumulative effect adjustment was required upon adoption 
ppl energy supply has adopted the final provisions of eitf prospectively as of october  as a result of this adoption  non trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points 
a major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available 
see note to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption of eitf ppl energy supply s short term derivative contracts are recorded as price risk management assets and price risk management liabilities on the balance sheet 
long term derivative contracts are included in other noncurrent assets other and deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities other 
accounting designation energy contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting 
for energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative  the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine their accounting designation 
these designations are verified by ppl energy supply s risk control group on a daily basis 
the following is a summary of the guidelines that have been provided to the traders who are responsible for contract designation for derivative energy contracts due to the adoption of sfas any wholesale and retail contracts to sell or buy electricity and the related capacity that are expected to be delivered from ppl s generation or that are approved by the rmc to fulfill a strategic element of ppl s overall marketing strategy are considered normal 
these transactions are not recorded in the financial statements and have no earnings impact until delivery 
physical electricity only transactions can receive cash flow hedge treatment if all of the qualifications under sfas are met 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur 
physical electricity purchases that increase ppl energy supply s long position and any energy sale or purchase judged a market call are considered speculative  with unrealized gains or losses recorded immediately through earnings 
financial transactions  which can be settled in cash  cannot be considered normal because they do not require physical delivery 
these transactions receive cash flow hedge treatment if they lock in the price ppl energy supply will receive or pay for energy expected to be generated or purchased in the spot market 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions that receive cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur 
physical and financial transactions for gas and oil to meet fuel and retail requirements can receive cash flow hedge treatment if they lock in the price ppl energy supply will pay in the spot market 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur 
option contracts that do not meet the requirements of dig issue c  scope exceptions interpreting the normal purchases and normal sales exception as an election  do not receive hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through earnings 
in addition to energy related transactions  ppl energy supply enters into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations 
as with energy transactions  the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the transaction determine a contract s accounting designation  which is subsequently verified by ppl energy supply s risk control group on a daily basis 
the following is a summary of certain guidelines that have been provided to the treasury department  which is responsible for contract designation transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance are considered cash flow hedges 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income and are amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt 
transactions entered into to hedge fluctuations in the value of existing debt are considered fair value hedges with no earnings impact until the debt is terminated because the hedged debt is also marked to market 
transactions entered into to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations are considered net investment hedges 
to the extent that the derivatives are highly effective at hedging the value of the net investment  gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and will not be recorded in earnings until the investment is disposed of 
transactions which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market through earnings 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is one of ppl energy supply s most significant risks due to the level of investment that ppl energy supply maintains in its generation assets  coupled with the volatility of prices for energy and energy related products 
several factors influence price levels and volatilities 
these factors include  but are not limited to  seasonal changes in demand  weather conditions  available generating assets within regions  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  market liquidity  and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations 
to hedge the impact of market price fluctuations on ppl energy supply s energy related assets  liabilities and other contractual arrangements  ppl energyplus sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under ferc market based tariffs throughout the us and enters into financial exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
because of the generating assets ppl energy supply owns or controls  the majority of ppl energy supply s energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge accounting 
within ppl energy supply s hedge portfolio  the decision to enter into energy contracts hinges on the expected value of ppl energy supply s generation 
to address this risk  ppl energy supply takes a conservative approach in determining the number of mwhs that are available to be sold forward 
in this regard  ppl energy supply reduces the maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors planned maintenance  unplanned outages and economic conditions 
the potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit 
another reduction  representing the unplanned outage rate  is the amount of mwhs that historically are not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment breakage 
finally  the potential output of certain plants like peaking units are reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow them to economically run during all hours 
ppl energy supply s non trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts 
the net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute 
ppl energy supply analyzes historical on peak and off peak usage patterns  as well as spot prices and weather patterns  to determine a monthly level of a block of electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility 
on a forward basis  ppl energy supply reserves a block amount of generation for full requirements energy contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks 
anticipated usage patterns and peaks are affected by expected load growth  regional economic drivers and seasonality

the fair value of electricity positions recorded above use the midpoint of the bid ask spreads obtained through otc brokers 
on average  otc quotes for forwards and swaps of natural gas and power extend one and two years into the future 
the prices based on models and other valuation methods category includes the value of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point  or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or otc broker 
additionally  this category includes strip transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to monthly prices as appropriate 
because of ppl energy supply s efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets  ppl energy supply has open contractual positions 
if ppl energy supply were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy under its agreements  under certain circumstances it would be required to pay damages 
these damages would be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or energy and the contract price of the undelivered capacity or energy 
depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets  such damages could be significant 
extreme weather conditions  unplanned power plant outages  transmission disruptions  non performance by counterparties or their counterparties with which it has power contracts and other factors could affect ppl energy supply s ability to meet its firm capacity or energy obligations  or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and energy 
although ppl energy supply attempts to mitigate these risks  there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations  that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform  or that it will not experience counterparty non performance in the future 
as of december   ppl energy supply estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its non trading portfolio by approximately million  which is equal to the estimated decrease at december  however  the change in the value of the non trading portfolio would have been substantially offset by an increase in the value of the underlying commodity  the electricity generated  because these contracts serve to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity 
additionally  the value of ppl energy supply s unsold generation would be improved 
because ppl energy supply s electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position  the adverse movement in prices is usually an increase in prices 
conversely  because ppl energy supply s commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net purchase position  the adverse movement in prices is usually a decrease in prices 
if both of these scenarios happened  the implied margins for the unsold generation would increase 
ppl energy supply also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities 
as a result  ppl energy supply may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated 
the margins from these trading activities are shown in the statement of income as net energy trading margins

as of december   ppl energy supply estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by million compared to a decrease of million at december  in accordance with its marketing strategy  ppl energy supply does not completely hedge its generation output or fuel requirements 
ppl energy supply estimates that for its entire portfolio  including all generation and physical and financial energy positions  a adverse change in power prices across all geographic zones and time periods will decrease expected gross margins by about million 
similarly  a adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices will decrease gross margins by million 
interest rate risk ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations 
ppl manages interest rate risk for ppl energy supply by using financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio  adjusting the duration of its debt portfolio and locking in us treasury rates and interest rate spreads over treasuries in anticipation of future financing  when appropriate 
risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of ppl energy supply s debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   ppl energy supply s potential annual exposure to increased interest expense  based on a increase in interest rates was insignificant  compared to million at december  ppl energy supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio 
at december   ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was million  compared to million at december  ppl and ppl energy supply utilize various risk management instruments to reduce ppl energy supply s exposure to adverse interest rate movements for future anticipated financings 
while ppl energy supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments  they are designed such that any economic loss in value should be offset by interest rate savings at the time the future anticipated financing is completed 
at december   ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was million 
at december   ppl energy supply had not entered into any such instruments 
foreign currency risk ppl energy supply is exposed to foreign currency risk  primarily through investments in affiliates in latin america and europe 
in addition  ppl energy supply may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars 
ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures  including firm commitments  recognized assets or liabilities and net investments 
in addition  ppl enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk 
ppl holds contracts for the forward purchase of million euros to pay for certain equipment of ppl susquehanna in the estimated value of these forward purchases as of december nbsp   being the amount ppl would receive to terminate them  was million 
ppl executed forward sale transactions for pound  million to hedge a portion of its net investment in wpdh limited

ppl executed forward sale transactions for billion chilean pesos to hedge a portion of its net investment in its subsidiary that owns cge 
the estimated value of these agreements as of december  was million  being the amount ppl would pay to terminate the transactions 
to protect expected income in chilean pesos  ppl entered into average rate options for billion chilean pesos 
at december nbsp   the market value of these positions  representing the amount ppl would pay to terminate them  was insignificant 
wpdh limited executed cross currency swaps totaling billion to hedge the interest payments and value of its us dollar denominated bonds 
the estimated value of this position on december   being the amount ppl energy supply would pay to terminate them  including accrued interest  was million 
on the statement of income  gains and loses associated with hedges of interest payments are reflected in interest expense 
gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected in depreciation 
gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet until the investment is disposed 
nuclear decommissioning fund securities price risk in connection with certain nrc requirements  ppl susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the susquehanna station 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed rate  fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on ppl energy supply s balance sheet 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund susquehanna s decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs 
however  the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets  and the values of fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ppl susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement 
at december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates and a decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets  as compared to a million reduction at december  ppl electric s restructuring settlement agreement provides for the collection of authorized nuclear decommissioning costs through the ctc 
additionally  ppl electric is permitted to seek recovery from customers of up to of certain increases in these costs 
under the power supply agreements between ppl electric and ppl energyplus  these revenues are passed on to ppl energyplus 
similarly  these revenues are passed on to ppl susquehanna under a power supply agreement between ppl energyplus and ppl susquehanna 
these revenues are used to fund the trusts 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that ppl energy supply would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
ppl energy supply maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings criteria and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk 
however  ppl energy supply has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities  natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing and trading companies 
these concentrations of counterparties may impact ppl energy supply s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic  regulatory or other conditions 
as discussed above under contract valuation  ppl energy supply records certain non performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out of the money from the counterparty s standpoint will default in its performance  in which case ppl energy supply would have to sell into a lower priced market or purchase from a higher priced market 
these reserves are reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in price risk management assets on the balance sheet 
ppl energy supply also records reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries ppl energy supply has made but not yet billed 
these reserves are reflected in unbilled revenues on the balance sheet 
ppl energy supply has also established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the california iso for which ppl energy supply has not yet been paid  as well as a reserve related to ppl energy supply s exposure as a result of the enron bankruptcy  which are reflected in accounts receivable on the balance sheet

new accounting standards fin and fin r in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin clarifies that variable interest entities  as defined therein  that do not disperse risks among the parties involved should be consolidated by the entity that is determined to be the primary beneficiary 
fin also requires certain disclosures to be made by the primary beneficiary and by an enterprise that holds a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity but is not the primary beneficiary 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after january  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before february   fin was originally required to be adopted no later than the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  however  in october  the fasb issued fsp fin  effective date of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which delayed the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to interests held by public entities in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  until the end of the first interim period ending after december  in december  the fasb revised fin by issuing interpretation no 
revised december  which is known as fin r and replaces fin fin r does not change the general consolidation concepts of fin among other things  fin r again changes the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to certain entities  clarifies certain provisions of fin and provides additional scope exceptions for certain types of businesses 
for entities to which the provisions of fin have not been applied as of december   fin r provides that a public entity that is not a small business issuer should apply the provisions of fin or fin r as follows i fin r shall be applied to all entities no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  and ii fin or fin r should be applied to entities that are considered to be spes no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  as permitted by fin r  ppl energy supply adopted fin effective december  for entities created before february  that are considered to be spes 
this adoption resulted in the consolidation of the lessors under the operating leases for the sundance  university park and lower mt 
bethel generation facilities  as well as the deconsolidation of a wholly owned trust 
see below for further discussion 
also  as permitted by fin r  ppl energy supply deferred the application of fin for other entities and plans to adopt fin r for all entities on march  ppl energy supply is in the process of evaluating entities in which it holds a variable interest in accordance with fin r 
ppl energy supply is currently not aware of any variable interest entities that are not consolidated as of december  but which it will be required to consolidate in accordance with fin r effective march  as it continues to evaluate the impact of applying fin r  ppl energy supply may identify additional entities that it would need to consolidate 
additional entities consolidated the lessors under the operating leases for the sundance  university park and lower mt 
bethel generation facilities are variable interest entities that are considered to be spes 
ppl energy supply is the primary beneficiary of these entities 
consequently  ppl energy supply was required to consolidate the financial statements of the lessors effective december  upon initial consolidation  ppl energy supply recognized billion of additional assets and liabilities on its balance sheet and a charge of million  after tax  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the additional assets consist principally of the generation facilities  and the additional liabilities consist principally of the lease financing 
see note to the financial statements for a discussion of the leases 
entities deconsolidated effective december   ppl energy supply deconsolidated siuk capital trust i 
this trust is considered to be an spe and was deconsolidated because ppl energy supply is not the primary beneficiary of the trust under current interpretations of fin therefore  the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely company debentures amounting to million  which would have been recorded as a component of long term debt in in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  if the trust was consolidated  are not reflected in ppl energy supply s balance sheet at december  instead  the subordinated debt securities that support the trust preferred securities are reflected in long term debt with affiliate trust as of december  see below for further discussion 
siuk capital trust i holds subordinated debt securities of wpd llp 
as a result of deconsolidating the trust  the subordinated debt securities are no longer eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   million is reflected as long term debt with affiliate trust in ppl energy supply s balance sheet 
the effect on the balance sheet as a result of deconsolidating the trust was an increase in both total assets and total liabilities of million 
the increase in assets relates to the investment in the common securities of the trust  which is no longer eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in liabilities consists primarily of the difference between the carrying value of the preferred securities issued by the trust compared to the carrying value of the subordinated debt securities of wpd llp 
the deconsolidation of the trust did not impact the earnings of ppl energy supply 
see the statement of company obligated mandatorily redeemable securities contained in the financial statements for a discussion of the trust and its preferred securities  as well as the subordinated debt securities issued to the trust

application of critical accounting policies ppl energy supply s financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods  assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of ppl energy supply  and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements 
these accounting policies are also discussed in note to the financial statements 
ppl s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions regarding them  with its audit committee 
in addition  ppl s senior management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee

nbsp  nbsp  pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note to the financial statements  ppl energy supply subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement plans and participate in  and are allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension cost of the ppl retirement plan and the ppl postretirement benefit plan 
ppl and ppl energy supply follow the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the company will record currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting discount rates  ppl and ppl energy supply consider fixed income security yield rates 
at december   ppl and ppl energy supply decreased the discount rate for their domestic plans from to as a result of decreased fixed income security returns 
for its international plans  ppl energy supply decreased the discount rate for its international plans from to at december  in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl and ppl energy supply consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
at december   ppl and ppl energy supply s expected return on plan assets for their domestic pension plans remained at 
for its international plans  ppl energy supply maintained a weighted average of as the expected return on plan assets at december  in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl and ppl energy supply consider tax implications  past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl and ppl energy supply s rates of compensation increase remained at for their domestic plans 
for its international plans  ppl energy supply s rate of compensation increase remained at at december nbsp  in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl and ppl energy supply consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december   ppl and ppl energy supply s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on projected benefit obligations  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other comprehensive income oci 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and oci by a similar amount in the opposite direction

at december   ppl energy supply had been allocated million of prepaid postretirement benefit costs included in prepayments on the balance sheet 
in  ppl energy supply was allocated and recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement income credited to operating expenses of million 
this amount represents a million decrease versus the credit recognized during this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate at december  as a result of the decrease in the assumed discount rate at december   ppl energy supply was required to increase its recognized additional minimum pension liability 
recording the change in the additional minimum liability resulted in a million increase to the pension related charge to oci  net of taxes  translation adjustment and unrecognized prior service costs  with no effect on net income 
this charge increased the pension related balance in oci  which is a reduction to member s equity  to million at december nbsp  the charges to oci will reverse in future periods if the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation

nbsp  nbsp  asset impairment ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries review long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
assets subject to this review  for which impairments have been recorded in or prior years  include international equity investments  new generation assets  consolidated international energy projects and goodwill 
ppl energy supply performs impairment analyses for tangible long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for long lived assets to be held and used  sfas requires companies to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
in determining asset impairments  management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate the fair value of an investment 
fair value is developed through consideration of several valuation methods including comparison to market multiples  comparison to similar recent sales transactions  comparison to replacement cost and discounted cash flow 
discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash flow streams  applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present values of the cash flow streams  and then assessing the probability of the various cash flow scenarios 
the impairment is then recorded based on the excess of the carrying value of the investment over fair value 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
during  ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries evaluated gas fired generation assets for impairment  as events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of these investments may not be recoverable 
ppl energy supply did not record an impairment of its new gas fired generation assets in for these impairment analyses  the most significant assumption was the estimate of future cash flows 
ppl energy supply estimates future cash flow using information from its corporate business plan adjusted for any recent sales or purchase commitments 
key factors that impact cash flows include projected prices for electricity and gas as well as firm sales and purchase commitments 
a decrease in estimated future cash flow for certain in service gas fired generation assets would have resulted in an impairment charge 
ppl energy supply performs impairment analyses of goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires an annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization 
ppl energy supply completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of this test did not result in an impairment 
ppl energy supply s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the determination of fair value 
ppl energy supply determined fair value based upon discounted cash flows 
a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of or an increase of the discount rate by basis points would not have resulted in impairment 
nbsp  nbsp  leasing ppl energy supply applies the provisions of sfas  accounting for leases  to all leasing transactions 
in addition  ppl energy supply applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and the eitf that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing arrangements 
in general  there are two types of leases from a lessee s perspective operating leases leases accounted for off balance sheet  and capital leases leases capitalized on the balance sheet 
in accounting for leases  management makes various assumptions  including the discount rate  the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated useful life  in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or capital 
changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease  thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition to uncertainty inherent in management s assumptions  leasing transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when they involve sale leaseback accounting leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased assets  synthetic leases leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes  and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets 
at december   ppl energy supply subsidiaries participated in one significant sale leaseback transaction which has been accounted for as an operating lease 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the lessors under certain synthetic operating leases previously accounted for off balance sheet were consolidated effective december  as a result of the adoption of fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 for certain entities 
sale leaseback in july  ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four year operating leases 
this transaction is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with current rules related to sale leaseback arrangements 
if for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements for off balance sheet operating lease treatment as a sale leaseback  ppl energy supply would have approximately million of additional assets and liabilities recorded on its balance sheet at december  and would have recorded additional expenses currently estimated at million  after tax  in see note to the financial statements for additional information related to operating leases 
nbsp  nbsp  loss contingencies ppl energy supply periodically records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl energy supply s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
the accrual of a loss contingency involves considerable judgment on the part of management 
the accounting aspects of loss contingencies include the initial identification and recording of the loss contingency  the determination of a triggering event for reducing a recorded loss contingency  and the on going assessment as to whether a recorded loss contingency is reasonable 
initial identification and recording of the loss contingency ppl energy supply uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
ppl energy supply continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl energy supply has identified certain events which could give rise to a loss  but which do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of potential loss contingencies  most of which have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas reducing recorded loss contingencies when a loss contingency is recorded  ppl energy supply identifies  where applicable  the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss contingency 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events which provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss contingencies certain loss contingencies are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the recorded liability for above market nug purchase commitments  which is described below 
this loss contingency is being reduced over the lives of the nug purchase contracts 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted 
environmental loss contingencies are reduced when ppl energy supply makes payments for environmental remediation 
on going assessment of recorded loss contingencies ppl energy supply reviews its loss contingencies on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are reasonable 
this involves on going communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  managers in various operational areas and other parties 
all three aspects of accounting for loss contingencies the initial identification and recording of a probable loss  the identification of triggering events to reduce the loss contingency  and the ongoing assessment of the reasonableness of a recorded loss contingency require significant judgment by ppl energy supply s management 
the largest loss contingency on ppl energy supply s balance sheet  and the loss contingency that changed most significantly in  was for above market nug purchase commitments 
this loss contingency reflects the estimated difference between the above market contract terms under the purchase commitments  and the fair value of electricity 
this loss contingency was originally recorded at million in  when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
under regulatory accounting  ppl electric recorded the above market cost of the purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as incurred basis  since these costs were recovered in regulated rates 
when the generation business was deregulated  the loss contingency associated with the commitment to make above market nug purchases was recorded 
this loss contingency for the above market portion of nug purchase commitments was recorded because it was probable that the loss had been incurred and the estimate of future energy prices could be reasonably determined  using the then forward prices of electricity and capacity 
this loss contingency was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july  corporate realignment 
the above market loss contingency was million at december  when the loss contingency related to nug purchases was recorded in  ppl electric established the triggering events for when the loss contingency would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the lives of the nug contracts 
all but one of the nug contracts expire by  with the last one ending in ppl energyplus reduces the above market nug liability based on the aforementioned schedule 
as ppl energyplus reduces the liability for the above market nug purchases  it offsets the actual cost of nug purchases  thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in line with market prices 
ppl energyplus assessed the remaining million above market liability at december   comparing the projected electricity purchases under the terms of the nug contracts  with the purchases assuming projected market prices for the energy 
this assessment was based on projected pjm market prices  including capacity  through the assessment also used sensitivities around the market prices  adjusting such prices upwards and downwards by 
the assessment is dependent on the market prices of energy and the estimated output levels of the nugs 
market prices of energy are dependent on many variables  including growth in electricity demand in pjm  available generation  and changes in regulatory and economic conditions 
accordingly  market price sensitivities were used in the assessment 
if estimated market prices were adjusted upwards by in each of the years from through  the contingency for the above market nug purchase commitments would be approximately million 
conversely  if estimated market prices were adjusted downwards by during the remaining term of the nug contracts  the contingency for the above market nug purchase commitments would be approximately million 
the recorded above market liability of million at december  falls within the range calculated in the year end assessment 
as noted above  it is very difficult to estimate future electricity prices  which are dependent on many variables and subject to significant volatility 
however  ppl energy supply s management believes that the current recorded nug above market liability was fairly stated at december  nbsp  nbsp  asset retirement obligations in  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized as a liability in the financial statements 
the initial obligation should be measured at the estimated fair value 
an equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
until the obligation is settled  the liability should be increased  through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement  for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in determining asset retirement obligations  management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value 
fair value is developed through consideration of estimated retirement costs in today s dollars  inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the asset retirement obligation was incurred 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of asset retirement obligations could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
ppl energy supply adopted sfas effective january  initial adoption of the new rules resulted in an increase in net pp amp  e of million  reversal of previously recorded liabilities of million  recognition of asset retirement obligations of million  recognition of a deferred tax liability of million and a cumulative effect of adoption that increased net income by million 
at december   ppl energy supply had asset retirement obligations totaling million recorded on the balance sheet 
ppl energy supply s most significant assumptions surrounding asset retirement obligations are the forecasted retirement cost  discount rate and inflation rate 
a variance in the forecasted retirement cost  discount rate or inflation rate could have a significant impact on the aro liability and the cumulative effect gain 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in these assumptions upon initial adoption 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption only

ppl electric utilities corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ppl electric provides electricity delivery service in eastern and central pennsylvania 
its headquarters are in allentown  pennsylvania 
see item  business background  for a description of ppl electric s business 
ppl electric s strategy and principal challenge is to own and operate its electricity delivery business at the highest level of quality and reliability and at the most efficient cost 
ppl electric s electricity delivery business is rate regulated 
accordingly  ppl electric is subject to regulatory risks in terms of the costs that it may recover and the investment returns that it may collect in customers rates 
an important challenge for ppl electric is to maintain a strong credit profile 
in the past few years  investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry have been particularly focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of these companies 
ppl electric is focused on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is to provide information concerning ppl electric s past and expected future performance in implementing the strategy and challenges outlined above 
specifically results of operations provides an overview of ppl electric s operating results in  and  starting with a review of earnings 
the earnings review identifies certain unusual items that had impacts in these years  and it also references the delivery rate increase that ppl electric expects to file with the puc in the spring of results of operations also includes an explanation of changes during this three year period in significant income statement components  such as operating revenues  operation and maintenance expenses  financing costs  income taxes and cumulative effects of accounting changes 
financial condition liquidity provides an analysis of ppl electric s liquidity position and credit profile  including its sources of cash including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow and uses of cash including contractual commitments and capital expenditure requirements and the key risks and uncertainties that impact ppl electric s past and future liquidity position and financial condition

the increase in sales volume was due in part to colder winter weather in the first quarter of  and higher plr revenues due to higher energy and capacity rates in compared with  partially offset by lower sales to ppl generation 
ppl generation s power plants began self supplying their station use in april  rather than taking supply from ppl electric 
the increase in operating revenues from retail electric operations from compared with was primarily due to higher revenues from providing electric generation supply as a plr 
since december  about to of kwh load in ppl electric s service territory that had been served by alternate suppliers under the customer choice act had returned to ppl electric as the supplier 
wholesale electric ppl electric wholesale revenues are derived from sales to municipalities 
the million decrease in wholesale electric revenues in compared with was due to the expiration of certain municipal contracts in february wholesale electric to affiliate ppl electric has a contract to sell to ppl energyplus the electricity that ppl electric purchases under contracts with nugs 
the termination of one nug contract in april and another in february caused ppl electric to purchase million less nug energy in compared to and million less in compared with ppl electric therefore had less electricity to sell to ppl energyplus 
energy purchases effective january   ppl electric began incurring the costs of certain ancillary services  such as area regulation and operating reserves  in connection with its power supply contract with ppl energyplus 
energy purchases increased by million in compared with  including million in ancillary service costs 
these costs were primarily offset by a million decrease in nug purchases due to the termination of an energy purchase contract with a nug in february energy purchases from affiliate energy purchases from affiliate increased by million in compared with this increase reflects higher prices for energy purchased under the power supply contracts with ppl energyplus needed to support plr load 
energy purchases from affiliate increased by million in compared with this increase reflects higher purchases under power supply contracts with ppl energyplus needed to support a higher plr load  due to the return of customers to ppl electric as their plr

although financial markets have improved and ppl domestic pension plans have experienced significant asset gains in  interest rates on fixed income obligations have continued to fall requiring a further reduction in the discount rate assumption as of december  the reduction in the discount rate assumption has a significant impact on the measurement of plan obligations and net pension cost  which will result in the allocation of a pension charge to ppl electric in see note to the financial statements for details of the funded status of ppl s pension plans 
depreciation depreciation increased by million in compared with  primarily due to plant and software additions  including the automated meter reading project 
taxes  other than income taxes  other than income  increased by million in compared with due to the settlement of prior years capital stock tax refund claims of million in  and higher taxes related to an increase in the basis on which capital stock tax is calculated in taxes  other than income  increased by million in compared with  primarily due to a million increase in gross receipts tax  partially offset by a million decrease in capital stock tax

this increase was partially offset by the settlement of prior years capital stock tax refund claims and a lower capital stock tax rate in workforce reduction see note to the financial statements for information on the charges recorded in and other income net see note to the financial statements for details of other income and deductions 
financing costs interest expense on long term debt decreased by million in compared to this decrease was the net impact of retirements of mortgage bonds  pollution control bonds and transition bonds  partially offset by the issuance of million of senior secured bonds and million of pollution control bonds 
lower interest on long term debt accounted for the million decrease in interest expense in compared with this decrease was the net impact of retirements of mortgage bonds and transition bonds  partially offset by the issuance of million of senior secured bonds in august dividends on preferred securities decreased by million from to and by million from to these decreases were due to retirements and redemptions of preferred securities and preferred stock

financial condition liquidity ppl electric is focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position and strengthening its balance sheet  thereby improving its credit profile 
ppl electric believes that its cash on hand  operating cash flows  access to debt capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken as a whole  provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing operating requirements  future security maturities and estimated future capital expenditures 
ppl electric currently expects cash on hand at the end of to be approximately million  with about million in syndicated credit facilities and up to million in short term debt capacity related to an asset backed commercial paper program in which it plans to participate starting in early however  ppl electric s cash flows from operations and its access to cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  the following unusual or extreme weather that may damage ppl electric s transmission and distribution facilities or effect energy sales to customers  ability to recover  and timeliness and adequacy of recovery of costs associated with regulated utility businesses  and a downgrade in ppl electric s credit ratings that could negatively affect its ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining credit facilities and any new debt 
at december   ppl electric had million in cash and cash equivalents and no short term debt as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term debt at december   and million in cash and cash equivalents and no short term debt at december  the changes in short term debt resulted primarily from the repayments described below under net cash provided by used in financing activities and in note to the financial statements 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulted from the following nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by operating activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by used in investing activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash used in financing activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  increase decrease in cash amp  cash equivalents nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by  or million  in versus  reflecting working capital improvements resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable 
the savings from a workforce reduction program that was commenced in was more than offset by rising transmission and distribution operating costs 
an important element supporting the stability of ppl electric s cash from operations is its long term energy purchase contracts with ppl energyplus 
these contracts provide sufficient energy for ppl electric to meet its plr obligation from through  at the pre determined capped rates it is entitled to charge its customers during this period 
these contracts require cash collateral or other credit enhancement  or reductions or terminations of a portion or the entire contract through cash settlement in the event of a downgrade of ppl electric or adverse changes in market prices 
for example  if ppl electric s ratings were lowered to below investment grade and energy prices decreased by  ppl electric estimates that  based on its december  and positions  it would have to post collateral of approximately million for both years 
the maximum that ppl electric would have to post under these contracts is million 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to million in the decrease was primarily the result of lower earnings and an increase in accounts receivable 
cash provided by operating activities was lower in  despite a million up front payment on the plr contract made in net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities in of million 
the difference primarily was the result of a lower loan repayment by an affiliate 
the primary use of cash for investing activities is capital and investment expenditures  which are summarized by category in the table in capital expenditure requirements 
in  ppl electric expects to be able to fund all of its capital expenditures with cash from operations 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million  as compared to net cash used in investing activities in of million 
the difference primarily was the result of a loan repayment by an affiliate in  versus net lending to affiliates in net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in  which reflects the repayment of long term debt 
in  the million of cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of million  preferred stock retirements of million  a contribution from parent of million and common and preferred dividends paid of million

in july  ppl electric determined that  based on its current cash position and anticipated cash flows  it would not need to access the commercial paper markets through at least the end of as a result  ppl electric requested standard amp  poor s ratings services s amp  p  moody s investors service  inc moody s and fitch ratings fitch to withdraw their ratings for its currently inactive commercial paper program  which the rating agencies did effective as of july nbsp  this decision has not limited the ability of ppl electric to fund its short term liquidity needs 
ppl electric currently does not have any commercial paper outstanding  but it expects to restart its commercial paper program in early at december   ppl electric s total committed borrowing capacity and the use of this borrowing capacity were as follows nbsp  nbsp  committed capacity nbsp  nbsp  borrowed nbsp  nbsp  letters of credit issued b nbsp  nbsp  available capacity b nbsp  ppl electric credit facilities a nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  a nbsp  ppl electric s credit facilities allow for borrowings at libor based rates plus a spread  depending upon the company s public debt rating 
ppl electric also has the capability to issue up to million of letters of credit under these facilities  which issuance reduces available borrowing capacity 
these credit facilities contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not greater than 
at december  and  ppl electric s consolidated debt to total capitalization percentages  as calculated in accordance with its credit facilities  were and 
ppl electric s day credit facility also allows it to borrow up to the full amount of the credit facility on the day of expiration for up to a one year period 
the credit agreements also contain certain representations and warranties that must be made for ppl electric to borrow under them  including  but not limited to  a material adverse change clause that relates solely to ppl electric s ability to perform its obligations under the credit agreements and related loan documents 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  b nbsp  ppl electric has a reimbursement obligation to the extent any letters of credit are drawn upon 
the letters of credit issued as of december  expire in these credit agreements contain various other covenants 
failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of due dates of borrowings and or termination of the agreements 
ppl electric monitors the covenants on a regular basis 
at december   ppl electric was in compliance with those covenants 
at this time ppl electric believes that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources 
ppl electric intends to reduce its total syndicated credit facilities to million in the first quarter of in early  ppl electric also intends to participate in an asset backed commercial paper abcp program for up to million that would be secured by a portion of its accounts receivable 
the abcp program would provide a more reliable and stable source of liquidity than an unsecured commercial paper program 
ppl electric s senior secured bond indenture restricts dividend payments in the event that ppl electric fails to meet interest coverage ratios or fails to comply with certain separateness formalities undertaken in connection with its strategic initiative see note to the financial statements for additional information 
ppl electric does not  at this time  expect that any of such limitations would significantly impact its ability to declare dividends

operating leases ppl electric has operating lease agreements to finance vehicles  personal computers and other equipment 
these leasing structures provide ppl electric with additional operating and financing flexibility 
the operating leases contain covenants that are standard for these types of arrangements  such as maintaining insurance  maintaining corporate existence and the timely payment of rent and other fees 
failure to meet these covenants could limit or restrict access to these leases or require early payment of obligations 
at this time  ppl electric believes that these covenants will not limit access to these leases or cause acceleration or termination of the leases 
see note to the financial statements for a further discussion of the operating leases

application of critical accounting policies ppl electric s financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods  assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of ppl electric  and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements 
these accounting policies are also discussed in note to the financial statements 
ppl s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions regarding them  with its audit committee 
in addition  ppl s senior management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
nbsp  nbsp  pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note to the financial statements  ppl electric participates in  and is allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension cost of the ppl retirement plan and the ppl postretirement benefit plan 
ppl follows the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the company will record currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting discount rates  ppl considers fixed income security yield rates 
at december   ppl decreased the discount rate for its domestic plans from to as a result of decreased fixed income security returns 
in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
at december   ppl s expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans remained at 
in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl considered past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl s rate of compensation increase remained at for its domestic plans 
in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl considers tax implications  past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december   ppl s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost allocated to ppl electric 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  ppl and its actuaries expect that the inverse of this change would impact the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost by a similar amount in the opposite direction 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption

at december   ppl electric had been allocated prepaid postretirement benefit costs totaling million  included in prepayments on the balance sheet 
in  ppl electric was allocated net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged to operating expense of million 
this amount represents a million reduction in the credit recognized during this reduction was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate at december  refer to note to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits 
nbsp  nbsp  loss contingencies ppl electric periodically records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl electric s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
the accrual of a loss contingency involves considerable judgment on the part of management 
the accounting aspects of loss contingencies include the initial identification and recording of the loss contingency  the determination of a triggering event for reducing a recorded loss contingency  and the on going assessment as to whether a recorded loss contingency is reasonable 
initial identification and recording of the loss contingency ppl electric uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
ppl electric continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl electric has identified certain events which could give rise to a loss  but which do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of potential loss contingencies  most of which have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas nbsp  reducing recorded loss contingencies when a loss contingency is recorded  ppl electric identifies the triggering event for subsequently reducing the loss contingency 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events which provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss contingencies certain loss contingencies are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the recorded liability for above market nug purchase commitments  which is described below 
this loss contingency was being reduced over the lives of the nug purchase contracts  prior to the transfer of this loss contingency to ppl energyplus 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted 
environmental loss contingencies are reduced when ppl electric makes payments for environmental remediation 
on going assessment of recorded loss contingencies ppl electric reviews its loss contingencies on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are reasonable 
this involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  managers in various operational areas and other parties 
all three aspects of accounting for loss contingencies the initial identification and recording of a probable loss  the identification of triggering events to reduce the loss contingency  and the ongoing assessment of the reasonableness of a recorded loss contingency require significant judgment by ppl electric s management 
the largest contingency currently on ppl s balance sheet is the loss contingency for above market nug purchase commitments  being the difference between the above market contract terms and the fair value of electricity 
this loss contingency was originally recorded at million in  when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
under regulatory accounting  ppl electric recorded the above market cost of the purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as incurred basis  since these costs were recovered in regulated rates 
when the generation business was deregulated  the loss contingency associated with the commitment to make above market nug purchases was recorded 
this loss contingency for the above market portion of nug purchase commitments was recorded because it was probable that the loss had been incurred and the estimate of future energy prices could be reasonably determined  using the then forward prices of electricity and capacity information 
this loss contingency was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july  corporate realignment 
when the loss contingency related to nug purchases was recorded in  ppl electric established the triggering events for when the loss contingency would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the lives of the nug contracts 
all but one of the nug contracts expire by  with the last one ending in prior to the july  transfer  ppl electric reduced the above market nug liability based on the aforementioned schedule 
as ppl electric reduced the liability for the above market nug purchases  it offset the actual cost of nug purchases  thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in line with market prices

ppl montana  llc and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of ppl montana is abbreviated as ppl montana meets the conditions set forth in general instruction i a and b of form k 
such analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements in item terms and abbreviations appearing here are explained in the glossary 
results of operations the following discussion explains significant changes in principal items on the statement of income comparing to the statement of income reflects the results of past operations and is not intended as any indication of future operating results 
future operating results will necessarily be affected by various and diverse factors and developments 
earnings net income increased by million in compared with the increase was primarily due to higher wholesale prices in the western u 
s and an increase in generation 
operating revenues operating revenues increased by million in compared with the increase was primarily due to an increase in wholesale energy prices of million and an increase in volume sold of million 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by million in compared with operating expenses consist mainly of expenses for fuel  energy purchases  transmission tariffs  plant operations and maintenance  lease rental payments  and general and administrative expenses 
the increase was primarily due to higher energy purchases of million  related to the higher power costs in the western us and higher volumes of million 
generation increased by million kwh during compared with this increase was primarily the result of improved operational performance from the coal fired generation units

risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other market risk background market risk is the potential loss ppl montana may incur as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument 
ppl montana is exposed to market risk from commodity price risk for energy and energy related products associated with the sale of electricity  the purchase of fuel for the generating assets  and energy trading activities 
ppl montana has a risk management policy approved by ppl s board of directors to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk 
credit risk is discussed below 
the rmc  comprised of senior management and chaired by the vice president risk management  oversees the risk management function 
key risk control activities designed to monitor compliance with risk policies and detailed programs include  but are not limited to  credit review and approval  validation of transactions and market prices  verification of risk and transaction limits  sensitivity analyses  and daily portfolio reporting  including open positions  mark to market valuations  and other risk measurement metrics 
in addition  efforts are ongoing to develop systems to improve the timeliness  quality and breadth of market and credit risk information 
the forward looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to reliance on model assumptions 
actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
contract valuation ppl montana utilizes forward contracts  options and swaps as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price volatility 
when available  quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial instrument 
this may include exchange prices  the average mid point bid ask spreads obtained from brokers  or an independent valuation by an external source  such as a bank 
however  market prices for energy or energy related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity 
if no active trading market exists  contracts are valued using internally developed models  which are then reviewed by an independent  internal group 
although ppl montana believes that its valuation methods are reasonable  changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values and realization in future periods 
to record derivatives at their fair value  ppl montana discounts the forward values using libor 
additionally  ppl montana reduces derivative assets carrying value to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality and potential illiquidity in the market 
the credit adjustment takes into account the probability of default  as calculated by an independent service  for each counterparty that has an out of the money position with ppl montana 
the liquidity adjustment takes into account the fact that it may not be appropriate to value contracts at the midpoint of the bid ask spread 
ppl montana might have to accept the bid price if ppl montana wanted to close an open sales position or ppl montana might have to accept the ask price if ppl montana wanted to close an open purchase position 
accounting and reporting ppl montana follows the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instrument and hedging activities  interpreted by dig issues together  sfas  eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  and eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
 to account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability unless they meet sfas s criteria for exclusion and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  which amends and clarifies sfas to improve financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are accounted for similarly  sfas clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
additionally  sfas placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or normal sale exception 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june   except certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that did not yet exist 
ppl montana adopted sfas as of july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on ppl montana 
ppl montana adopted the final provisions of eitf during the fourth quarter of as such  ppl montana now reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in the net energy trading margins line on the statement of income 
non derivative contracts that met the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf  accounting for energy trading and risk management activities are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  unrealized gains and losses are not reflected in the financial statements 
prior periods were reclassified 
no cumulative effect adjustment was required upon adoption 
ppl montana has adopted the final provisions of eitf prospectively as of october  as a result of this adoption  non trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points 
a major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available 
see note to the financial statements for the impact of adopting eitf ppl montana s short term derivative contracts are recorded as price risk management assets and price risk management liabilities on the balance sheet 
long term derivative contracts are included in noncurrent assets other and noncurrent liabilities other 
accounting designation energy contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting 
for energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative  the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine their accounting designation 
these designations are verified by ppl montana s risk control group on a daily basis 
the following is a summary of the guidelines that have been provided to the traders who are responsible for contract designation for derivative energy contracts due to the adoption of sfas any wholesale and retail contracts to sell or buy electricity and the related capacity that are expected to be delivered from ppl montana s generation or that are approved by the rmc to fulfill a strategic element of ppl montana s overall marketing strategy are considered normal 
these transactions are not recorded in the financial statements and have no earnings impact until delivery 
physical electricity only transactions can receive cash flow hedge treatment if all of the qualifications under sfas are met 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur 
physical electricity purchases that increase ppl montana s long position and any energy sale or purchase judged a market call are considered speculative  with unrealized gains or losses recorded immediately through earnings 
financial transactions  which can be settled in cash  cannot be considered normal because they do not require physical delivery 
these transactions receive cash flow hedge treatment if they lock in the price ppl montana will receive or pay for energy expected to be generated or purchased in the spot market 
any unrealized gains or losses on transactions that receive cash flow hedge treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur 
option contracts that do not meet the requirements of dig issue c  scope exceptions interpreting the normal purchases and normal sales exception as an election  do not receive hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through earnings 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is one of ppl montana s most significant risks due to the level of investment that ppl montana maintains in its generation assets  coupled with the volatility of prices for energy and energy related products 
several factors influence price levels and volatilities 
these factors include  but are not limited to  seasonal changes in demand  weather conditions  available generating assets within regions  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  market liquidity  and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations 
to hedge the impact of market price fluctuations on ppl montana s energy related assets  liabilities and other contractual arrangements  ppl energyplus sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under ferc market based tariffs throughout the us and enters into financial exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
because of the generating assets ppl montana owns or controls  the majority of ppl montana s energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge accounting 
within ppl montana s hedge portfolio  the decision to enter into energy contracts hinges on the expected value of ppl montana s generation 
to address this risk  ppl montana takes a conservative approach in determining the number of mwhs that are available to be sold forward 
in this regard  ppl montana reduces the maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors planned maintenance  unplanned outages and economic conditions 
the potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit 
another reduction  representing the unplanned outage rate  is the amount of mwhs that historically are not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment breakage 
finally  the potential output of certain plants like peaking units are reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow them to economically run during all hours 
at times  ppl montana s non trading portfolio includes full requirements energy contracts 
the obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute 
ppl montana analyzes historical on peak and off peak usage patterns  as well as spot prices and weather patterns  to determine a monthly level of block electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility 
on a forward basis  ppl montana reserves a block amount of generation for full requirements energy contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks 
anticipated usage patterns and peaks are affected by expected load growth  regional economic drivers and seasonality 
ppl montana s commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment mature at various times through the following chart sets forth ppl montana s net fair market value of these contracts as of december  nbsp  nbsp  gains fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year nbsp  nbsp  contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year nbsp  nbsp  fair value of new contracts at inception nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  other changes in fair values nbsp  nbsp  fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the year nbsp  nbsp  during  ppl montana realized or otherwise settled net losses of approximately million related to contracts entered into prior to january  this amount does not reflect intra quarter contracts that were entered into and settled during the period

the fair values of electricity positions recorded above use the midpoint of the bid ask spreads obtained through otc brokers 
on average  otc quotes for forwards and swaps of natural gas and power extend one and two years into the future 
the prices based on models and other valuation methods category includes the value of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point  or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or otc broker 
additionally  this category includes strip transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to monthly prices as appropriate 
because of ppl montana s efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets  ppl montana has open contractual positions 
if ppl montana were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy under its agreements  under certain circumstances it would be required to pay damages 
these damages would be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or energy and the contract price of the undelivered capacity or energy 
depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets  such damages could be significant 
extreme weather conditions  unplanned power plant outages  transmission disruptions  non performance by counterparties or their counterparties with which it has power contracts and other factors could affect ppl montana s ability to meet its firm capacity or energy obligations  or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and energy 
although ppl montana attempts to mitigate these risks  there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations  that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform  or that it will not experience counterparty non performance in the future 
as of december   ppl montana estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its non trading portfolio by approximately million  as compared to a decrease of million at december  however  the change in the value of the non trading portfolio would have been substantially offset by an increase in the value of the underlying commodity  the electricity generated  because these contracts serve to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity 
additionally  the value of ppl montana s unsold generation would be improved 
because ppl montana s electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position  the adverse movement in prices is usually an increase in prices 
ppl montana also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities 
as a result  ppl montana may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated 
the margins from these trading activities are shown in the statement of income as net energy trading margins 
ppl montana s trading contracts mature at various times through ppl montana s net fair market value of trading contracts as of december  and was insignificant 
as of december   the net loss on ppl montana s trading activities expected to be recognized in earnings during the next three months is insignificant 
ppl montana estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by an insignificant amount at december  and interest rate risk ppl montana may use borrowings to provide funds for its operations 
ppl and ppl energy supply may utilize various financial derivative products and risk management techniques on behalf of ppl montana to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in ppl montana s debt portfolio and thereby reduce its exposure to adverse interest rate movements 
ppl montana had no borrowings outstanding as of december nbsp  credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that ppl montana would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
ppl montana maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings criteria and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk 
however  ppl montana has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities and other energy marketing and trading companies 
these concentrations of counterparties may impact ppl montana s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic  regulatory or other conditions 
as discussed above under contract valuation  ppl montana records certain non performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out of the money from the counterparty s standpoint will default in its performance  in which case ppl montana would have to sell into a lower priced market or purchase from a higher priced market 
these reserves are reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in price risk management assets on the balance sheet 
ppl montana also records reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries ppl montana has made but not yet billed 
these reserves are reflected in unbilled revenues on the balance sheet 
ppl montana has also established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the california iso for which ppl montana has not yet been paid

application of critical accounting policies ppl montana s financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods  assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of ppl montana  and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements 
these accounting policies are also discussed in note to the financial statements 
ppl s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions regarding them  with its audit committee 
in addition  ppl s senior management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
nbsp  nbsp  price risk management see risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other above 
nbsp  nbsp  pension and other postretirement benefits ppl montana follows the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the company will record currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting discount rates  ppl montana considers fixed income security yield rates 
at december   ppl montana decreased the discount rate from to as a result of decreased fixed income security returns 
in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl montana considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
at december   ppl montana s expected return on plan assets remained at 
in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl montana considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl montana s rate of compensation increase remained at 
in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl montana considers tax implications  past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december   ppl montana s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumption listed above could have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other comprehensive income oci 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligations and pre tax oci charge by million and would have an insignificant impact on the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities excluding additional minimum liability and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost 
a basis point increase in the health care cost trend rate would increase the projected benefit obligations by million and would have an insignificant impact on the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost 
a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets or rate of compensation increase would have an insignificant impact on the projected benefit obligations  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and oci 
while the information above reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would have a similar impact in the opposite direction 
each sensitivity above reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
at december   ppl montana had recognized accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities of million  included in noncurrent liabilities other on the balance sheet 
ppl montana s total projected obligation for these benefits was approximately million  but was offset by million of assets held in a pension trust 
in  ppl montana recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged to operating expenses of million  excluding amounts credited to construction and other non expense accounts 
this amount is comparable to the expense recognized during during  ppl montana made contributions to its pension plan totaling million 
as a result  ppl montana was able to decrease its recognized additional minimum pension liability 
recording the reduction in the additional minimum pension liability resulted in a decrease to the pension related charge to oci  net of taxes  of million 
this adjustment decreased the pension related balance in oci  which is a reduction to member s equity  to million at december  the charges to oci will reverse in future periods if the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation 
refer to note to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits 
nbsp  nbsp  leasing ppl montana applies the provisions of sfas  accounting for leases  to all leasing transactions 
in addition  ppl montana applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and the eitf that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing arrangements 
in general  there are two types of leases from a lessee s perspective operating leases leases accounted for off balance sheet and capital leases leases capitalized on the balance sheet 
in accounting for leases  management makes various assumptions  including the discount rate  the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated useful life  in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or capital 
changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease  thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition to uncertainty inherent in management s assumptions  leasing transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when they involve sale leaseback accounting leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased assets  synthetic leases leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets 
at december   ppl montana subsidiaries participated in one significant sale leaseback transaction 
this transaction has been accounted for as an operating lease 
sale leaseback in july  ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four year operating leases 
this transaction is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with current rules related to sale leaseback arrangements 
if for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements for off balance sheet operating lease treatment as a sale leaseback  ppl montana would have approximately million of additional assets and liabilities recorded on its balance sheet at december  and would have recorded additional expenses currently estimated at million  after tax  in see note to the financial statements for additional information related to operating leases 
nbsp  nbsp  loss contingencies ppl montana periodically records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl montana s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
the accrual of a loss contingency involves considerable judgment on the part of management 
the accounting aspects of loss contingencies include the initial identification and recording of the loss contingency  the determination of a triggering event for reducing a recorded loss contingency  and the on going assessment as to whether a recorded loss contingency is reasonable 
initial identification and recording of the loss contingency ppl montana uses its internal expertise  and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
ppl montana continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl montana has identified certain events which could give rise to a loss  but which do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of potential loss contingencies  most of which have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas nbsp  reducing recorded loss contingencies when a loss contingency is recorded  ppl montana identifies the triggering event for subsequently reducing the loss contingency 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred or the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events which provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss contingencies certain loss contingencies are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the recorded liability for above market purchase contracts  as described below 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted 
environmental loss contingencies are reduced when ppl montana makes payments for environmental remediation 
on going assessment of recorded loss contingencies ppl montana reviews its loss contingencies on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are reasonable 
this involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  managers in various operational areas and other parties 
all three aspects of accounting for loss contingencies the initial identification and recording of a probable loss  the identification of triggering events to reduce the loss contingency  and the ongoing assessment of the reasonableness of a recorded loss contingency require significant judgment by ppl montana s management 
the largest contingency currently on ppl montana s balance sheet is the loss contingency for the above market purchase contract being the difference between the out of market contract terms and the fair value of the energy 
this loss contingency was originally recorded at million in  when ppl montana purchased the assets of montana power and assumed the contract 
under purchase accounting  ppl montana recorded the out of market cost of the purchase contract 
this loss contingency for the out of market contract was recorded because it was probable that the loss had been incurred and the loss could be reasonably estimated  using forward pricing information 
the out of market loss contingency was million at december  when the loss contingency related to the contract was recorded in  ppl montana established the triggering events for when the loss contingency would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the life of the contract which expires in the liability is being reduced over the agreement terms as an adjustment to energy purchases on the statement of income 
ppl montana assessed the remaining million out of market liability at december   comparing the energy purchases under the terms of the contract  with the purchases assuming market prices for the energy 
market prices for the contract were derived by using internal forward energy price curves 
the forward energy price curves in this scenario were based on the revenue and sales information for through  as comprehended in the current business plan of ppl montana 
the assessment also used sensitivities around the forward energy prices  adjusting such prices upwards and downwards by 
the assessment was dependent on forward energy prices and the projected purchase levels of the contract 
the forward prices of energy are dependent on many variables  including growth in electricity demand  available generation  and general economic conditions 
changes in these and other factors can have a dramatic impact on future electricity prices 
accordingly  forward energy price sensitivities were used in the assessment 
if estimated forward market prices were adjusted upwards by in each of the years from through  the contract would have an estimated liability of million 
conversely  if estimated forward market prices were adjusted downwards by during the remaining term of the contract  the contract would have an estimated liability of million 
the recorded contingency of million falls within the range calculated in the year end assessment 
as noted above  it is very difficult to estimate future electricity prices  which are dependent on many variables and subject to significant volatility 
ppl montana s management believes that the current recorded liability was fairly stated at december  in connection with the december bankruptcy filings by enron corporation and its affiliates collectively enron  ppl montana terminated certain electricity  gas and other trading agreements with enron 
at the time that these trading agreements were terminated  they were at prices more favorable to ppl montana than current market prices  and ppl montana established a reserve for uncollectible accounts of million 
in october  ppl montana filed proofs of claim in enron s bankruptcy proceedings for million 
these claims were against enron north america and enron power marketing the enron subsidiaries  and against enron corporation  which had guaranteed the enron subsidiaries performance the enron corporation guarantees 
during  ppl montana and enron engaged in discussions regarding the amount of claims that would be allowed against the enron subsidiaries 
although no formal agreement on such amounts has been reached  based on informal discussions with enron s counsel  ppl montana believes that its claims against the enron subsidiaries will eventually be allowed in the bankruptcy at approximately million 
accordingly  ppl montana reduced its receivables from enron  and the associated reserve for uncollectible accounts  by million 
ppl montana also determined that it is probable that it will recover approximately million of these receivables from the enron subsidiaries  and may collect additional amounts under the enron corporation guarantees 
therefore  ppl montana determined that it was appropriate to reduce its reserve by an additional million 
ppl montana will continue to reassess the reserve for uncollectible accounts associated with its receivables from enron
