we disclaim any obligation to update or revise the forward looking statements contained herein  except as otherwise required by applicable federal securities laws 
cablevision systems corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary our future performance is dependent  to a large extent  on general economic conditions including capital market characteristics  the effectiveness of direct competition  our ability to manage our businesses effectively  and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace  both with suppliers and customers 
telecommunications in our telecommunications segment we derive revenues principally through monthly payments by subscribers to our cable television systems 
these monthly payments include charges for cable television  as well as  in many cases  equipment rental  pay per view charges  high speed internet access and charges for telephone service 
revenue increases are derived from increases in the number of subscribers to our cable television systems  increases in the number and changes in the type of programming and services sold to our existing subscribers  and price increases 
we also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available to cable television systems 
revenues from advertising vary based upon the number and demographics of our subscribers who view the programming carried on our cable television systems 
by far the most serious challenge we face in our provision of cable television services  which accounted for of our revenues in  comes from competition from the direct broadcast satellite business 
there are two major providers of dbs service in the united states  each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have 
this size allows the dbs providers certain advantages  especially in the pricing they pay for programming 
in addition  the cable television operators like the company must pay local franchises up to of our revenues as a fee for operating in the municipalities we serve 
direct broadcast satellite providers do not pay these fees 
the combination of these two factors may lead to retail pricing advantages for the dbs providers 
recent subscriber decreases in the cable business  reversing the historical trend of consistent annual increases in penetration  most likely reflect these pricing advantages  as well as the fact that our penetration rate is now averaging approximately in most areas  which limits our ability to add new subscribers 
we intend to counter these advantages by bundling our service offerings with products that the dbs companies cannot efficiently provide at this time  such as high speed internet access and internet protocol telephone service carried over the cable distribution plant  as well as by providing on demand services that are currently unavailable to a dbs subscriber 
our high speed internet access business  which accounted for of our revenues in  faces competition from dsl providers 
these providers have become increasingly aggressive in their pricing strategies in recent years  and customers may decide that a reduced price is more important to them than the superior speed that cable modems provide 
also  the telephone companies may find technological or other solutions to upgrade their service offering  providing additional competition for our service offering 
in addition  with of our basic subscribers now subscribing to our high speed internet service  opportunities to expand that base at the current pace may be limited 
the recent gains in cable modem penetration may therefore not be indicative of the results we achieve in the future 
our consumer voice over internet protocol telephone offering  which is in its initial rollout stage  is competitive with incumbent offerings primarily on the basis of pricing  where unlimited continental long distance  regional and local calling  together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra  are offered at one low price 
to the extent the incumbents  who have financial resources that exceed those of the company  decide to meet our pricing or reduce their pricing and features  strategies  future growth and success of this business may be impaired 
lightpath  our commercial telephone and broadband business  operates in the most competitive business telecommunication market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunication companies both incumbent local exchange companies  other competitive local exchange companies and long distance companies 
to the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices  future success of the company may be impaired 
business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless  data medium 
should the pace of this shift accelerate dramatically  future growth of the company may be impaired 
rainbow in our rainbow segment  which accounted for of our revenues  we earn revenues in two principal ways 
first  we receive payments from operators of cable television systems and satellite services 
these revenues are earned under multi year affiliation agreements with those companies 
the specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks 
the second principal source of revenues in this segment is from advertising 
under our agreements with cable and satellite operators we have the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programs 
our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees 
this is because most of our advertising is sold on a short term basis  not under long term contracts 
also our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming which is tracked by rating services 
we seek to grow our revenues in the rainbow segment by increasing the number of cable systems and satellite providers that carry our services and the number of subscribers to cable systems and satellite services that receive our programming 
we refer to this as our penetration 
amc  which is widely distributed  has less ability to increase its penetration than newer  less penetrated services 
cable operators and satellite providers are increasingly interested in obtaining financial payments in return for carrying new services 
these payments take the form of marketing support or direct payments for carriage 
we seek to increase our advertising revenues through intensified marketing but  ultimately  the level of our advertising revenues are directly related to the penetration of our services and the popularity including within desirable demographic groups of our services 
the principal goals for us in this segment are to increase the penetration of our national services and our advertising revenues 
to do this we must continue to contract for and produce high quality  attractive programming 
our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television operators and satellite providers 
this increased concentration increases the power of those operators and providers and could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration 
in addition  this concentration gives those operators and providers greater leverage in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements 
moreover  as a result of this concentration the impact from a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships becomes more severe 
in december  regional programming partners completed the acquisition of the interests in fox sports net bay area and fox sports net chicago that it did not already own in a transaction that was accounted for as a purchase 
as a result  as of december   we have begun to consolidate the results of fox sports net bay area and fox sports net chicago 
the consolidation will increase the revenues and expenses in our rainbow segment  although the amount of revenues that the rainbow segment will receive from fox sports net chicago are likely to decline in later periods as a result of the loss of the professional sports team rights in the chicago area 
madison square garden madison square garden  which accounted for of our revenues  consists of professional sports teams principally the new york knicks of the nba and the new york rangers of the nhl  the msg network sports programming business  and an entertainment business  which operates the madison square garden arena  radio city music hall  the hartford civic center and rentschler field  faces competitive challenges unique to these activities 
we derive revenues in this segment primarily from the sale of tickets  including luxury box rentals  to sporting and entertainment events and from rental rights fees paid to this segment by promoters that present events at madison square garden and radio city music hall 
we also derive revenue from the sale of advertising at the entertainment venues  from food  beverage and merchandise sales at the venues and from the licensing of our trademarks 
msg network derives its revenues from affiliate fees paid by cable television and satellite providers  sales of advertising  and from rights fees paid to this segment by broadcasters tv and radio and programming services that telecast events of sports teams which are under contract with msg network 
msg network carries knicks and ranger games  so that  like the rest of this segment  its performance is related to the performance of the teams 
all of these revenues are ultimately dependent upon the quality of our sporting and entertainment events 
our sports teams financial success is dependent on their ability to generate advertising sales  paid attendance  luxury box rentals  and food and merchandise sales 
to a large extent  the ability of the team to build excitement among fans and therefore produce higher revenue streams  depends on the teams winning performance  which generates regular season and playoff attendance  and which supports increases in prices charged for tickets  luxury box rentals  and advertising placement 
each of the team s success is dependent on the company s ability to acquire highly competitive players 
although players are most often highly compensated  future successful performance is not certain 
the governing bodies of the national basketball association nba and the national hockey league nhl have the power and authority to take certain actions that they deem to be in the best interest of their respective sports  which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing msg s results of operations 
our sports programming business success is affected by our ability to secure desired programming of a variety of professional sports teams in addition to our proprietary programs 
the success of the teams that are telecast by us will impact our revenues from distribution and from the rates charged for affiliation and advertising 
our entertainment business is largely dependent on the continued success of our radio city christmas spectacular and our touring christmas shows  as well as availability of  and our venues ability to attract  concerts  family shows and events 
rainbow dbs rainbow dbs launched its voom sm service on october  it has not yet produced any revenues 
as described under rainbow dbs under item business  through february  this business had  activated customers 
all of these accounts are part of a free preview service period which  in most cases  is scheduled to end on march  the principal challenge for this business is to attract a sufficient subscriber base to reach and exceed a break even point and to do so with subscriber acquisition and other costs that are within its funding capabilities 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
critical accounting policies in preparing its financial statements  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following restructuring charges in  the company recorded a charge to income representing the cost of restructuring its operations 
the costs included in the charge principally consisted of employee termination costs  such as severance pay and outplacement services  and provisions for lease termination costs  including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period  estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances 
in  the company announced a new operating plan and restructuring which included the closing of retail electronics store locations  the elimination of certain staff positions  the reduction of capital expenditures and the disposition of its motion picture theater business 
additionally  in connection with the new operating plan  the company reached an agreement with its supplier of set top boxes which reduced the company s purchase commitments for set top boxes from million in  million in  and million in to a total remaining commitment of million in and nothing thereafter and required the company to make certain other cash payments aggregating million plus interest on a portion of such amount with respect to  among other things  a license for certain software valued at million based on an independent appraisal 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded restructuring charges  which included employee termination costs  such as severance pay and outplacement services costs  and provisions for lease termination costs including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period  estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances and other related costs and the cost associated with the reduction in required digital set top box commitments 
in  the company eliminated certain staff positions primarily at madison square garden and in the telecommunications segment and incurred severance costs aggregating approximately million 
costs related to employee terminations are estimated on an individual by individual basis  giving effect to the announced severance plan 
costs for lease terminations are projected in consultation with real estate professionals 
actual lease termination costs may differ from these estimates as a result of changes in market conditions 
because these costs are based on estimates and projections  they can prove to be inaccurate 
changes in estimates  as the plan is implemented and additional facts are gathered  are reflected in current operations as adjustments to the restructuring charges  separately reported and identified 
impairment of long lived and indefinite lived assets the company s long lived assets at december  include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill of approximately billion  approximately billion of other intangible assets and approximately billion of property  plant and equipment 
such assets accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated total assets 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and was required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
statement requires that goodwill impairment be determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for other long lived assets  including intangibles that are amortized  the company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment 
if the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets  the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
if these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an impairment loss of million representing the balance of goodwill related to certain theaters of clearview cinemas 
in  the company recorded an impairment loss of million representing the write down of software and leasehold improvements relating to the company s retail electronics business reported in discontinued operations 
in december  the company recorded an impairment loss of million  included in technical and operating expense  representing the write off of certain film and programming contracts of the company s rainbow segment 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the company s historical net operating losses 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences 
if such estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
in  the company s income tax expense reflected a reduction in the valuation allowance related to its net deferred tax assets of million 
in  the income tax benefit of the company reflects an increase in the valuation allowance of million 
at the end of the second quarter of  nbc exchanged part of its interest in rainbow media holdings for shares of the company s common stock 
as a result of this exchange  rainbow media holdings became a member of the consolidated federal income tax return of the company 
the exchange was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the valuation allowance was reduced to zero  resulting in a reduction to the recorded goodwill  without any income statement benefit 
in  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards 
plant and equipment costs incurred in the construction of the company s cable television system  including line extensions to  and rebuild of  the company s hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and costs incurred in the construction of the company s head end facilities are capitalized 
these costs consist of materials  sub contractor labor  direct consulting fees  and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of company employees and the portion of facility costs  including rent  taxes  insurance and utilities  that supports the construction activities 
infrastructure costs are depreciated over the year estimated life of the plant  and head end facilities are depreciated over the estimated life of the specific component  ranging from years for certain electronics to years for tower sites 
costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities  including repairs and maintenance and call completion fees  are expensed as incurred 
in addition  the costs of connecting businesses or residences that have never before been connected to the service offering are capitalized 
these costs include material  subcontractor and internal labor and related costs as discussed above 
in addition  on site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized 
the departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics  and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity 
new connections are amortized over years or years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home  respectively 
the portion of departmental costs related to reconnection  programming service up and down grade  repair and maintenance  and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred 
certain of these capitalized costs are based on estimates of activity levels and other historical statistics 
these estimates are evaluated at least semi annually  and any changes that result  which may be significant  are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which the evaluations are performed

refer to cablevision s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above 
liquidity and capital resources overview cablevision has no operations independent of its subsidiaries  no borrowings and no public securities outstanding other than our cablevision ny group class a and cablevision ny group class b common stock 
funding for our subsidiaries is generally obtained through separate financial arrangements made available to the restricted group as later defined and to our rainbow and madison square garden business segments 
the restricted group  which includes csc holdings and its subsidiaries which conduct our cable television and high speed internet access operations  as well as our commercial telephone and modem operations throughout the new york metropolitan area  is our principal borrower 
we have historically raised funds through the issuance of public securities  including senior and subordinated debt and preferred stock issuances of csc holdings  as well as through borrowings under a bank credit facility 
during  the restricted group funded the requirements of the telecommunications services segment  rainbow dbs  and certain other general corporate requirements 
effective january   we reorganized the funding of certain of our businesses in light of the announcement of our intention to spin off rainbow dbs  three of rainbow s national programming networks and certain other businesses see recent events below 
as a result  in  the restricted group is expected to fund i requirements of the telecommunications services segment  ii requirements  if any  of certain rainbow media holdings programming businesses that are expected to remain with cablevision upon completion of the spin off primarily our fuse subsidiary  our regional news operations  and the regional programming partners subsidiaries  and iii certain other general corporate requirements 
the restricted group is also expected to fund certain rainbow dbs expenditures planned for  but not funded  during the restricted group may also from time to time  make other investments as permitted under its credit facility 
rainbow media holdings  which comprises the company s programming operations  is currently funded through cash from operations and borrowings under an million credit facility made available to rainbow media holdings 
madison square garden s funding requirements are primarily provided through cash from operations and were provided as well by borrowings under a million credit facility 
in march  borrowings under the msg credit facility were repaid in full and the credit facility was terminated with proceeds from an intercompany loan from regional programming partners

consideration for the purchase  which totaled million for the interest in fox sports bay area and million for the interest in fox sports chicago  was paid by the issuance of million and million promissory notes to fox sports networks 
the notes were issued by subsidiaries of regional programming partners and secured solely by regional programming partners interest in fox sports net bay area 
both of the notes bear interest at the prime rate plus and mature in december the results of operations of fox sports bay area and fox sports chicago have been consolidated with our results of operations as of the acquisition date and the full amount of both promissory notes are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
planned spin off of satellite service and three rainbow media national entertainment services in october  we announced that our board of directors had approved an amended plan to spin off our recently launched satellite service  rainbow dbs  along with three of rainbow media holdings national entertainment services amc  the independent film channel and we women s entertainment  their subsidiaries  and certain other rainbow businesses 
completion of the spin off is subject to a number of conditions  including the refinancing of the existing rainbow media holdings credit facility which is expected to provide funding for the dbs business as well as refinance all then existing rainbow media holdings indebtedness  receipt of a tax ruling from the internal revenue service irs  and the filing and effectiveness of a form with the securities and exchange commission 
we have received a tax ruling from the irs and expect to file the form in the second quarter of we expect to complete the spin off after the form is declared effective 
in anticipation of the spin off  on december   we distributed million in cash on hand from amc and the independent film channel to csc holdings  and beginning january   we reorganized the funding of certain businesses to reflect the proposed spin off structure 
quadrangle exercise of put option in october  quadrangle capital partners lp exercised its right to require csc holdings to purchase all of its series a exchangeable participating preferred stock 
terms of the agreement provide for the delivery of cash or registered equity securities of cablevision in settlement of the put right 
we are currently in discussions with quadrangle as to the process for determining the put price  which is expected to exceed million  and following that determination will determine the form and timing of the payment of the put price 
repurchase of mgm s interest in rainbow media national services in july  we repurchased mgm s interest in each of amc  the independent film channel and we women s entertainment for an aggregate purchase price of million  comprised of million in cash paid at closing and a million promissory note issued by cablevision systems corporation that matured in december and was repaid with proceeds from a new term loan at rainbow media holdings 
the purchase was initially effected by certain unrestricted subsidiaries of csc holdings with advances from amc and rainbow media holdings from cash and available bank borrowings  however  in december  the interests were contributed by the csc holdings subsidiaries to rainbow media holdings in connection with the closing of the new term loan and repayment of the promissory note see rainbow media holdings section for a discussion of the new term loan and related activity 
northcoast communications in may  northcoast communications completed its sale of pcs licenses to verizon wireless for approximately million in cash 
of the proceeds  approximately million was used by northcoast communications to retire debt 
the remaining proceeds  after payment of expenses  were distributed to the partners of northcoast communications  including the company  which owns a interest in northcoast communications 
the company s share of the proceeds was approximately million  of which million is being held in an escrow fund to provide for any post closing adjustments and any potential indemnification claims 
all of the funds the company received were used to repay bank debt under the restricted group credit facility 
monetization of general electric common stock in january  rainbow media holdings monetized the value of the general electric common stock received in connection with the sale of the bravo programming service through the execution of prepaid forward contracts  collateralized by an equivalent amount of the underlying general electric stock 
these contracts set a floor and cap on the company s participation in the changes in the underlying stock price and at maturity are expected to offset declines in the fair value of the general electric stock below the hedge price per share  while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the cap price 
at maturity  the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of general electric stock  with a value determined by reference to the stock price at maturity 
cash proceeds of million received in the transactions were distributed to csc holdings and were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the restricted group s credit facility 
these contracts are obligations of certain unrestricted subsidiaries of rainbow media holdings  however  csc holdings provided a guarantee of the subsidiaries ongoing interest expense obligations and any early termination obligations 
the amount of the guarantees is capped at million in the aggregate 
monetization of leapfrog common stock in april  we monetized  shares of leapfrog common stock  acquired through an investment in convertible preferred stock of leapfrog made in march  through a prepaid forward contract  collateralized by an equivalent amount of the underlying stock 
the contract sets a floor and cap on our participation in the changes in the underlying stock price and at maturity is expected to offset declines in the fair value of leapfrog stock below the hedge price per share  while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the cap price 
at maturity  the contract provides for the option to deliver cash or shares of leapfrog stock  with a value determined by reference to the stock price at maturity 
cash proceeds  net of prepaid interest  of million were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the restricted group s credit facility 
the monetization contract is an obligation of an unrestricted subsidiary of csc holdings 
restricted group as of december   our restricted group consisted of csc holdings and all of its subsidiaries holding our cable and digital cable operations  which encompassed approximately million and million subscribers  respectively  our consumer high speed internet access operations  which encompassed approximately million subscribers  and the commercial telephone and high speed internet access operations of lightpath throughout the new york metropolitan area 
the restricted group s primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations  its bank credit facility and its access to the capital markets as evidenced by csc holdings outstanding senior and senior subordinated debt and preferred stock issuances and proceeds from asset sales 
in addition  during  the restricted group received cash distributions of million from rainbow media holdings million of which was used to repay the million promissory note issued to mgm comprised of million received in march  million received in december in connection with the spin off plan  million of which was distributed temporarily from proceeds of the new rainbow media holdings term loan in december and is expected to be contributed to rainbow dbs during to fund a portion of its cash requirements 
currently  the restricted group has a billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks 
borrowings under the facility are guaranteed by certain of the restricted group subsidiaries 
the facility matures on june   requires no interim commitment reductions  and permits maximum leverage of times cash flow as defined in the credit agreement through march  and times cash flow through march  the leverage ratio as defined was times as of december  as of march   the restricted group had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of  million and outstanding letters of credit of million  resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of million 
the revolver contains several financial covenants  including debt to cash flow  cash flow to interest expense  and cash flow to debt service expense all as defined in the credit agreement  as well as restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds  that may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder 
the restricted group has also issued senior public and senior subordinated public indentures  which also contain financial and other covenants  though they are generally less restrictive than the covenants contained in the restricted group s credit facility 
there are no covenants  events of default  borrowing conditions or other terms in the restricted group s credit facility or in any of csc holdings other debt or preferred stock securities that are based on downgrades to our credit ratings by any rating agency 
the restricted group s capital requirements associated with the roll out of its new services such as digital video and voice over internet protocol  as well as the start up losses associated with the new voice over internet protocol product  and certain other corporate expenses  create a net funding requirement 
in addition  the restricted group is expected to fund the balance of the approved  unspent investment of million in rainbow dbs in  totaling approximately million 
we currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the restricted group  including the investment in rainbow dbs  as well as an estimated amount for the series a exchangeable participating preferred stock redemption  to the extent we elect to settle in cash  will be met with borrowings under the restricted group s existing bank credit facility and that the restricted group s available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet these requirements for the next twelve months 
any significant additional investments of the restricted group may require additional funding 
cablevision s and csc holdings future access to the public debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings  which are provided by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
in july  moody s placed csc holdings credit ratings on negative outlook and standard poor s placed csc holdings credit ratings on credit watch with negative implications 
in october  both agencies reaffirmed the ratings and the outlooks for csc holdings 
any downgrade to the csc holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds 
rainbow media holdings financing for rainbow media holdings has historically been provided by a combination of cash flow from operations  bank credit facilities  intercompany borrowings  sales of interests in programming entities  and  from time to time  by equity contributions from partners 
in december  we combined the million rainbow media holdings and the million amc the independent film channel we credit facilities into one facility at rainbow media holdings and refinanced and increased the term loan component of the credit facility by million 
million of the proceeds of the new facility were distributed to cablevision and used to repay the outstanding promissory note issued to mgm as consideration for the interest in amc  the independent film channel  and we acquired in july upon receipt of the distribution  the interests in such channels held outside of rainbow media holdings were contributed to rainbow media holdings 
million of the proceeds were temporarily distributed to csc holdings  however  the full balance is expected to be contributed to rainbow dbs during to cover its funding requirements 
the balance of the loan proceeds were used to reduce outstanding bank debt under rainbow media holdings revolver 
the amended rainbow media holdings credit facility is an million credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan maturing march  and march   respectively 
the facility is secured primarily by the assets of and guaranteed by amc  the independent film channel  and we 
rainbow media holdings interest in the stock of these entities is also pledged as collateral 
the term loan requires quarterly amortization beginning december  through and revolver commitment reductions begin in june principal covenants include maximum senior leverage of times cash flow as defined  based on the combined cash flows of amc  the independent film channel and we through june   reducing to times cash flow through september  and times cash flow through march  and maximum total leverage of times cash flow through september   reducing to times thereafter through march  as of december   the senior and total leverage ratios were times cash flow 
as of march   rainbow media holdings had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of million and outstanding letters of credit of million  resulting in undrawn commitments of million 
rainbow media holdings credit facility contains several financial covenants  including debt to cash flow  cash flow to interest expense  and cash flow to debt service expense all as defined in the credit agreement  as well as restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds  that may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder 
the facility also limits the amount of investment in rainbow dbs  csc holdings and cablevision 
there are no covenants  events of default  borrowing conditions or other terms based upon downgrades to our credit ratings by any rating agency in rainbow media holdings credit facility 
on november   the company announced it would restate its previously reported financial statements for the first and second quarters of and that as a result of such restatement it would seek a waiver of any potential default or event of default under its rainbow media holdings and previously existing amc the independent film channel we credit facilities 
that waiver was obtained from bank lenders in november currently the amc  the independent film channel and we partnerships generate net free cash flow  however  certain developmental activities undertaken by rainbow media holdings  such as the mag rack service and other video on demand programming and content services being developed  require funding 
such funding may be obtained through cash generated from other rainbow media holdings operations or through borrowings under the rainbow media holdings credit facility 
we believe we have sufficient availability from cash from operations and committed credit facilities to fund rainbow media holdings cash requirements for the next twelve months 
in addition  as discussed under recent events  as of january   we reorganized the funding of certain businesses in anticipation of our announced spin off plan and  as a result  rainbow media holdings is also expected to fund a portion of the requirements of rainbow dbs see rainbow dbs discussion below 
rainbow media holdings future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings  which are provided by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
in december  moody s eliminated the credit watch for potential downgrade status for the rainbow media holdings bank credit facility that it had initiated in october  however  both moody s and standard poor s maintain a negative outlook on the rating 
any downgrade to the rainbow media holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase rainbow media holdings interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds 
madison square garden madison square garden s primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations and its million revolving credit facility 
this facility was due to mature on december  in march  borrowings under the msg credit facility were repaid in full and the credit facility was terminated with proceeds from a million intercompany loan from regional programming partners 
madision square garden s funding requirements for the next twelve months will be met by its cash on hand and internally generated funds  intercompany loans from regional programming partners  and or new bank borrowings or loans from the partners of regional programming partners 
rainbow dbs rainbow dbs business is a start up venture with significant cash requirements and it has limited access to funding  given its early stage of operations 
funding needs for rainbow dbs operations in  which include capital investment except as noted below with respect to mvdds  start up losses  and funds required to develop its proprietary voom sm hd programming channels  are expected to total million 
of this amount  million is being provided by cablevision as an equity investment on or prior to the date of the spin off 
in addition  rainbow media holdings has the ability to borrow up to million under its credit agreement subject to covenant compliance and availability and use proceeds of those borrowings to make equity investments in rainbow dbs 
we believe that these investments will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements of rainbow dbs through the date of the spin off  assuming that it occurs on or prior to the end of the third quarter of rainbow media holdings has an million credit facility with million of undrawn commitments as of march  
of that amount  up to million may be drawn to fund the investments referred to above 
all of the borrowings under the rainbow media holdings credit facility will be required to be repaid prior to the date of the spin off 
we expect the funds necessary for that repayment to come from new debt issued by amc  ifc and we 
all of the then outstanding borrowings under the rainbow media holdings credit agreement referred to above would be required to be repaid from the new borrowings 
we anticipate that the remaining proceeds of the financings could  subject to certain limitations and financial covenants  be used by the borrowers to make investments in rainbow dbs 
the ability of amc  ifc and we to invest in rainbow dbs will be primarily subject to i compliance with a total debt to cash flow covenant  based on the cash flow of amc  ifc and we  and ii annual and cumulative investment basket limitations on the amounts available for distribution and investment 
the need to finance the development of the rainbow dbs business will limit the funding available to support the rainbow media national services businesses included in the spin off 
there can be no assurances as to the ability of the company  rainbow media holdings  amc  ifc or we to secure any of this new financing 
if sufficient financing cannot be raised prior to the spin off  the spin off will not occur 
the funding described above  if available to the full extent we currently expect  would provide funding to cover the anticipated cash requirements of rainbow dbs for the next twelve months 
rainbow dbs also has not identified a source of funding for the construction and launch of the five ka band satellites for which rainbow dbs has fcc authorization 
nor has rainbow dbs identified financing sources to replace funds used for the acquisition of the mvdds licenses  though rainbow dbs might seek such funding from the restricted group or other sources 
additionally  rainbow dbs has not identified financing sources for the build out of the infrastructure to exploit the mvdds licenses

see note of consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of this investment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices and interest rates 
our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the comcast  at t  charter communications  at t wireless  general electric  leapfrog enterprises and adelphia communications common stock held by us 
we have entered into prepaid forward contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities 
these contracts  at maturity  are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share  while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price 
the contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed 
the contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract  among other factors 
in the event of an early termination of any of these contracts  we would be obligated to repay the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and the fair value of the equity collar  calculated at the termination date 
the underlying stock and equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value 
as of december   the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of comcast  at t  charter communications  at t wireless  general electric  leapfrog and adelphia communications common stock aggregated  million 
assuming a change in price  the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately million 
as of december   the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of these securities aggregated million  a net receivable position 
the maturity  number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity  hedge price per share  and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via a prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table cap price security of shares deliverable hedge price per share maturity low high comcast at t charter communications at t wireless general electric adelphia communications leapfrog represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation 
also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts 
represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation 
our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  and other operational and investment requirements 
to manage interest rate risk  from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates 
such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment 
in addition  from time to time we may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
fair value of debt based on the level of interest rates prevailing at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock liabilities of  million exceeded their carrying value of  million by approximately million 
the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities 
our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current libor based market rates and thus approximate fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at december  would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock liabilities by approximately million to  million 
this estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities 
interest rate derivative contracts as of december   we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of million 
as of december   the fair market value and carrying value of these interest rate swap contracts was approximately million  a net liability position  as reflected under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point decrease in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would not change the fair value of these contracts as they are nearing maturity 
in addition  we had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of  million entered into in connection with our monetization transactions 
as of december   such contracts had a fair market value and carrying value of million  a net liability position  reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point increase in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would increase the fair market value of our liabilities under derivative contracts by approximately million to a liability of million
