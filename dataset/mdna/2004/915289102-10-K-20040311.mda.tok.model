k there are no credit rating triggers that would require pre payment 

table of contents contractual commitments the company has two credit facilities in place a million day credit agreement which is due to terminate on september  and a million credit agreement due to terminate on october  the agreements provide for the termination of the loan commitments and require the prepayment of all outstanding borrowings in the event that any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than percent of the then outstanding voting stock of unocal other than in a transaction having the approval of unocal s board of directors  at least a majority of which are continuing directors  or if continuing directors shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the board 
the agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
both agreements limit the company s debt to equity ratio to percent  with the company s convertible preferred securities included as equity in the ratio calculation 
the company also has a year million canadian dollar denominated non revolving credit facility with a variable rate of interest 
at december   the borrowings under the credit facility translated to million  using applicable foreign exchange rates 
the company also had in place a universal shelf registration statement as of december   with an unutilized balance of approximately billion for the future issuance of other debt and or equity securities depending on the company s needs and market conditions 
from time to time  the company may also look to fund some of its long term projects using other financing sources  including multilateral and bilateral agencies 
maintaining investment grade credit ratings  that is bbb baa and above from standard poor s ratings services and moody s investors service  inc  respectively  is a significant factor in the company s ability to raise short term and long term financing 
as a result of the company s current investment grade ratings  the company has access to both the commercial paper and bank loan markets 
the company currently has a bbb baa credit rating by standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
standard poor s and moody s have a stable rating outlook for the company s long term debt  prime and a commercial paper ratings 
the company does not believe it has a significant exposure to liquidity risk in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
in the normal course of business  the company has performance obligations that are secured  in whole or in part  by surety bonds or letters of credit 
these obligations primarily cover self insurance  site restoration  dismantlement and other programs where governmental organizations require such support 
these surety bonds and letters of credit are issued by financial institutions but are funded by the company if exercised 
the company has entered into indemnification obligations in favor of the providers of these surety bonds and letters of credit 
in addition  the company has various other outstanding guarantees

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements guarantees related to assets or obligations of third parties the company has guaranteed the debt of certain joint ventures accounted for by the equity method 
the majority of this debt matures ratably through the year extending guarantees to creditors allows the joint ventures to reduce their borrowing costs 
the company is not the primary beneficiary in any of these arrangements 
the maximum amount of future payments the company could be required to make is approximately million 
in addition to these guarantees  to facilitate sales of some property or as a condition of some property leases  the company indemnified certain third parties for particular remediation costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a more detailed discussion of guarantees related to assets or obligations of third parties 
these agreements are not critical to the company s liquidity  credit risk or capital resources 
sales of accounts receivables the company  through a bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary  unocal receivables corporation  has a sales agreement with an outside unrelated party that provides for the sale of up to million of an undivided interest in domestic crude oil and natural gas trade receivables 
the company uses this program as a low cost and readily available source of working capital 
details of this arrangement are provided in note to the company s financial statements 
in the event receivables become uncollectible  the outside purchaser would participate in any losses that exceed reserves built into the program 
the arrangement also has a credit rating trigger whereby the sales of receivables are prohibited if the company s long term unsecured debt should be rated less than bbb by standard poor s or baa by moody s 
in such an event  the purchaser would be repaid from its pro rata share of receivables as they are collected and the company may find it necessary to use an alternative source of funds 
in this case  the company s accounts receivable balance would increase as well as the balance of debt on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this program is not critical to the company s liquidity or capital resources 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and requires management to make difficult and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the following represents management s view of accounting policies  practices and estimates that are critical for the company 
oil and gas accounting the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for the accounting policy description for oil and gas exploration and development costs 
acquisition and development costs of proved properties are capitalized and each is amortized on a units of production basis over the remaining life of proved and proved developed reserves  respectively 
if reserve estimates are revised downward  earnings could be affected by higher prospective depreciation and depletion expense or an immediate write down of the property s book value see impairments discussion below 
if reserve estimates are revised upward  earnings could be affected by decreased prospective depreciation and depletion expense 
exploratory drilling involves significant capital investment and considerable risk of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
see risk factors in item of this report for a discussion on our drilling activities may not be productive 
exploratory wells that do not find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are expensed as dry hole expense 
dry holes take place at unscheduled times and involve interpretation based on technical expertise and informed judgment 
material fluctuations in earnings may result from the recording of dry hole expense 
at the time exploratory acreage is acquired  the company makes an initial assessment of the probability that the acreage will eventually lead to the discovery of commercial hydrocarbon reserves 
the portion estimated not to find commercial reserves is amortized 
the majority of properties have costs that are individually not significant and are amortized for impairment by groups 
additional attention is given to individually significant leases concessions to ensure their probability of success factors and amortization periods are consistent with the latest developments 
the methodology takes into consideration factors that indicate partial or full impairment 
oil and gas reserves estimates of physical quantities of oil and gas reserves are determined by company engineers and in some cases verified by third party experts 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
accordingly  these estimates do not include probable or possible reserves 
estimated oil and gas reserves are based on available reservoir data and are subject to future revision resulting from future changes in economic and operating conditions 
see risk factors in item of this report for a discussion on our oil and gas reserve estimates are subject to change 
significant portions of the company s undeveloped reserves  principally in offshore areas  require the installation or completion of related infrastructure facilities such as platforms  pipelines  and the drilling of development wells 
proved reserve quantities exclude royalty and other interests owned by others 
the company reports all reserves held under pscs utilizing the economic interest method  which excludes host country shares 
estimated quantities for pscs reported under the economic interest method are subject to fluctuations in the price of oil and gas and recoverable operating expenses and capital costs 
if costs remain stable  reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices 
this change would be partially offset by a change in the company s net equity share 

table of contents impairment of assets see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for the accounting policy description of impairment of assets 
commodity prices are difficult to predict and can change dramatically 
prices depend on market demand and supply  which can be influenced by factors such as opec production quotas  changes in climate conditions  government regulation  political instability  economic climates at both a local and a global basis  security and other factors 
different views of future commodity prices could have a significant impact on whether the company records asset impairments 
field decline rates  increases in lifting and development costs or a downward revision of reserves could occur and result in asset impairment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for details on impairments 
asset retirement obligations aros see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for the accounting policy description of asset retirement obligations 
see note for a discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
recognized aro liability amounts are based upon future asset retirement cost estimates that are developed in large part from abandonment cost studies performed by independent third party firms 
the studies are then reviewed by the company s technical  accounting and legal staff 
projecting future aro cost estimates is difficult as it involves the estimation of many variables such as economic recoveries of future oil and gas reserves  future labor and equipment rates  future inflation rates  and the company s credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
future geopolitical  regulatory  technological  contractual  legal and environmental changes could also impact future aro cost estimates 
because of the intrinsic uncertainties present when estimating asset retirement costs as well as asset retirement settlement dates  the company s aro estimates are subject to ongoing volatility 
post employment benefits the company utilizes us generally accepted accounting principles  as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board  to recognize the projected benefit obligations associated with pension and health care plans and for recording the costs of such plans in its income statement 
the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations pbo and related costs involves considerable judgment concerning events that are expected to occur over varying lengths of time in the future 
some of the key variables that impact measurement include future salary growth  estimated employee turnover rates and retirement dates  mortality  lump sum election rates  interest discount rates  initial and long term cost trend rates and retiree utilization rates for health care services 
due to the complex and specialized nature of these calculations  the company engages the services of outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these obligations and their related costs 
the recent decline in interest rates  to near year lows  and lower market returns on plan assets for years negatively impacted the company s benefit plans 
while no cash contributions have been required in recent years  the low interest rates and market returns have increased pension and other related retirement benefit expenses 
the company and its actuaries utilize both forecasted and historical data to adjust assumptions 
assumed interest discount rates reflect the rates at which pension benefits can be effectively settled 
the company has little leeway in selecting a discount rate as such rates are required to reflect rates implicit in current annuity contracts and or current market rates for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases both the present value of benefit obligations and pension expense 
for the company s us qualified plan  a basis point decrease in the discount rate  with all other assumptions held constant  would have increased the pbo by approximately million at december  and would increase pre tax pension expense for by approximately million 
for  the expected rate of return on plan assets roa is percent  which reflects the average rate of returns expected on funds invested to provide the projected benefits 
by definition the roa is an estimate of long term returns 
the company considers expected asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on all categories of plan assets when selecting an roa 
a basis point decrease in the expected return on the assets of the company s principal pension plans with all other assumptions held constant would increase pre tax pension expense approximately million in 
table of contents interest rates  asset returns and inflation have varied significantly over time and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
likewise  actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of changes in plan benefits and terms plus legal  economic and other factors 
in  the company recognized a minimum pension liability of million reflecting the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation abo over the fair value of plan assets at december   for its qualified retirement plan covering current and former us payroll employees 
the recognition of this liability resulted in an after tax charge of million to the other comprehensive income oci component of stockholders equity 
if in subsequent years returns on plan assets improve and or interest rates rise the fair value of plan assets may again exceed the abo 
if this occurs  the liability will be reversed and a pre paid pension cost asset will be re established on the balance sheet with the offsetting credit booked to oci 
in  the company made a million voluntary contribution to the plan and the plan experienced favorable asset returns 
as a result  the minimum pension liability was reduced by million to million  and the cumulative oci after tax charge decreased by million to million 
the company was not required to make any contributions to the plan in nor will it be required to make any contributions in or however  poor returns on plan assets could accelerate the requirement to make cash contributions to the plan after the company may elect  however  to make voluntary cash contributions to the plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional disclosures on the company s various post employment benefit plans 
environmental and litigation the company s management makes judgments and estimates pursuant to applicable accounting rules in recording costs and establishing reserves for environmental clean up and remediation and potential costs of litigation settlements 
for environmental reserves  actual costs can differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations  discovery and analysis of actual site conditions and or changes in clean up technology 
for additional details  refer to the ensuing environmental matters discussion and notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
actual litigation costs can vary from estimates based on the facts and circumstances and the application of laws in the individual cases 
environmental matters unocal is committed to operating its business in a manner that is environmentally responsible 
this commitment is fundamental to the company s core values 
as a part of this commitment  the company has procedures in place to audit and monitor its environmental performance 
in addition  unocal has implemented programs to identify and address environmental risks throughout the company 
consequently  the company continues to incur substantial capital and operating expenditures for environmental protection and to comply with federal  state and local laws  as well as foreign laws  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment and management of hazardous and other waste materials 
in many cases  investigatory or remedial work is now required at various sites even though past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under environmental laws and regulations  if any  existing at the time 
years ended december  millions of dollars estimated environmental related capital expenditures the capital expenditures were higher than due to environmental capital expenditures that were incurred in to prepare properties owned by the company for sale 
higher estimated capital expenditures are mainly attributed to various planned environmental projects related to process upgrades and expansion for ongoing operations  contractual requirements and regulatory compliance 

table of contents amounts recorded for environmental related expenses  including provisions for remediation that were identified during the company s ongoing review of its environmental obligations and operating  maintenance and administrative expenses  were approximately million in  million in and million in lower expenses in versus were primarily due to higher remediation provisions recorded in for service stations  bulk plants  terminals  refineries and pipelines that were part of the company s former west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets sold in and for the decommissioning and decontamination of the company s molycorp  inc molycorp subsidiary closed molybdenum and rare earth processing facilities in washington and york  pennsylvania 
partially offsetting the higher expenses were higher remediation provisions recorded in for the company s inactive guadalupe oil field located on the central california coast and for remediation projects at the company s former refinery in beaumont  texas 
lower expenses in versus were due partially to additional remediation provisions recorded in for the cleanup of service station sites  distribution facilities and central california oil and gas fields formerly operated by the company 
higher expenses were also due to additional provisions that were recorded for remediation liabilities related to agricultural chemical sites sold by the company in at december   the company s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled million  of which million was included in current liabilities 
during  cash payments of million were applied against the reserves and million in provisions were added to the reserves 
the company may also incur additional liabilities at sites where remediation liabilities are probable but future environmental costs are not presently reasonably estimable because the sites have not been assessed or the assessments have not advanced to stages where costs are reasonably estimable 
at those sites where investigations or feasibility studies have advanced to the stage of analyzing feasible alternative remedies and or ranges of costs  the company estimates that it could incur possible additional remediation costs aggregating approximately million 
the reserve amounts and possible additional costs are grouped into the following four categories at december  millions of dollars reserve possible additional costs superfund and similar sites active company facilities company facilities sold with retained liabilities and former company operated sites inactive or closed company facilities total also  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on environmental related matters 
during  provisions of million were recorded for the company facilities sold with retained liabilities and former company operated sites category 
these provisions included the estimated cleanup costs for oil fields located in michigan and california that were formerly operated by the company 
the estimated costs are based on assessments recently performed at the sites  higher than anticipated volumes of contaminated soil at existing sites and higher remediation costs for soil excavation and disposal than originally anticipated 
the provisions for this category of sites were also the result of revised remediation cost estimates that were identified during for service station sites and distribution facilities formerly operated by the company 

table of contents provisions were also recorded for auto truckstop sites that were sold by the company in in december  an agreement was reached with the owner of certain of these auto truckstops indemnifying the company from future remediation liabilities and obligations related to these sites in exchange for a cash payment and payment for insurance coverage for unforeseen future environmental exposure that may arise from contamination that existed prior to the original sale of the sites 
the agreement was finalized in january in addition  the company received revised remediation cost estimates from the purchaser of service stations  bulk plants  terminals  refineries and pipelines that were part of the company s former west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets sold in in  the company accrued million related to sites in the inactive or closed company facilities category primarily for the guadalupe oil field located on the central california coast and for remediation projects at the company s former refinery in beaumont  texas 
for the guadalupe oil field site  it was determined that contaminated soil excavated from the site will be taken to an offsite landfill for disposal 
the soil is contaminated with diluent  a kerosene like additive used in the field s former operations 
previously  the company had planned to remediate the soil on site  however  a preliminary draft report for the ecological risk study being conducted indicates that on site remediation is not feasible 
the provisions recorded for the site include the costs for the offsite disposal alternative 
the provisions recorded for the guadalupe oil field also include estimated costs for remediation work that is ongoing at the site 
this work includes groundwater monitoring  operation and maintenance of remedial systems  restoration  agency oversight  permitting  and site assessment 
the provisions for these costs are based on data from various studies and assessments that have been completed for the site in conjunction with data provided by the project management system the company has in place 
a provision was also recorded for the company s former beaumont  texas refinery 
the company has been working with the texas commission on environmental quality tceq to develop plans for closing impoundments used in the site s former operations and for other remediation projects 
in  the company recorded a provision for the revised estimated costs of the impoundment closure plan based on the tceq initial draft permit that was issued for the site 
the company recorded provisions of million during for the active company facilities category of sites 
the provisions were primarily for the remedial investigation and feasibility study ri fs being performed at a molybdenum mine located in questa  new mexico  that is owned by the company s molycorp subsidiary 
molycorp has been working closely with the us environmental protection agency and the state of new mexico in conducting the ri fs at the mine during the year 
the ri fs is being performed to determine if past mining operations have had an adverse impact on the environment 
numerous additions and changes to the ri fs scope have been required by the agencies  which will require a higher level of effort than originally projected 
in  estimated possible additional costs in excess of amounts included in the reserves for remediation obligations decreased by million 
the decrease was primarily for sites in the active company facilities category  as a result of the reclassification of costs to asset retirement obligations under sfas no 
for the company s molycorp subsidiary see note for further detail 
the decrease was also the result of the company lowering its estimated costs for the inactive or closed company facilities category of sites by million 
these costs were included in the amounts added to the reserve for the guadalupe oil field and the beaumont refinery sites as discussed above 
partially offsetting the foregoing decreases was an increase of million in possible additional costs for the superfund and similar sites category 
the increase is based on preliminary information that the company has received regarding possible payments for remediation related work for two sites located in california 

table of contents at year end  estimated possible additional costs for the company facilities sold with retained liabilities and former company operated sites category was million  no change from year end during  possible additional costs for this category of sites increased for former company operated service stations and distribution facilities 
the increase was based on revised cost estimates for remediation work that may be required for these sites 
possible additional costs also increased for a former oil field in michigan where the company is in the process of determining the extent of cleanup that may be required 
offsetting the aforementioned increases were lower remediation costs based on estimates received from the purchaser of service stations  bulk plants  terminals  refineries and pipelines that were part of the company s former west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets sold in during  possible additional costs for this category also increased as the result of higher costs identified for auto truckstop system sold by the company in these costs were subsequently added to the remediation reserve and the estimated possible additional costs were concurrently reduced as a result of the agreement reached with the owner of certain of these sites indemnifying the company from future remediation liabilities and obligations as previously discussed 
outlook realized prices for crude oil  natural gas liquids and north america natural gas are a significant driver of financial performance for the company

table of contents risk factors our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks  including those described below 
if any of such events should occur  our business  financial condition  liquidity and or results of operations could be materially harmed  and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments 
additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future 
our profitability is highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  which have historically been very volatile 
our revenues  profitability  operating cash flows and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
historically these prices have been very volatile 
a significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and cash flow and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and the amounts of our proved oil and gas reserves 
our commodity hedging and speculating activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to endeavor to protect ourselves from commodity price volatility  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
in addition  we engage in speculative trading in hydrocarbon commodities and derivative instruments in connection with our risk management activities  which subjects us to additional risk 
our drilling activities may not be productive 
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  marine risks such as capsizing  collisions and hurricanes  other adverse weather conditions  and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and  if unsuccessful  this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
while all drilling  whether developmental or exploratory  involves these risks  exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to higher risk exploratory projects  it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses 
as part of our strategy  we explore for oil and gas offshore  often in deep water or at deep drilling depths  where operations are more difficult and costly than on land or than at shallower depths and in shallower waters 
deepwater operations generally require a significant amount of time between a discovery and the time that we can produce and market the oil or gas  increasing both the operational and financial risks associated with these activities 

table of contents we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed 
our business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  leaks  spills  cratering and fire  as well as weather related risks  such as severe storms and hurricanes  any of which could result in damage to  or destruction of  oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property  some of which may be difficult and expensive to control and or remediate  as well as injuries and or deaths 
in addition  our pipeline  midstream and mining activities are subject to similar risks 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  we maintain insurance coverages  including certain physical damage  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
however  because of deductibles and other limitations  we are not fully insured against all risks in our business 
the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and possibly on our financial position 
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects 
we are involved in several large development projects  principally offshore 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of those projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  such as offshore platforms  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect the completion of and commencement of production from such projects and  consequently  the economic value of and returns on such projects 
our oil and gas reserve estimates are subject to change 
estimates of reserves by necessity are projections based on engineering and geoscience data  commodity prices  future rates of production and the amounts and timing of future expenditures 
our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and projected future net revenues require substantial judgment on the part of the petroleum engineers  particularly with respect to new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and revenues attributable to those reserves based on the same data 
future operating performance that deviates significantly from reserve reports and future changes in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects  as well as on the amounts and carrying values of such reserves 
fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas can have the effect of significantly altering reserve estimates  because the economic projections inherent in the estimates and the terms of production sharing contracts for our foreign operations may reduce or increase the quantities of recoverable reserves 
under our production sharing contracts  under which we receive shares of production to recover our costs  our entitlement share of reserves and production generally decreases as sales prices increase  and vice versa 
we may not realize the prices our reserve estimates reflect or produce the estimated volumes during the periods those estimates reflect 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any downward revision in our estimated quantities of reserves or of the carrying values of our reserves could have adverse consequences on our financial results  such as increased depreciation  depletion and amortization charges and or impairment charges  which would reduce earnings and stockholders equity 

table of contents if we fail to find or acquire additional reserves  our reserves and production will decline materially from their current levels 
the rate of production from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional productive zones or secondary recovery reserves  or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline materially as oil and gas are produced 
future oil and gas production is  therefore  highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
our growth may depend on our ability to acquire oil and gas properties on a profitable basis 
acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have been a key element of maintaining and growing our reserves and production in recent years  particularly in north america 
the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors  including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves  rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves and to assess future abandonment and possible future environmental liabilities 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets 
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
we are subject to domestic governmental risks that may impact our operations 
our domestic operations have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price controls and environmental protection laws and regulations 
global political and economic developments may impact our operations 
political and economic factors in international markets may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
on an equivalent barrel basis  over percent of our oil and gas production in was outside the united states  and over percent of our proved oil and gas reserves at december  were located outside of the united states 
all of our geothermal operations and reserves are located outside the united states 
there are many risks associated with operations in international markets  including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil  natural gas liquids  natural gas and geothermal steam pricing and taxation  other political  economic or diplomatic developments  changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations 
these risks include political and economic instability or war  the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation  confiscatory taxation  legal proceedings and claims arising from our foreign investments or operations  a foreign government attempting to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements  or failing to extend or renew such arrangements  fluctuating currency values and currency controls  and constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area 
actions of the united states government through tax and other legislation  executive order and commercial restrictions can adversely affect our operating profitability overseas  as well as in the us various agencies of the united states and other governments have from time to time imposed restrictions which have limited our ability to gain attractive opportunities or even operate in various countries 
these restrictions have in the past limited our foreign opportunities and may continue to do so in the future 

table of contents the oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive  and many of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry and  in particular  in the exploration and development of new reserves 
we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and other properties  for the equipment and labor required to explore  develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas production 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us 
as a consequence  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights 
in addition  many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas production  such as changes in worldwide prices and levels of production  the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 
we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel  including geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other specialists 
environmental compliance and remediation have resulted in and could continue to result in increased operating costs and capital requirements 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  substantial operating  maintenance  remediation and capital expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations 
our compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities beyond what we currently anticipate 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement action against us 
our past and present operations and those of companies we have acquired expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances 
for example we are investigating or remediating contamination at a large number of formerly and currently owned or operated sites and have recently recorded additional liabilities relating to some of these sites  and we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund and other multi party sites where we or our predecessors are alleged to have disposed of wastes in the past 
environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of those laws have become more stringent 
in some cases  they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
it is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental and legal matters and other contingencies because some potentially contaminated sites are in the early stages of investigation  and other sites may be identified in the future  cleanup requirements are difficult to predict at sites where remedial investigations have not been completed or final decisions have not been made regarding cleanup requirements  technologies or other factors that bear on cleanup costs  environmental laws frequently impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties  and it can be difficult to determine the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and their shares of responsibility for cleanup costs  environmental laws and regulations are continually changing  and court proceedings are inherently uncertain  and 
table of contents some legal matters are in the early stages of investigation or proceeding or their outcomes otherwise may be difficult to predict  and other legal matters may be identified in the future 
although our management believes that it has established appropriate reserves for cleanup costs  due to these uncertainties  we could be required to provide significant additional reserves in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations and possibly our financial position 
more detailed information with respect to the matters discussed above is set forth under the caption environmental regulation  under the environmental matters section of the management s discussion and analysis  and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item we are subject to lawsuits and claims involving substantial amounts and sometimes asserting novel theories of recovery we have a number of lawsuits and claims pending against us as a consequence of the past conduct of our business  some of which seek large amounts of damages 
while we currently believe that none of them will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity  certain of them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the accounting period or periods in which one or more of them might be resolved adversely 
in addition  certain of the pending matters are seeking to take advantage of expansive judicial interpretations of laws and precedents to impose liability for acts that we believed to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations at the time  and we could be the subject of similar such lawsuits and or claims in the future 
we depend upon payments from our subsidiaries 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through union oil and other domestic and international subsidiaries 
our principal sources of cash are dividends and advances from our subsidiaries  investments  including certain equity investments in other operating companies  payments by subsidiaries for services rendered and interest payments from subsidiaries on cash advances 
the amount of cash and income available to us from our subsidiaries largely depends upon each subsidiary s earnings and operating and capital requirements 
in addition  the ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments or transfer funds will depend on the subsidiaries earnings  business and tax considerations and legal restrictions 
failure to receive adequate cash and income from our subsidiaries could jeopardize our ability to make payments on debt securities we issue  including those held by unocal capital trust or that we may issue in the future to unocal capital trust ii  to satisfy our guarantees of debt securities of union oil and the trust preferred securities of unocal capital trust or that unocal capital trust ii may issue  and to pay dividends on our common stock and any preferred stock we may issue 
our international subsidiaries generate substantial foreign tax credits 
our ability to utilize these foreign tax credits is dependent on achieving a sufficient future level of taxable income in various jurisdictions over time and other factors and uncertainties  including tax law changes and the future level of commodity prices and operating costs 
failure to utilize these foreign tax credits over time could result in the future recognition of a valuation allowance in the applicable fiscal period and a higher effective tax rate  reducing stockholders equity and impacting earnings 
our debt level may limit our financial flexibility 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet showed billion of total debt outstanding 
in addition  unocal capital trust  a consolidated finance subsidiary  has million of convertible trust preferred securities outstanding  which represent beneficial interests in a like amount of subordinated debt we issued to it 
we may incur additional debt in the future  including in connection with acquisitions  recapitalizations and refinancings 

table of contents the level of our debt could have several important effects on our future operations  including  among others a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be applied to the payment of principal and interest on the debt and will not be available for other purposes  credit rating agencies have changed  and may continue to change  their ratings of our debt and other obligations as a result of changes in our debt level  financial condition  earnings and cash flow  which in turn impacts the costs  terms and conditions and availability of financing  covenants contained in our existing and future debt arrangements will require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  including possible acquisition opportunities  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate and other purposes may be limited or burdened by increased costs or more restrictive covenants  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to similar companies that have less debt  and our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions may increase 
we have substantial financial obligations and commitments which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the normal course of business we and our subsidiaries had incurred substantial contractual obligations for non cancelable operating leases  including drill ship leases  reimbursement obligations under standby letters of credit and performance bonds posted by third party financial institutions on our behalf  and other financial assurances that we and or our subsidiaries have given to satisfy the requirements of federal  state  local and foreign governmental entities and other parties 
furthermore  at year end  we had firmly committed to significant capital expenditures in for the development of offshore oil and gas fields  including related platforms  pipelines and other infrastructures 
we expect to finance a portion of these projects through governmental and multilateral agencies 
while we expect  based on current commodity prices  to be able to satisfy these obligations  to the extent they become due in  with cash on hand and expected to be generated from operating activities and asset sales  declines in commodity prices from current levels could require us to reduce discretionary capital expenditures  sell additional assets  incur significant additional debt or issue other securities to obtain the necessary funds 
a change of control of us could result in the acceleration of amounts due under our outstanding bank borrowings and trigger various change of control provisions included in employee and director plans and agreements 
two bank credit facilities guaranteed by unocal  under which union oil can borrow an aggregate of up to billion  provide for the termination of their loan commitments and require the prepayment of all outstanding borrowings under the facilities in the event that any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than percent of our then outstanding voting stock other than in a transaction having the approval of our board of directors  at least a majority of which are continuing directors  or our continuing directors cease to constitute at least a majority of the board 
if this situation were to occur  we would likely be required to refinance the outstanding indebtedness under these credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance this indebtedness or  if a refinancing were to occur  that the refinancing would be on terms favorable to us 

table of contents under various employee and director plans and agreements  in the event of a change in control  restricted stock would become unrestricted  unvested options and phantom units would vest  performance shares  performance bonus awards and incentive compensation would be paid out  and directors units would be paid out if the director has so elected 
in addition  certain of our employment and other agreements and severance plans covering most domestic employees and a limited number of non us employees provide for enhanced payments upon a termination of employment following a change of control 
we may issue preferred stock  the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue  without the approval of our stockholders  one or more series of preferred stock having such preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional and other rights  including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions  as the board of directors generally may determine 
the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power and or value of our common stock 
for example  we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions 
similarly  the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 
provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of us  even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make a change of control of us difficult  even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders  including provisions governing the classification  nomination and removal of directors  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent and regulating the ability of our stockholders to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings  and the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  which would cause extreme dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire a significant interest in unocal without advance approval of our board of directors  while section of the delaware general corporation law would impose restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between unocal and any holder of percent or more of our outstanding common stock 
we may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all 
the amount of cash dividends  if any  to be paid in the future will depend upon their declaration by our board of directors and upon our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the levels of our capital and exploration expenditures  our future business prospects and other related matters that our board of directors deems relevant 
in addition  under the terms of the outstanding trust preferred securities of unocal capital trust and the unocal subordinated debt securities held by that trust  we have the right  under certain circumstances to suspend the payment to that trust of interest on the subordinated debt securities  in which event the trust has the right to suspend the payment of distributions on its trust preferred securities 
in this situation  we would be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 

table of contents cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this report discusses our plans  strategies and expectations for our business and contains other forward looking statements  as this term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  as embodied in section a of the securities act  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
in addition  from time to time in the future our management or other persons acting on our behalf may make  in both written publications and oral presentations  additional forward looking statements to inform investors and other interested persons about our estimates and projections of  or increases or decreases in  amounts of our future revenues  prices  costs  earnings  cash flows  capital expenditures  assets  liabilities and other financial items 
certain statements may also contain estimates and projections of future levels of  or increases or decreases in  our crude oil and natural gas reserves and related finding and development costs  potential resources  production and related lifting costs  sales volumes and related prices  and other statistical items  plans and objectives of management regarding our future operations  projects  products and services  and certain assumptions underlying such estimates  projections  plans and objectives 
such forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate  projection  plan  target  goal  forecast  believes  expects  anticipates or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes  although these are not the exclusive means of identifying those statements

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
as part of its overall risk management strategies  the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce risks associated with these factors 
the company also trades hydrocarbon derivative instruments  such as futures contracts  swaps and options to exploit anticipated opportunities arising from commodity price fluctuations 
the company determines the fair values of its derivative financial instruments primarily based upon market quotes of exchange traded instruments 
most futures and options contracts are valued based upon direct exchange quotes or industry published price indices 
some instruments with longer maturity periods require financial modeling to accommodate calculations beyond the horizons of available exchange quotes 
these models calculate values for outer periods using current exchange quotes ie  forward curve and assumptions regarding interest rates  commodity and interest rate volatility and  in some cases  foreign currency exchange rates 
while the company feels that current exchange quotes and assumptions regarding interest rates and volatilities are appropriate factors to measure the fair value of its longer termed derivative instruments  other pricing assumptions or methodologies may lead to materially different results in some instances 
interest rate risk from time to time the company temporarily invests its excess cash in short term interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
company policies limit the amount of investment in securities of any one financial institution 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to the company 
the company s primary market risk exposure to changes in interest rates relates to the company s long term debt obligations 
the company manages its exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate risk sensitive derivative financial instruments  such as swaps or options may also be used depending upon market conditions 
the company evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of its interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a ten percent decrease in the company s weighted average borrowing costs at december  and  respectively  the potential increase in the fair value of the company s debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments  including the debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments of its subsidiaries  would have been approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents foreign exchange rate risk the company conducts business in various parts of the world and in various foreign currencies 
to limit the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk related to operating income  foreign sales agreements generally contain price provisions designed to insulate the company s sales revenues against adverse foreign currency exchange rates 
in most countries  energy products are valued and sold in us dollars and foreign currency operating cost exposures have not been significant 
in other countries  the company is paid for product deliveries in local currencies but at prices indexed to the us dollar 
these funds  less amounts retained for operating costs  are converted to us dollars as soon as practicable 
the company s canadian subsidiaries are paid in canadian dollars for their crude oil and natural gas sales and have outstanding canadian dollar denominated debt 
from time to time the company may purchase foreign currency options or enter into foreign currency swap or foreign currency forward contracts to limit the exposure related to its foreign currency debt or other obligations 
at december   the company had various foreign currency forward contracts outstanding related to operations in thailand 
the company evaluated the effect that near term changes in foreign exchange rates would have had on the fair value of the company s combined foreign currency position related to its outstanding foreign currency swaps  forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt 
assuming an adverse change of ten percent in foreign exchange rates at december  and  the potential decrease in fair value of the foreign currency swaps  foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt of the company and its subsidiaries would have been approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
commodity price risk the company is a producer  purchaser  marketer and trader of certain hydrocarbon commodities such as crude oil and condensate  natural gas and refined products and is subject to the associated price risks 
the company uses hydrocarbon price sensitive derivative instruments hydrocarbon derivatives  such as futures contracts  swaps  collars and options to mitigate its overall exposure to fluctuations in hydrocarbon commodity prices 
the company may also enter into hydrocarbon derivatives to hedge contractual delivery commitments and future crude oil and natural gas production against price exposure 
the company also actively trades hydrocarbon derivatives  primarily exchange regulated futures and options contracts  subject to internal policy limitations 
the company uses a variance covariance value at risk model to assess the market risk of its hydrocarbon derivatives 
value at risk represents the potential loss in fair value the company would experience on its hydrocarbon derivatives  using calculated volatilities and correlations over a specified time period with a given confidence level 
the company s risk model is based upon current market data and uses a three day time interval with a percent confidence level 
the model includes offsetting physical positions for any existing hydrocarbon derivatives related to the company s fixed price pre paid crude oil and pre paid natural gas sales 
the model also includes the company s net interests in its subsidiaries crude oil and natural gas hydrocarbon derivatives and forward sales contracts 
based upon the company s risk model  the value at risk related to hydrocarbon derivatives held for hedging purposes was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the value at risk related to hydrocarbon derivatives held for non hedging purposes was immaterial at december   and approximately million at december in order to provide a more comprehensive view of the company s commodity price risk  a tabular presentation of open hydrocarbon derivatives is also provided 
the following table sets forth the future volumes and price ranges of hydrocarbon derivatives held by the company at december   along with the fair values of those instruments
