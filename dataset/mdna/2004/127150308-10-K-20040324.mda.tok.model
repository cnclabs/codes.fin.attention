item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general net sales 
net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non comparable stores 
a store is not included in comparable store sales until the first day of the fiscal month following the twelfth full month of sales 
non comparable store sales include sales generated at new stores prior to the period when they are considered comparable stores and sales generated from stores that we have since closed 
shipping and handling 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in net sales at the time of shipment 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  cost of freight from vendors  payroll for our design  buying and merchandising personnel and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  contingent rents  common area maintenance and real estate taxes 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses include payroll  payroll taxes  health benefits  insurance  credit card processing fees  depreciation  licenses and taxes as well as marketing and advertising expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include district and regional manager payroll  other corporate personnel payroll and employee benefits  employment taxes  insurance  legal and other professional fees and other corporate level expenses 
corporate level expenses are primarily attributable to our corporate headquarters in new york 
accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are regularly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
inventories 
merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market using the retail method of accounting 
we make assumptions to adjust the value of inventory based on historical experience and current information 
this procedure inherently reduces the carrying value of inventories as markdowns are initiated 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized at the point of sale  which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over the counter transaction or upon receipt by a customer 
sales of merchandise via our website are recognized at the time of shipment to the customer 
our customers have the right to return merchandise 
sales are reported net of actual and estimated returns 
we maintain a reserve for potential product returns and record  as a reduction to sales  a provision for estimated product returns  which is determined based on historical experience 
deferred rent 
many of our operating leases contain predetermined fixed increases of the minimum rental rate during the initial lease term 
for those leases  the company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight line basis and records the difference between the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid as deferred rent 
the company receives construction allowances upon entering certain store leases 
these construction allowances are recorded as reductions of the related leasehold improvements and are amortized over the term of the related lease 
the amortization is recorded as a reduction of rent expense 
deferred construction allowances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
weeks ended december  december  december  operating results net sales cost of sales gross profit store operating expenses general and administrative expenses operating income other income net income before income taxes income taxes net income weeks ended december  fiscal compared to weeks ended december  fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects million of additional net sales as a result of a increase in comparable store sales 
the remainder of the increase was the result of additional net sales from non comparable stores 
we believe our new store expansion and remodeling program will help to materially increase sales during the next few years 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase in gross profit was the combined result of higher net sales and an increase in gross profit margins  due to a more focused approach to inventory management 
we plan to increase inventory turns in future years  as we reduce dress inventory levels  turns of which are historically slower than sportswear inventory turns 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this was due primarily to an increase in the total number of new stores open 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from  primarily due to an increase in payroll expense of million and an increase in advertising expense of million 
we anticipate store operating expenses will run slightly higher than historical levels  as a percent of sales in the short term  as we increase our rate of store expansion 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
this increase was primarily attributable to increase in corporate level payroll of million and professional fess of  we anticipate general and administrative expenses will return to lower historical levels in the next few years  as we have completed most of the headquarters staffing necessary to fuel the current store expansion 
other income 
other income increased to  from  primarily attributable to higher average cash balances during fiscal  partially offset by lower interest rates in fiscal we expect interest income to grow in the future due to stronger cash flows from operations and higher interest rates  as the us economy recovers 
income taxes 
income taxes increased to million from million  an increase of million  over the same period last year 
this increase was attributable to higher taxable income  as well as an increase in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in the overall effective income tax rate is attributable to increased levels of federal taxable income subject to tax in a higher tax bracket  as well as a change in the mix of income subject to tax in the various states in which we conduct business

gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was the combined result of higher net sales and increased gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher initial margins resulting from a reduction in the number of our vendors and the number of stock keeping units 
these reductions enabled us to commit to bulk fabric purchases and increased our ability to receive favorable pricing from vendors 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from  primarily due to an increase in marketing and advertising expenses of million which were partially offset by a reduction in store operating expenses as a percentage of sales  due to the fixed nature of most store operating expenses

quarterly results and seasonality we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by highest sales during our fourth fiscal quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during our third fiscal quarter july  august and september 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended december  we derived this data from our unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have prepared this information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and that we have included all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document 
the operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period

we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
cash flows have increased significantly in fiscal and  due to the dramatic increase in gross margin contribution 
we expect this trend to continue over the next several years 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  and an increase in inventories of million  primarily due to the increase in new stores open of stores 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  a decrease in receivables of million  an increase in accounts payable of  and an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  a decrease in inventory of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal these amounts were used for the purchase of marketable securities as well as the payment for equipment and leasehold improvements in new and remodeled stores 
our capital requirements depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal to fund new store openings and remodelings are approximately to million 
based on our experience with new store openings  we estimate that the average net investment to open new stores is approximately  to  which includes new store opening expenses and initial inventory  net of landlord contributions 
we estimate that the average net investment to remodel an existing store is approximately  to  net of landlord contributions 
cash provided by used in financing activities was negligible in fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from stock issuances and stock option exercises 
we have a line of credit with fleet bank  na  permitting us to borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a maximum annual rate equal to the bank s prime rate  currently 
the agreement relating to this facility contains selected financial and other covenants 
in addition  the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness or create or incur liens on our assets 
while this facility is unsecured  if a default occurs under the facility  we are required to grant the lender a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable 
we have at all times been in compliance with all loan covenants 
this facility currently expires in november we believe that cash flows from operations  our current available cash and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated new store opening expenses for at least the next months 
if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion or remodeling program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our minimum contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of december  payments due in period within after total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations employment contracts   operating leases      total      payments due in period within after total year years years years in thousands commercial commitments credit facility letter of credit   total   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear the risk in two specific ways 
first  the revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  the statement of income and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowing under our credit facility 
however  we may borrow funds under the revolving credit facility  as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are included in cash and equivalents as well as marketable securities on our balance sheet  if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
among other things  the statement does not affect the classification or measurement of convertible bonds  puttable stock  or other outstanding shares that are conditionally redeemable 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise will be effective as of december   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments

in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no

fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
we have determined that the adoption of finr will not have any impact on our financial position and results of operations
