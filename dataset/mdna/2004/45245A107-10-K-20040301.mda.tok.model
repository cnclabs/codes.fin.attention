item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview imation is a global technology company that derives revenue and profits primarily from the sale of removable data storage media products to both consumers and business 
these products range from floppy diskettes and recordable cds and dvds to tape cartridges used in small medium businesses to high capacity tape cartridges used in large automated tape silos in a data center environment 
these products are sold in over countries outside the us  and approximately percent of the company s total revenues came from outside the us the company also has a specialty papers business  representing less than five percent of revenue  which manufactures and distributes carbonless paper for use in the creation of multi part business forms 
the core data storage market presents attractive growth opportunities as well as challenges 
the market is highly competitive  characterized by continuing changes in technology  pricing pressure on media products  diverse distribution channels  and a large variety of formats for both tape and optical products 
the company is challenged to deliver a broad portfolio of products across diverse distribution channels and geographies and maintain low overall costs 
success in this market is dependent on being early to market with new formats  having efficient manufacturing and supply chain operations  working closely with leading oem s original equipment manufacturers to develop enhancements to existing and new formats  carrying a broad assortment of products across multiple competing tape drive platforms  and having a broad geographic and market coverage across a variety of distribution channels 
while the overall removable data storage media industry is a growth industry  the highest revenue growth opportunities over the next three to five years lie outside the company s historical core magnetic tape and diskette media businesses 
these higher growth markets include newer tape formats in semi proprietary or open systems environments  recordable optical discs  which currently are more consumer oriented products  and removable flash memory  which the company has not  to date  marketed 
these higher revenue growth opportunities described above provide revenue streams that are  as a rule  at lower gross profit margins than the company s historical gross margins on the core magnetic media business 
as a result  the company s strategy has been to consciously position itself to profitably take advantage of these growth opportunities by establishing strategic sourcing  brand distribution and licensing arrangements which require relatively low capital investments and by implementing a relatively flat and efficient operating structure  which can support higher revenue without the need to add substantial infrastructure or overhead costs  thus delivering increased gross margin dollars and operating profit growth on increased revenues 
for example  while the company has intellectual property  patents and know how in optical media  it sources these products from third party manufacturers 
the resulting business model can be thought of as a hybrid between a manufacturer and a brand distributor 
the growth opportunities in the removable data storage media market are also generally higher in emerging markets such as asia and latin america than in more established markets in the us and western europe 
as a result  as the company pursues growth opportunities in emerging markets  revenues are expected to increasingly be derived from sales outside the us results of operations on august   the company consummated the sale of its north america dss business to decisionone corporation decisionone 
these operations are presented in the company s consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations 
on december   the company closed on the sale of its worldwide color proofing and color software business

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact the company s results of operations 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances significant management judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the us and outside the us accordingly  the company must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
the determination requires the company to make several estimates and assumptions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income  and other complex issues  may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in adjustments to the company s income tax balances that are material to its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in conjunction with its financial reporting  the company assesses both tax reserves and recoverability of its deferred tax assets  and provides reserves for potential tax audit adjustments and valuation allowances to offset deferred tax assets  as needed 
due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize some portion of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded as of december   resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
the future recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the sufficient generation of future taxable income 
the company believes that it will generate future taxable income to recover the recorded net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company may need to adjust  upwards or downwards  the valuation allowance 
litigation management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which the company can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  management believes that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  would not be material to the company s financial position 
as additional information becomes available  potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
the company s most significant litigation matter relates to jazz photo  which is described in item to this form k and note to the consolidated financial statements 
excess inventory and obsolescence accruals the company writes down its inventory for estimated excess and obsolescence to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
rebates the company maintains an accrual for customer rebates which totaled million as of december  this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
other accrued liabilities the company also maintains other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to the company 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
recently issued accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits revised 
this revised statement provides required disclosures for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans 
the company adopted the disclosure requirements of this statement as of december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities  for which they do not have controlling interests through voting or other rights  if they are determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of variable economic interests 
fin provides guidance for determining the primary beneficiary for entities with multiple economic interests 
fin is effective in for interests obtained after january  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  fin  as amended  is applied to interests in variable interest entities acquired prior to february  the company believes the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
forward looking statements the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements with respect to future goals of the company  including statements contained in this report  the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the company s reports to shareholders 
the company wishes to caution investors not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
based on estimates from industry analysts  the removable media industry is expected to grow between five and ten percent over the next several years 
however  in any given period the rate of growth may fall outside that range based on industry or economic factors

certain information contained in this report which does not relate to historical financial information  including the targeted projections  may be deemed to constitute forward looking statements 
the words or phrases is targeting  will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project  believe or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results  and those presently anticipated or projected 
risk factors due to significant risks and uncertainties which exist even in the most stable economic environment  the company cannot predict  with certainty  the operating results for future periods 
among the factors that could cause the company s actual results in the future to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods are the following competitive industry conditions the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company s competitors are both larger and smaller than the company in terms of resources and market share 
the marketplaces in which the company operates are generally characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  a variety of distribution channels  relatively large and aggressive marketing efforts  and aggressive pricing practices which result in consistent price erosion 
in these highly competitive markets  the company s success will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to develop and introduce differentiated and innovative products  services and customer solutions cost effectively and on a timely basis 
the success of the company s offerings is dependent on several factors including its ability to develop relationships with distributors and oems  competitive technology capabilities  differentiation from competitive offerings  the timing of new product introductions  effectiveness of marketing programs  and low manufacturing and supply chain costs 
although the company believes that it can take the necessary steps to meet the competitive challenges of these marketplaces  no assurance can be given with regard to the company s ability to take these steps  the actions of competitors  some of which will have greater resources than the company  or the pace of technological changes 
new products and services the company s competitive position and operating results are dependent upon its ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market innovative new products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to introduce new products or maintain competitive technology competencies  that the markets will be receptive to its new products  that the company s marketing programs will be successful  or that the company s competitors will not introduce more advanced products ahead of the company 
the company is also dependent in some cases upon various third parties  such as certain drive manufacturers  for new product introductions  the timing of which is out of the company s control 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will maintain existing or create new oem relationships  the lack of which could cause a material adverse impact on its business and financial results 
also  while the company currently has access to significant proprietary technologies through internal development and licensing arrangements with third parties  there can be no assurance that it will continue to have access to new competitive technologies that may be required to introduce new products
