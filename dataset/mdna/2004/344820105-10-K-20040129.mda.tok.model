item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results 
the application of those critical accounting policies requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
impairment of goodwill effective november   the company implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but instead will be tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined that it is contained within one reporting unit and as such  impairment is tested at the company level 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed goodwill transition and annual impairment tests prescribed by sfas and concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed 
patronage dividends as a stockholder of wakefern  the company earns a share of wakefern s earnings  which is distributed as a patronage dividend 
this dividend is based on a distribution of wakefern s operating profits for its fiscal year  which ends the saturday closest to september  in proportion to the dollar volume of business transacted by each member of wakefern during that fiscal year 
patronage dividends are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the company accrues estimated patronage dividends due from wakefern quarterly based on an estimate of the annual wakefern patronage dividend and an estimate of the company s share of this annual dividend based on the company s estimated proportional share of the dollar volume of business transacted with wakefern that year 
these estimates are based on both historical patronage dividend percentages and current volume merchandise purchased from wakefern 
pension plans we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans covering administrative personnel and members of a union 
the plans assets consist primarily of publicly traded stocks and fixed income securities 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent  in part  on the company s selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
these assumptions are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in future periods 
while management believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect pension obligations and future expense 
based on the company s review of market interest rates  the company lowered the discount rate to a range from to for fiscal compared to a range of to for fiscal the company evaluated the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and concluded no change in this assumption was necessary in estimating pension plan obligations and expense 
workers compensation insurance from june  to may  we maintained workers compensation insurance with various carriers on a retrospective basis 
we have established reserve amounts based upon our evaluation of the status of claims still open as of november  and loss development factors used by the insurance industry 
as of november   the worker s compensation reserve totaled approximately  such reserve amount is only an estimate and there can be no assurance that our eventual workers compensation obligations will not exceed the amount of the reserve 
however  we believe that any difference between the amount recorded for our estimated liability and the costs of settling the actual claims would not be material to the results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity the company is a party to a third amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement the credit agreement with four financial institutions 
the credit agreement serves as our primary funding source for working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and provided for a total commitment of up to  including a revolving credit facility the revolving note of up to  a term loan the term loan in the amount of  and a capital expenditures facility the capex facility of up to  the credit agreement expires december  as of november  the company owed  on the term loan and  under the capex facility 
on july  the credit agreement was amended to allow the company to borrow under the revolving credit facility  on any tuesday or wednesday  up to  in excess of the availability under the borrowing base limitation of of eligible inventory as long as a like amount of cash and cash equivalents are on hand at store level or in transit to the company s banks 
this provision expired december  we will evaluate whether we will need to request an excess availability provision in fiscal additionally  the number of libor contracts allowed to be outstanding at any one time was increased from three to five 
for the year ended november   the value of the accrued benefits under the company s pension plans exceeded the aggregate fair value of the assets of the plans by   more than the amount permitted under the credit agreement 
this event of default was waived by our lenders 
the credit agreement contains a number of covenants with which the company must comply 
non compliance with any of such covenants could affect the availability of funds under the credit agreement and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and liquidity 
the company is in compliance with the major financial covenants under the credit agreement as of november   as follows actual as defined in the financial covenant credit agreement credit agreement adjusted ebitda greater than   leverage ratio less than to to debt service coverage ratio greater than to to adjusted capex less than   store project capex less than   excludes obligations under capitalized leases  interest expense and depreciation expense attributable to capitalized leases and changes in the lifo reserve 
the leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the current and non current portions of long term debt and long term debt related party by adjusted ebitda 
the debt service coverage ratio is calculated by dividing operating cash flow by the sum of adjusted net interest expense  which excludes interest on capitalized leases  the current provision for income taxes and regularly scheduled principal payments  which exclude principal payments on capitalized leases 
operating cash flow is calculated by subtracting amounts expended for property and equipment which are not used for projects in excess of   in fiscal from adjusted ebitda 
adjusted capex is all capital expenditures other than new replacement store project capex 
represents limitations on capital expenditures for fiscal represents capital expenditures for fiscal includes amounts available but not used in the prior fiscal year and available to be carried forward to fiscal  for adjusted capex and  for store project capex 
on january  we financed the purchase of  of equipment for the new store location in woodbridge  new jersey 
the note bears interest at and is payable in monthly installments over its seven year term

the note bears interest at and is payable in monthly installments over its five year term 
during the fifty two weeks ended november   the company was required to make an additional investment in wakefern for two new stores 
in addition  on june  wakefern increased the amount that each shareholder is required to invest in wakefern s capital stock to a maximum of  for each store operated by such shareholder member 
previously  the maximum was  per store 
the above changes in the amounts of required investment increased our investment in wakefern by  which will be paid weekly  without interest  over a four year period starting september  no cash dividends have been paid on the common stock since  and we have no present intentions or ability to pay any dividends in the near future on our common stock 
the credit agreement does not permit the payment of any cash dividends on the company s common stock 
working capital at november  the company had working capital of  as compared to working capital deficiencies of  and  on november  and november   respectively 
the company normally requires small amounts of working capital since inventory is generally sold at approximately the same time that payments to wakefern and other suppliers are due and most sales are for cash or cash equivalents 
working capital improved in fiscal primarily as the result of the increase in receivables from wakefern 
this increase relates primarily to receivables for patronage dividends and other current amounts due us 
when collected  the proceeds from these receivables will be used to reduce the revolving note which is classified as long term borrowings 
this will result in a corresponding decrease in working capital 
the balance of accounts receivables consist primarily of returned checks due the company  third party pharmacy insurance claims and organization charge accounts 
the terms of most receivables are days or less 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is large in comparison to the amount of accounts receivable because the allowance consists primarily of a reserve for returned checks which are not written off until all collection efforts are exhausted 
working capital improved in fiscal primarily as the result of the increase in receivables due from landlords for construction allowances for the woodbridge and ewing  new jersey locations 
when these receivables were collected  the proceeds were used to reduce the revolving note which is classified as long term borrowings 
this resulted in a corresponding decrease in working capital 
working capital decreased in fiscal primarily as the result of the net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  over the increase in inventory
