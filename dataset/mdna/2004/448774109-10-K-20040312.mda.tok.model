item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of hydril s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with hydril s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged worldwide in engineering  manufacturing and marketing premium connections and pressure control products used for oil and gas drilling and production 
our premium connection products are marketed primarily to exploration and production company operators 
we sell our pressure control products primarily to drilling contractors for use in oil and gas drilling and to a lesser extent to exploration and production companies for oil and gas production 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent on the activity levels in the oil and gas industry and our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
the level of these capital expenditures is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and gas prices  which have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
generally  increasing commodity prices result in increased oil and gas exploration and production  which translates into greater demand for oilfield products and services 
conversely  falling commodity prices generally result in reduced demand for oilfield products and services 
historically  changes in budgets and activity levels by oil and gas exploration and production companies have lagged significant movements in commodity prices 
the number of rigs drilling at target depths greater than  feet and the number of rigs drilling in water depths greater than  feet generally drive the level of demand for our premium connection products 
the main factors that affect sales of pressure control capital equipment products are the level of construction of new drilling rigs and the rate at which existing rigs are refurbished 
demand for our pressure control aftermarket replacement parts  repair and field services primarily depends upon the level of worldwide offshore drilling activity  as well as the total us rig count 
beginning in mid  the price of oil increased significantly due to opec member countries reducing production and recovering worldwide demand for oil 
in addition  gas prices increased significantly during this period and peaked in late as a result of low levels of gas storage in the united states 
these higher prices triggered a substantial increase in the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the united states and canada 
the average weekly rig count for the united states and canada combined for  as measured by baker hughes  increased over the average weekly rig count for rig counts continued to improve during the first half of with the combined rig count for the united states and canada peaking in july of these improvements in market fundamentals stimulated an increase in the demand for our products in the united states and canada  in particular premium connection products and pressure control aftermarket replacement parts 
in response to this increase in demand  we completed a expansion of our premium connection capacity at our plant in nisku  canada in january  and increased capacity in the united states by during and however  beginning mid  commodity prices started to fall  particularly natural gas prices  which fell sharply  and averaged mm btu henry hub in the fourth quarter of  down from the first quarter 
west texas intermediate crude oil prices declined as well  from an average of per barrel in the first quarter of to an average of per barrel in the fourth quarter  down 
this decline in 
table of contents commodity prices led to a decline in drilling activity in the united states and canada  in particular in the number of rigs drilling in deep formations for natural gas in north america 
the rig counts in the united states and canada combined  as measured by baker hughes  fell from july to december this decrease included a reduction in the number of rigs drilling over  feet and the number of rigs in water depths greater than  feet 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we began to experience a decline in demand for premium connections and late in that quarter  a significant decrease in plant utilization in the united states 
accordingly  we reduced our premium connection workforce at our manufacturing facilities in the united states by approximately in january during  commodity prices began to recover from their levels in the fourth quarter of from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  us natural gas prices increased and us crude oil prices rose 
however  the commodity price recovery  which in part was fueled by global uncertainties over the war with iraq and political unrest and a labor strike in venezuela  was accompanied by a decrease in drilling activity 
for  several factors contributed to the decrease in spending by oil and gas companies for oil and gas exploration and development in the united states despite increasing commodity prices 
first  the downturn in the us economy during resulted in reduced capital spending by our customers 
these conservative spending practices focused on balance sheet improvements  primarily paying down debt  rather than spending for exploration and production 
in addition  the uncertainty of global events  most significantly the possibility of a war in iraq  led to less spending 
as a result  rig counts in the united states and canada were reduced and demand for premium connections and aftermarket parts and service decreased during commodity prices during were relatively stable and up slightly from the fourth quarter of crude oil prices west texas intermediate averaged per barrel during  up from the average 
natural gas prices henry hub mmbtu averaged during up from the average 
as a result of higher  more stable commodity prices during the year  drilling activity in the united states rose throughout the year 
the us rig count ended at  which was above year end the average us deep formation rig count rigs drilling to a target depth greater than  feet ended at  an increase of over year end the international rig count rigs drilling outside of the united states and canada ended at  up from the year ended the worldwide offshore rig count for the year ended of was up compared with the year ended despite stable commodity prices and rising rig counts in the united states  our revenue declined in both our premium connection and pressure control segments 
for premium connections  this decline was the result of reduced demand in certain international markets  in part due to political and civil uncertainties  and lower demand in the us and canadian market as a result of our distributors reducing inventory stocking levels and placing only limited replenishment orders 
in addition deep formation and deep water drilling activity did not recover proportionately to the overall rig count increase 
many of the rigs returning to work in the united states and canada during were for shallow wells that do not require premium connection products 
our international premium connection business typically has longer lead times than our north american business  generally three to six months  and is generally not impacted by rig count changes in north america 
the international rig count rigs drilling outside of the united states and canada ended at  up from the year ended the increase in international drilling activity in reflected rising rig counts in certain markets 
however  declining rig counts in some key oil and gas markets had an adverse effect 
the level of demand in our key international markets can fluctuate significantly depending on levels of political stability  civil unrest and general economic conditions 
during  venezuela and nigeria had periods of instability which reduced the level of drilling activity and the demand for our products 
demand in the industry for new pressure control capital equipment was not as strong during the period of through as compared to demand for aftermarket replacement parts  due to the low level of rig construction and refurbishment worldwide 
however  in march  our pressure control segment received a million order for four offshore drilling blowout prevention and control systems from globalsantafe corporation 
additionally during we received two orders from a subsidiary of diamond offshore drilling  inc for blowout preventer multiplex control systems 
during and  we benefited from these orders as revenue and gross profit was recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method and 
table of contents significant progress was made during the year 
substantially all of these orders were completed during and during  the capital equipment market continued to be weak  and we received no new significant capital equipment orders 
due to these market conditions  capital equipment revenue decreased during the year and was below the level in however  because of the increasing us rig count during the pressure control aftermarket business increased by over and partially offset the decline in capital equipment 
revenue with the exception of revenue from pressure control long term projects  we record revenue for all products and services at the time such products are delivered or services are provided 
in  of our revenue was recorded on this basis 
for our pressure control long term projects which are generally contracts from six to eighteen months in duration and an estimated contract price in excess of million  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to estimated final cost 
we use this method because we consider expended contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
if a long term contract was anticipated to have an estimated loss  such loss would be recognized in the period in which the loss becomes apparent 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for more information regarding estimates and assumptions relating to revenue recognition 
gross profit our gross profit is the difference between our revenue and our cost of sales 
cost of sales for our products include purchased raw materials and components  manufacturing labor  plant overhead expenses  a portion of engineering expenses  and building and equipment depreciation 
some of the costs are fixed cost and cause our margins to suffer when demand is low and manufacturing capacity is underutilized 
also included in cost of sales are the costs of product warranty  product liability insurance and inventory valuation adjustments  including last in  first out inventory valuation adjustments and adjustments for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we do not take title to the tubulars we thread for the united states and canadian market  and therefore  own no inventories of tubulars for sales in these countries 
however  we purchase tubulars for fulfilling a portion of our existing orders outside of the united states and canada  which is generally less than of our total revenue 
for our pressure control products  we have inventory for existing orders in process as well as a replacement parts inventory both internationally and domestically 
a majority of our inventory is for our pressure control segment 
selling  general and administration expenses our selling  general and administration expenses include engineering expenses that relate to research  product design  development and maintenance  as well as sales and marketing expenses  which consist mostly of personnel and related expenses  and commissions paid to third party agents selling our products 
also included are general and administration expenses that relate to accounting  treasury  information technology  human resources  legal expenses and corporate overhead 
operating income loss our operating income loss is gross profit less selling  general and administration expenses 
operating income loss is comprised of the operating income of each of our premium connection and pressure control segments and the portion of selling  general and administration expenses  referred to as corporate administration  which is not allocated to either segment 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue decreased million  or  to million for from million in premium connection revenue decreased to million and pressure control revenue decreased to million 
the decrease in premium connection revenue was primarily the result of lower demand in certain international markets  primarily west africa  due in part to political and civil uncertainties  and the united states as a result of our distributors reducing inventory stocking levels and placing only limited replenishment orders 
the decrease in pressure control revenue was attributable to a decrease in revenue from capital equipment due to a lower level of long term capital projects in backlog  consistent with the low level of new rig construction and refurbishment in the industry generally 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in aftermarket revenue due to an increase in the us total rig count and consumption of spare parts in the drilling process 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million for from million in this decline was not as severe as the revenue decline because lower sales volumes were partially offset by a product mix shift in our pressure control segment from lower margin capital equipment to higher margin aftermarket replacement parts 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for compared to million for this increase was the result of consulting fees related to the research and experimentation income tax credit study see provision for income taxes below for details  and other tax planning strategies  expenses related to merger and acquisition activities  and higher legal expenses related to corporate governance compliance  which were partially offset by lower management incentive accruals 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from for to for operating income operating income decreased million to million for  compared to million for operating income for our premium connection segment decreased to million for compared to million for operating income for our pressure control segment increased million  or  from million for to million for corporate and administration expenses were million for compared to million in interest expense interest expense decreased million to million for  from million in the reduction in interest expense was due to lower outstanding debt compared to as well as the payoff of our remaining debt at the end of the second quarter of provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million to million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily the result of a research and experimentation tax credit of million that was recorded during the third quarter of this credit covers qualified spending for the ten year period from through prior to  the company was an alternative minimum tax payer and could not benefit from this type of tax credit 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million in premium connection revenue decreased to million and pressure control revenue increased to million 
the decrease in premium connection revenue was primarily the result of decreased demand for our products and services as a result of decreased drilling activity in our north american united states and canada markets 
this decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from our international premium connections as a result of strong demand in our niche markets 
the increase in pressure control revenue was attributable to a increase in revenue from capital equipment due to an increase in percentage of completion accounting method revenue from project orders received during and this increase was partially offset by an decrease in aftermarket replacement parts revenue due to lower worldwide offshore drilling rig activity and declines in the united states rig count 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million for from million in the increase was primarily due to increased efficiencies in our premium connection plants and a product mix shift in our premium connection segment to higher margin products  partially offset by lower margins in the pressure control segment resulting from the increase in capital equipment revenue and the decrease in aftermarket replacement parts sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for compared to million for the increase was due to higher engineering costs to support research and development activities  engineering design expenses to support the higher pressure control capital equipment project backlog during the year  a full year of subsea mudlift drilling expenses related to advancing and commercializing the technology and higher sales and marketing expenses to support international markets 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from for to for operating income operating income increased million to million for  compared to million for operating income for our premium connection segment increased to million for compared to million for operating income for our pressure control segment decreased million  or  from million for to million for corporate and administration expenses were million for compared to million in interest expense interest expense increased million to million for from million for the increase was the result of a million make whole premium on our prepayment of million of our senior unsecured notes in august  which was partially offset by lower interest expense for the remainder of the year 
other expense other expense was million for compared to million for other expense for included million to maintain surplus real estate and facilities not used in operations  which was partially offset by miscellaneous income items 
other expense for included million in expenses incurred in facilitating the offering of common stock by certain of our stockholders in the second quarter of and million to maintain surplus real estate and facilities not used in operations 
for further information on these transactions  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  fund new product development and provide additional working capital 
our primary source of funds is cash flow from operations 
in addition  we have available million in committed revolving credit facilities 
in  we also repaid million of senior notes at maturity and as a result have no long term debt outstanding 
in addition  we made a million contribution to our frozen defined benefit pension plan  which  after the contribution  had an unfunded benefit obligation of approximately million at december  based on current expectations  we do not plan to make any additional contributions to the plan during operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for and million for cash provided by operations in was primarily due to earnings and contractual cash payments received from customers on long term capital equipment projects  which was partially offset by a million contribution to the us defined benefit pension plan 
cash provided by operations in was primarily from earnings  contractual cash payments received from customers for progress made on capital equipment long term projects and utilization of deferred tax assets  the effects of which were partially offset by higher working capital requirements 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in of million as compared to was primarily due to the expenditure of contractual cash payments from customers received in for completion of large project orders 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million in the investment of cash in was primarily for capital spending while the net cash used in investing activities for was attributable to capital spending of million and net investments in held to maturity securities of million 
the investment of cash in of million was solely for capital expenditures 
for more information on capital expenditures for the three years ended december  see capital expenditures below 
credit facilities we have two unsecured revolving lines of credit for working capital requirements that provide up to million in total committed revolving credit borrowings through june  of these  million relates to our us operations and million relates to our foreign operations 
under these lines  we may borrow  at our election  at either a prime or libor based interest rate 
interest rates fluctuate depending on our leverage ratio and are prime minus a spread ranging from to basis points or libor plus a spread ranging from to basis points 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under either facility 
our us revolving credit agreement contains covenants with respect to debt levels  tangible net worth and debt to capitalization ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
our foreign line of credit does not contain any separate financial covenants but contains cross default provisions which would be triggered by a default under our us line of credit 
the terms of the company s credit facilities allows for the issuance of letters of credit 
the amount of outstanding letters of credit reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facilities 
the letters of credit are generally short in duration and immaterial in amount 
at december  there was approximately million outstanding in letters of credit 

table of contents contractual cash obligations the following paragraph summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in millions operating leases purchase obligations total represents obligations for minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases 
the company s lease commitments are primarily for operating facilities  vehicles and equipment 
represents obligations under outstanding purchase orders and other commitments 
the table excludes other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet which consists primarily of post retirement  health and life benefits 
this amount is impacted by  among other things  funding levels and changes in plan assumptions 
the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs 
the average payout under the post retirement health benefits plan over the past five years was approximately million per year 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s obligation under the defined benefit pension plan and the post retirement health and life benefit plans 
other indebtedness in june  the company issued million of senior notes due june  during the third quarter of  the company prepaid million of the aggregate principal amount of the unsecured notes plus a make whole premium of million relating to this prepayment 
the make whole premium was included as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company repaid the remaining million at maturity on june  technology the joint industry project to develop dual gradient drilling technology completed its work by successfully drilling a test well in the gulf of mexico in the fourth quarter of during and  hydril continued separately to refine the design of the equipment and pursue commercialization 
expenditures to commercialize this technology were expensed in and and were less than of total selling  general and administrative expenses in each year 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for were million  which included million for our premium connection segment and million for our pressure control segment  in both cases primarily to support plant and equipment for our manufacturing operations  and million for general corporate purposes 
capital expenditures for were million  which included million in our premium connection segment of which million related to plant capacity expansion and million related to support of manufacturing operations 
also included was million in our pressure control segment  of which million was used to replace and refurbish machine tools and to construct a new deepwater assembly building for blowout preventer stack assembly at our houston plant and million was used to support engineering research and development and manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for general corporate purposes were million for capital expenditures for were million  which consisted of million for our premium connection business  primarily related to the expansion of manufacturing capacity in north america  
table of contents million for our pressure control segment  primarily for the replacement and upgrade of manufacturing machine tools  and million for general corporate purposes 
if current industry conditions continue  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately to million  primarily to support manufacturing operations and engineering  research and development activities 
dividends we have no plans to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock or our class b common stock for the foreseeable future 
backlog pressure control capital equipment backlog which includes orders for capital equipment and long term projects  at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was the result of work completed and revenue recognized on several large long term capital equipment project orders and no new substantial project orders were received during the year 
substantially all of the remaining revenue from projects currently in backlog is expected to be recorded during the first half of we recognize the revenue and gross profit from pressure control long term projects using the percentage of completion accounting method 
as revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method  the order value in backlog is reduced 
it is possible for orders to be cancelled  however  in the event of cancellations all costs incurred would be billable to the customer 
our backlog of premium connection and pressure control aftermarket parts and service is not a meaningful measure of business prospects due to the quick turnover of such orders 
tax matters as of december   we had deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  of million 
these assets are benefits to us as long as we expect to have sufficient future income in the united states 
management projections indicate that sufficient income will be generated in future years to realize the tax assets  and therefore  no valuation allowance was required
