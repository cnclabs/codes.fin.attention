item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read along with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance and that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including risks discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  construct and market single family and multi family homes primarily to move up and luxury homebuyers and develop land for sale to other homebuilders 
our operations are currently focused primarily in five markets san francisco bay area  southland los angeles  san diego riverside  sacramento  and northern virginia 
our goal is to maximize the total return on our common stockholders equity over the long term 
in  we earned a return on opening common stockholders equity 
the  lots that we control  of which we own  directly or through joint ventures  provide a strong foundation for our future homebuilding business and visibility on our future cash flow and earnings 
the lots we control represent in excess of a year lot supply  based on planned home closings of approximately  our lots controlled as of december  include  lots located in sacramento  california  a market we entered in the majority of our lots in this new market are under option and our investment as of december  is nominal 
however  it is our intention to expand operations in this market within the next two to three years 
homebuilding is our primary source of revenue and has represented of our total revenue since our operations are positioned to close between  and  homes per year 
operating in markets with higher price points and catering to move up and luxury buyers  our average sales price in of  was well in excess of the national average sales price of approximately  we also sell serviced and unserviced lots to other homebuilders generally on an opportunistic basis where we can enhance our returns  reduce risk in a market or redeploy capital to an asset providing higher returns 
in  we sold over  lots  the majority of which were bulk sales of raw or undeveloped land in southern california 
the magnitude of our lot sales in was the result of a number of factors 
firstly  we were successful receiving final approvals on a number of parcels of land that we had under option resulting in excess inventory in our southern california operations  in particular the san diego riverside area 
our excess inventory  combined with strong market conditions and opportunities to acquire or option additional lots in these same areas  enabled us to be pro active and sell lots realizing revenue and net income of million and million  respectively 
in total  these lot sales represented of our net income in while we continue to own a significant number of lots in these markets  we do not expect to sell as many lots in in addition to our housing and land inventory and investments in housing and land joint ventures  which together comprised of our total assets as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in other assets at that point in time 
other assets consist of homebuyer receivables of million  deferred taxes of million  and mortgages and other receivables of million 
homebuyer receivables consist primarily of proceeds due from homebuyers on the closing of homes 
our mortgages receivable and other receivables relate primarily to land assets we have sold or on which we have granted options to purchase 
since  our revenues and net income have grown at compounded annual growth rates of and  respectively 
over the same period  we generated million in operating cash flow that was used mainly to improve our net debt to capitalization ratio from a high at the end of of to as of december  at the same time  we believe we have positioned our business for future growth through the selective acquisition of a significant number of large projects and our overall level of lots controlled 
our recent growth is primarily the result of strong economic fundamentals in the markets in which we operate  our success in acquiring strategic parcels of land and in controlling costs at all levels of our operation

year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million over the year ended december  our increase in earnings in was primarily a result of the bulk sale of  lots in southern california which contributed net income of million compared to nil in excluding the bulk sale of lots  our earnings from core operations increased to million from million  an increase of 
the increase was primarily a result of continued strong market conditions in all our markets 
revenues housing revenues were million in  an increase of million or compared with the increase was principally a result of a increase in the average selling price from home closings  offset by fewer home closings than the higher average selling price from home closings in was a result of product mix and price appreciation in the markets in which we operate 
the decrease in home closings was largely the result of fewer active projects in our southland los angeles operation 
land and other revenues were million in compared with million in the increase was primarily a result of the bulk sale of lots in southern california generating revenue of million 
our land revenues may vary significantly from period to period as the timing and nature of land sales generally occur on an opportunistic basis 
equity in earnings from housing and land joint ventures equity in earnings from housing and land joint ventures increased to million in  an increase of million over the increase was primarily a result of a bulk land sale of lots in southern california  which contributed earnings of million 
gross margin gross margin was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the gross margin percentage on housing revenue was in compared to in the gross margin percentage in on land and other revenues was compared to in the increase was a result of strong market conditions in southern california  the area where the majority of this revenue was generated 
the components of gross margin are as follows year ended december housing land and other revenues equity in earnings from housing and land joint ventures we believe our housing gross margin percentage will grow in the short term as we commence the closing of homes in a number of projects which recently received final development approvals 
other expenses selling  general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million or over this increase was primarily a result of additional active projects and an increase in stock option expense of million over selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of housing revenue was in compared to in interest expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the lower percentage in was primarily a result of our decrease in leverage 
given that we capitalize interest costs to projects  the level of interest expense may vary from period to period as a result of the mix of projects with home closings 
sales activity net new orders were  units in  an increase of units compared with the increase was primarily a result of additional active projects and continued strong market conditions in all our markets 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income net income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million over our growth in earnings was primarily the result of strong market conditions in all of our markets  including the san francisco bay area  which rebounded from the soft market conditions of revenues housing revenue for the year ended december  increased over  principally a result of a increase in the average selling price from homes closed  offset by fewer home closings than in the increase in the average selling price was principally a result of product mix  continued price appreciation in our markets and a higher level of closings in from our san francisco bay area and southland los angeles operations  where our average selling price is the highest 
our san diego riverside operation accounted for the primary decline in home closings with three active projects in compared with six active projects in land and other revenues totaled million  a decrease of million from the decrease resulted from the sale of fewer lots in the amount of land revenues may vary significantly from period to period as the timing and the nature of land sales generally occur on an opportunistic basis 
equity in earnings from housing and land joint ventures equity in earnings from housing and land joint ventures for the years ended december  was million compared with million in the increase was primarily a result of the commencement of home closings in our fullerton joint venture in the southland los angeles area 
gross margin gross margin for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million or over our gross margin percentage was in  consistent with in our average gross margin since is 
we believe our future average gross margin percentages will be higher than our historical average as we close homes or sell lots in a number of projects which recently received final development approvals 
other expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of housing revenue were in consistent with  and consistent with target levels of 
interest expense as a percentage of total revenue was compared with in given that we capitalize interest costs to our projects  the level of interest expense may vary from period to period as a result of the mix of projects with home closings 
interest expense as a percentage of revenue is targeted between and 
this is higher than many of our competitors which reflects our greater leverage in recent years 
our interest costs in were million compared with million in sales activity net new orders reached  units in  an increase of compared with  units in sales were strong in all of our markets in  most notably in the san francisco bay area where the company s sales increased by over last year 
sales in the southland los angeles market were lower  primarily a result of a decrease in the active selling communities from in to in our backlog of unit sales as of december  was units  which is comparable with liquidity and capital resources financial position our total assets as of december  were  million  compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase in was primarily a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million offset by lower levels of housing and land inventory 
total assets as of december  were comparable with december  our total debt as of december  was million  comparable with december  total debt as of december  consisted mainly of project specific financings which represent construction and development loans that are repaid from home and lot sales proceeds 
as new homes are constructed  further loan facilities are arranged on a rolling basis 
our major project specific lenders are bank of america  housing capital corporation and wells fargo 
other debt comprises deferred compensation on which interest is paid at prime 
as of december   the average interest rate on our debt was with maturities as follows maturities millions post total san francisco bay area southland los angeles san diego riverside northern virginia other total cash flow our principal uses of working capital include purchases of land  land development and home construction 
cash flows for each of our communities depend upon the applicable stage of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  site approvals and entitlements  construction of model homes  roads  certain utilities and other amenities and general landscaping 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during such early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
later  cash flow can significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of sales includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
cash provided by our operating activities totaled million in compared with cash provided of million in the increase in cash generated was primarily the result of the bulk sale of lots in southern california which generated cash proceeds of million 
cash provided by our investing activities in joint ventures for the year ended december  was million compared with cash provided of million in the decrease in cash flow from joint ventures is due to an investment of million in a joint venture in riverside  california representing  lots 
cash used in our financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with cash used of million in our use of cash in related primarily to the repurchase of  common shares for million  common share dividends of million and minority interest distributions of million 
we also fully repaid million of subordinated debt and increased our project specific and other financing by million which currently has an average interest rate of 
deferred tax our company was formed in the course of a reorganization in by brookfield properties of its united states homebuilding operations and was withdrawn from the brookfield properties consolidated group 
the tax provisions that apply in connection with the reorganization  including the departure of a member from a consolidated group  are detailed and complex and are therefore subject to uncertainty 
our tax attributes are based upon estimates which will not ultimately be determined until after december   as well as tax attributes of certain members of the existing consolidated group that have not been reviewed by tax authorities 
we believe we have been prudent and reasonable to provide for any reduction in our net operating losses or loss of tax basis in properties 
contractual obligations and other commitments we generally fund the development of our communities through the use of project specific financings 
as of december   we had available project specific debt lines of million that were available to complete land development and construction activities 
as of december   we also had available cash and cash equivalents of million 
a total of million of our project specific and other financings mature prior to the end of our high level of maturities in and is due to our expected project completions over this period 
although the level of our maturing debt is high  we expect to generate cash flow from our assets in and to repay these obligations 
our net debt to total capitalization ratio as of december   which is defined as total interest bearing debt less cash divided by total interest bearing debt less cash plus stockholders equity and minority interest  was  a significant decrease from as of december  for a description of the specific risks facing us if  for any reason  we are unable to meet these obligations  refer to the section of this form k entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors our debt and leverage could adversely affect our financial condition 
in connection with our project specific financings  we are required to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million 
tangible net worth is defined as the sum of stockholders equity and minority interest 
in addition  our project specific financings require us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of no greater than 
this ratio is defined as total liabilities excluding subordinated debt  divided by total assets 
our project specific financings also require us to maintain a debt to tangible net worth ratio of to this ratio is defined as total debt excluding subordinated debt  divided by stockholders equity plus subordinated debt and minority interest 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  follows payment due by period less than more than total year years years years project specific and other financings operating lease obligations total off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we use lot option contracts and joint ventures to acquire control of land to mitigate the risk of declining land values 
option contracts for the purchase of land permit us to control lots for an extended period of time  until options expire and or we are ready to construct homes or sell the land 
this reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings 
as of december   we had million of primarily non refundable option deposits and advanced costs 
the total exercise price of these options is million 
pursuant to fin r  as defined elsewhere in this form k  we have consolidated million of these option contracts 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional information on our lot options 
we also control  lots through joint ventures 
as of december   our investment in housing and land joint ventures was million 
we have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt in our joint ventures 
as of december   we had recourse guarantees of million and limited maintenance guarantees of million with respect to debt in our joint ventures 
we obtain letters of credit  performance bonds and other bonds to support our obligations with respect to the development of our projects 
the amount of these obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with our development activities 
if these letters of credit or bonds are drawn upon  we will be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bonds 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding and million in performance bonds for these purposes 
we do not believe that any of these letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
stock repurchase program in february  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up to million of brookfield homes outstanding common shares 
during the year ended december   we had repurchased  of our shares at an average cost of per share 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements of our company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are those that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and require the most subjectivity and estimates by our management 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our company included elsewhere in this form k 
capitalized costs our housing and land inventory on our consolidated balance sheet includes the costs of acquiring land  development costs  interest  property taxes and overhead directly related to the development of the land and housing 
these costs are allocated to each lot in proportion to our anticipated revenue 
estimates of costs to complete homes and prepare lots for sale are recorded at the time of closing homes 
if our estimates of costs are significantly different from our actual results  our housing and land inventory may be over or under stated on our balance sheet  and accordingly gross margins in a particular period may be over or under stated 
carrying values housing and land assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
to arrive at this amount  we estimate the cash flow for the life of each project 
these projections take into account the specific business plans for each project  and our estimate of the most probable set of economic conditions anticipated to prevail in the market area 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  they are then written down to the fair value less estimated selling costs 
the ultimate fair values for our housing and land inventory are dependent upon future market and economic conditions 
if our estimate of the future cash flows is significantly different from our actual cash flows  we may prematurely impair the value of the asset  we may underestimate the value of the calculated impairment or we may fail to record an impairment 
in these cases  our housing and land inventory would be represented on our balance sheet at other than its cost or fair value  which could have an effect on our gross margin in future periods as we develop and sell the assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities 
this statement includes the restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and one time benefit arrangements received by employees who are involuntarily terminated nullifying the guidance under eitf under sfas  the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized in the periods in which it is incurred rather than at the date we committed to the exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the provisions of eitf shall continue to apply for exit plans initiated prior to the adoption of sfas the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
interpretation expands on the accounting guidance of sfas  accounting for contingencies  sfas  related party disclosures  and sfas  disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
interpretation also incorporates  without change  the provisions of fasb interpretation  disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which it supersedes 
interpretation does identify several situations where the recognition of a liability at inception for a guarantor s obligation is not required 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosures are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have provided the required disclosures in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of sfas on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in particular  it clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying derivative  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
sfas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of sfas by our company has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
some of the provisions of this statement are consistent with the current definition of liabilities in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
the remaining provisions of this statement are consistent with the proposal to revise that definition to encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle by issuing its own equity shares  depending on the nature of the relationship established between the holder and the issuer 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas by our company has not had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued revised interpretation fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities vies  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  and replaces the previous version of fasb interpretation issued in january  fin 
this interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january  a company that holds a variable interest in a vie it acquired before february  shall apply the provision of this interpretation no later than the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after march  unless those entities are considered to be special purpose entities in which the application is to be no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  this interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
we applied the provision of this new pronouncement effective january  but did not restate any previously issued financial statements 
the decision whether to consolidate a vie begins with establishing that a vie exists 
a vie exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself  or the equity investor lacks one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest 
those characteristics are the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity  and the right to receive the expected residual returns 
the entity with the majority of the expected losses or expected residual return is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the entity and is required to consolidate such entity 
we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of certain vies which are presented in our consolidated financial statements under the item consolidated land inventory not owned  with the interest of others included in minority interest 
see notes and of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for further discussion on the consolidation of land options contracts and joint ventures 
seasonality and quarterly information we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business and the timing of new community openings and the closing out of projects 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first six months of the calendar year 
new home deliveries trail new home orders by several months  therefore we normally have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year 
as a result  our revenues from deliveries of homes are generally higher in the second half of the year 
the following table presents a summary of our operating results for each of the last eight quarters december september june march millions  except home closings and per share amounts total revenue gross margin contribution from bulk land sales to net income net income diluted earnings per share home closings units total assets total debt earnings per share was calculated based on the weighted average number of brookfield properties common shares outstanding during each respective period up to september   adjusted on the basis of one of our common shares for every five common shares of brookfield properties 
for the periods october  to december   earnings per share was calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of brookfield homes outstanding during this period 
non arms length transactions we have entered into a license agreement with brookfield properties us inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of brookfield properties  for the right to use the names brookfield and brookfield homes 
brookfield homes holdings inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  has entered into an agreement with brookfield properties us inc with respect to shared services 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of brascan  our largest stockholder under which we can deposit cash on a demand basis to earn libor plus basis points 
at december   the amount on deposit was million 
for details of these arrangements and other non arms length transactions refer to certain relationships and related party transactions  which is incorporated by reference into item of this report from our definitive proxy statement  which will be filed with the securities and exchange commission not later than april  forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the united states federal securities laws

reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results to differ materially from the anticipated future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements

except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
risk factors this section describes the material risks associated with an investment in our common stock 
stockholders should carefully consider each of the risks described below and all of the other information in this form k 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
in such an event  the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline substantially  and stockholders may lose all or part of the value of their shares of our common stock 
our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected by weakness in general economic  real estate and other conditions 
the residential homebuilding and land development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing for homebuyers  interest rates  consumer confidence and housing demand 
in addition  significant supply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and used homes  may depress prices and reduce margins for the sale of new homes 
homebuilders are also subject to risks related to the availability and cost of materials and labor  and adverse weather conditions that can cause delays in construction schedules and cost overruns 
furthermore  the market value of undeveloped land  buildable lots and housing inventories held by us can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and real estate market conditions 
if there are significant adverse changes in economic or real estate market conditions  we will have to sell homes at a loss or hold land in inventory longer than planned 
inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market 
we may be particularly affected by changes in local market conditions in california  where we derive a large proportion of our revenue 
rising mortgage rates will discourage people from buying new homes 
virtually all of our customers finance their home acquisitions through lenders providing mortgage financing 
mortgage rates are currently at or near their lowest levels in many years 
increases in mortgage rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could depress the market for new homes because of the increased monthly mortgage costs to potential homebuyers 
even if potential customers do not need financing  changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their homes to potential buyers who need financing  which would result in reduced demand for new homes 
as a result  rising mortgage rates could adversely affect our ability to sell new homes and the price at which we can sell them 
laws and regulations related to property development and related to the environment subject us to additional costs and delays which adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we must comply with extensive and complex regulations affecting the homebuilding and land development process 
these regulations impose on us additional costs and delays  which adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in particular  we are required to obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities regulating matters such as permitted land uses  levels of density  the installation of utility services  zoning and building standards 
we must also comply with a variety of local  state and federal laws and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment  including with respect to hazardous or toxic substances 
these environmental laws sometimes result in delays  cause us to incur additional costs  or severely restrict land development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 
if we are not able to develop and market our master planned communities successfully  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
before a master planned community generates any revenues  material expenditures are incurred to acquire land  obtain development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure  amenities  model homes and sales facilities 
it generally takes several years for a master planned community development to achieve cumulative positive cash flow 
if we are unable to develop and market our master planned communities successfully and to generate positive cash flows from these operations in a timely manner  it will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
difficulty in retaining qualified trades workers  or obtaining required materials and supplies  will adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties in the supply of materials and services  including with respect to shortages of qualified trades people  labor disputes  shortages of building materials  unforeseen environmental and engineering problems  and increases in the cost of certain materials particularly increases in the price of lumber  wall board and cement  which are significant components of home construction costs 
when any of these difficulties occur  it causes delays and increases the cost of constructing our homes 
we sometimes face liabilities when we act as a general contractor  and we are sometimes responsible for losses when we hire general contractors 
where we act as the general contractor  we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including work assigned to subcontractors 
claims may be asserted against us for construction defects  personal injury or property damage caused by the subcontractors  and if successful these claims give rise to liability 
where we hire general contractors  if there are unforeseen events like the bankruptcy of  or an uninsured or under insured loss claimed against our general contractors  we sometimes become responsible for the losses or other obligations of the general contractors 
if we are not able to raise capital on favorable terms  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we operate in a capital intensive industry and require significant capital expenditures to maintain our competitive position 
the failure to secure additional debt or equity financing or the failure to do so on favorable terms will limit our ability to grow our business  which in turn will adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we expect to make significant capital expenditures in the future to enhance and maintain the operations of our properties and to expand and develop our real estate inventory 
if our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  or if our cash flow from operations proves to be insufficient due to unanticipated expenses or otherwise  we will likely seek to minimize cash expenditures and or obtain additional financing in order to support our plan of operations 
if sufficient funding  whether obtained through public or private debt  equity financing or from strategic alliances is not available when needed or is not available on acceptable terms  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
our debt and leverage could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are leveraged  and also guarantee shortfalls under some of our bond debt service agreements  when the revenues  fees and assessments which are designed to cover principal and interest and other operating costs of the bonds are not paid 
our leverage could have important consequences  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes  some of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which will expose us to the risk of increased interest rates  and our substantial leverage may limit our flexibility to adjust to changing economic or market conditions  reduce our ability to withstand competitive pressures and make us more vulnerable to a general economic downturn 
we finance each of our projects individually 
as a result  to the extent we increase the number of our projects and our related investment  our total debt obligations may increase 
we repay the principal of our debt from the proceeds of home closings  and as a result our annual debt service is equal to the interest that accrues on our debt 
based on our debt levels as of december   a change up or down in interest rates could have either a positive or negative effect of approximately million on our cash flows 
refer also to the section of this form k entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks interest rates 
if any of these conditions occur  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
in addition  our various debt instruments contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds that we might need in the future 
our business and results of operations will be adversely affected if poor relations with the residents of our communities negatively impact our sales 
as a master planned community developer  we are sometimes expected by community residents to resolve any issues or disputes that arise in connection with the development of our communities 
our sales will likely be negatively affected if any efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes are unsatisfactory to the affected residents  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  our business and results of operations would be adversely affected if we are required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of these issues or disputes  or to modify our community development plans 
our business is susceptible to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters 
the homebuilding industries in california and northern virginia are susceptible to  and are significantly affected by  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  floods and fires 
these adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can cause delays and increased costs in the construction of new homes and the development of new communities 
if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms  or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses resulting from adverse weather or natural disasters  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
in addition  damage to new homes caused by adverse weather or a natural disaster can cause our insurance costs to increase 
increased insurance risk adversely affects our business 
due in part to the terrorist activities of september  and other recent events  we are confronting reduced availability of  and generally lower limits for  insurance against some of the risks associated with our business 
some of the other actions that have been or could be taken by insurance companies include increasing insurance premiums  requiring higher self insured retention and deductibles  requiring additional collateral on surety bonds  imposing additional exclusions  such as with respect to sabotage and terrorism  and refusing to underwrite certain risks and classes of business 
the imposition of any of the preceding actions have and will continue to adversely affect our ability to obtain appropriate insurance coverages at reasonable costs 
residential homebuilding is a competitive industry  and competitive conditions adversely affect our results of operations 
the residential homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
residential homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers  but also for desirable properties  financing  building materials and labor 
we compete with other local  regional and national homebuilders  often within larger communities designed  planned and developed by such homebuilders 
any improvement in the cost structure or service of our competitors will increase the competition we face 
competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  increased selling incentives  lower sales volumes and prices  increased construction costs  and delays in construction 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  which could depress the price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could delay  defer or prevent a change of control of our company or our management 
these provisions  which include authorizing the board of directors to issue preferred stock and limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law which could delay  deter or prevent us from entering into an acquisition  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder unless specific conditions are met 
the existence of any of the above factors could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of shares of our common stock could be adversely affected because brascan corporation owns approximately of our common stock 
brascan corporation owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
if brascan should decide in the future to sell any of our shares owned by it  the sale or the perception of the market that a sale may occur could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
the trading price of shares of our common stock could fluctuate significantly 
the trading price of shares of our common stock in the open market cannot be predicted 
the trading price could fluctuate significantly in response to factors such as variations in our quarterly or annual operating results and financial condition  changes in government regulations affecting our business  the announcement of significant events by us or our competitors  market conditions specific to the homebuilding industry  changes in general economic conditions  differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  the depth and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock  investor perception of the homebuilding industry  events in the homebuilding industry  investment restrictions  and our dividend policy 
in addition  securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock
