overview synthetech is a fine chemicals company specializing in organic synthesis  biocatalysis and chiral technologies 
synthetech develops and manufactures amino acid derivatives  specialty amino acids  peptide fragments  and proprietary custom chiral intermediates primarily for the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries 
synthetech s products support the development and manufacture of therapeutic peptides and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs at every stage of a customer s clinical development pipeline 
synthetech s domestic and international customer base includes major pharmaceutical and emerging biopharmaceutical companies  as well as contract drug synthesis firms 
synthetech also supplies catalog quantities of specialty amino acids to research institutions  universities and drug discovery firms 
our integrated grams to tons production capabilities allow us to be involved with our customers from the early phases of pharmaceutical discovery and clinical development through approval  market launch and commercialization 
synthetech continued to face difficult market conditions in fiscal several pharmaceutical companies have been faced with soft late stage product pipelines and an erosion of their product base as patents lapse on marketed products and these products face competition from generic suppliers 
global pharmaceutical company mergers have resulted in a disruption in customer relationships  the consolidation of development projects and increasing pricing pressures on suppliers 
these factors have created an environment marked by overcapacity and resulting competitive pressures 
additionally  low cost suppliers from emerging economies have developed an expanding position in the pharmaceutical supply chain and further increased competition 
management believes that the new product development sector of the pharmaceutical industry remains active 
synthetech is participating in a variety of early stage projects  which have traditionally been the source for our future large scale projects 
in addition  we continue to supply products for marketed pharmaceuticals and a marketed cosmeceutical 
the progress and timing of development projects and continued success of marketed products remain outside our control 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of synthetech s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires synthetech to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  synthetech evaluates its estimates  including those related to deferred tax asset realization  inventory realization  allowance for doubtful accounts and long lived asset impairments 
synthetech bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
synthetech believes the following are among the critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates that affect the preparation of its financial statements 
see also note b to the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts a customer s creditworthiness is analyzed by a review of a customer s payment history and financial stability 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established by a review of aged accounts receivables and a review for collectibility of specific accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march  and was  for the three years ended march   synthetech s provision for credit losses was insignificant 
if circumstances related to a specific customer change  synthetech s estimate of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on the first in first out fifo basis 
costs include direct material  direct labor  applicable manufacturing overhead  and other direct costs 
management evaluates synthetech s inventory for impairment whenever it becomes aware that indicators of impairment exist 
factors contributing to inventory impairment include  but are not limited to decreases in selling price  changes in customer specifications  project terminations or holds  variations in material produced by synthetech from customer specifications  and production costs materially in excess of current market price 
it is our policy to write down inventories to reflect an estimate for impairment in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  an additional inventory write down may be required in the future 
write downs of inventory are reported as a component of cost of revenue in the relevant period 
long lived asset impairment synthetech monitors the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment 
an impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted cash flows from as asset s use including any proceeds from disposition are less than the asset s carrying value and the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
changes in the expected use of a long lived asset  and the financial performance of the long lived asset  are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment 
future cash flow value may include appraisals for property  plant and equipment  future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets and other operating considerations 
based on this analysis  synthetech did not recognize an impairment to long lived assets during the current period 
revenue recognition synthetech recognizes revenue  including shipping and handling charges billed to customers  when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  synthetech s price to our customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of revenue 
operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue represented by each item included in the statements of operations 
percentage of revenue for the year ended march  revenue cost of revenue gross income loss research and development selling  general and administrative operating expense operating loss interest income interest expense loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss revenue synthetech s revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal changes in revenue for the specified periods primarily relate to revenue from large scale customer projects 
revenue from large scale customer projects was million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
large scale project revenue for fiscal consisted of four customer projects 
two of the fiscal large scale projects support marketed products and were also large scale projects in both fiscal and of these two projects  one achieved marketing approval in the united states and europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the other project supports a marketed cosmeceutical  which is a product that makes no therapeutic claims but is intended for topical use by humans 
the third large scale project for fiscal  which was also a large scale project for  is for a major pharmaceutical company in support of a drug development project in clinical trials 
the fourth large scale project for fiscal is also in support of a drug development project in clinical trials 
a major source of large scale project revenue in both fiscal and fiscal related to a drug that was in phase clinical trials and subsequently progressed to phase testing 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  synthetech experienced a substantial price decline on this project  which was our largest large scale customer project in fiscal the customer had no requirements for additional material in fiscal fiscal customer requirements  if any  for this product are dependent on future outcomes of phase clinical trials and timing of the customer s drug development efforts 
in addition to large scale projects  a significant number of other customer projects contributed to our revenue during fiscal  and while individually smaller in dollar value  these projects support a wide variety of programs for our major pharmaceutical  emerging biopharmaceutical and contract drug synthesis customers 
international revenue  mainly from europe  was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
international sales  like all of our revenue  are subject to significant period to period fluctuations 
synthetech estimates that in fiscal  approximately of product sales went into drugs in clinical trials  approximately went into marketed drugs and the cosmeceutical and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
we estimate that in fiscal  approximately of product sales went into drugs in clinical trials  approximately went into marketed drugs and the cosmeceutical and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
we estimate that in fiscal  approximately of product sales went into drugs in clinical trials  approximately went into marketed drugs and the cosmeceutical and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
these estimates are based on an analysis of our sales  publicly available information and information to the extent available from customers 
our backlog of customer orders at march  and was million 
approximately million of the march  backlog is in support of large scale customer projects 
to the extent successful customer projects develop into larger volumes  either during late stage clinical trials  pre launch or as a marketed product  synthetech s per unit pricing may decline 
there is a risk that the impact on future sales and profitability from declines in pricing may not be offset by an increase in volume 
the level of synthetech s business from period to period is largely unpredictable 
although revenue associated with marketed products is more likely to provide a longer term  on going revenue stream than revenue associated with drugs at the clinical or discovery stages  continuation of customer demand for our products from customers with marketed products remains subject to various market conditions  including potential use of alternative manufacturing methods  continued market demand for drugs or cosmeceuticals that we support  and competition from other suppliers 
accordingly  while significant orders related to marketed products provide substantial and more predictable revenue  we expect revenue to continue to fluctuate from period to period 
gross income loss cost of revenue in fiscal was million  resulting in gross income of  cost of revenue in fiscal was million  resulting in a gross income of million 
cost of revenue in fiscal was million  resulting in a gross loss of  as a percentage of revenue  gross income loss margins were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross income in fiscal was less than gross income in fiscal due to a less favorable product mix on lower revenue 
results for fiscal benefited from a product mix with an unusually high gross income  which synthetech would not normally expect to achieve at comparable levels of revenue 
charges for impaired inventory in fiscal totaled  compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  synthetech incurred a loss on the retirement of equipment of  compared to  in fiscal the improvement in gross income between fiscal and fiscal relates to an improved product mix and a reduction in depreciation expense relating to the extension of asset lives  partially offset by unfavorable adjustments for impaired inventory  as discussed below 
at the beginning of fiscal  synthetech reassessed the useful lives of certain of its machinery and equipment 
the resulting extension in asset lives decreased depreciation expense which increased gross income for fiscal and by approximately million and million  respectively 
see note d to the attached financial statements 
gross income loss for fiscal  and include charges for impaired inventory of  million and  respectively 
synthetech routinely develops manufacturing processes to produce new products or to refine procedures for existing products 
it is not unusual for manufacturing costs associated with new processes to exceed the selling price for the initial batches of product  which results in an inventory write off 
the international fine chemicals industry  where synthetech is a niche participant  has been marked by overcapacity and a resulting downward pressure on pricing 
it remains difficult to rework certain materials on a cost effective basis 
cost of revenue includes raw materials  direct labor  manufacturing overhead  other direct costs  and adjustments to inventory 
operating expenses research and development r d expense in fiscal was  or of revenue  compared to  also of revenue  and  or of revenue  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in r d expense for fiscal  compared to is due to the transfer of personnel from our r d department to our process support department  a component of cost of revenue  a reduction in outside technical services and an increase in r d department resources allocated to the manufacture of small scale products  which reallocation is reported as part of cost of revenue when sold 
these decreases in fiscal r d expenditures compared to fiscal were partially offset by increases in equipment maintenance  depreciation and supplies 
between fiscal and  synthetech expanded and modernized its r d facility and added chemists to better support critical customer programs 
synthetech s r d department develops processes to produce and optimize the production of our products and their related scale up to manufacturing quantities 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense in fiscal was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  in fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal sg a expense was substantially similar to fiscal however  during fiscal  synthetech expanded its sales and marketing efforts through the use of consultants and during the fourth quarter hired a director of business development for europe 
these fiscal cost increases were partially offset by savings related to a temporary vacancy in a senior administrative position and salary reductions implemented in september the increase in sg a expense for fiscal compared to fiscal includes severance costs related to the retirement of an officer  general increases in compensation and related employee benefit costs  increased costs related to professional services and increased expenditures for marketing programs 
sg a expense consists of compensation and related fringe benefits for sales and administrative employees  cost of professional services  marketing costs  costs associated with being a public company and costs related to administrative facilities and information services 
interest income interest income in fiscal was  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
synthetech s interest income is primarily derived from earnings on our cash equivalents 
the changes in interest income for the years presented were due to the amount of cash equivalents and the interest rates in effect during the periods 
average rates of interest earned on cash equivalents were in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense in fiscal was  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
benefit for income taxes for fiscal  synthetech generated net deferred tax assets enabling the utilization of a  net deferred tax liability  which was reported as a benefit for income taxes in the statement of operations 
based on synthetech s recent history of losses  our near term outlook and management s evaluation of available tax planning strategies  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that synthetech will be unable to recognize its net deferred tax assets as a benefit for income taxes  continuing for an uncertain period of time 
for fiscal and  synthetech recorded a benefit for income taxes at the statutory combined federal and state rate of 
net loss net loss for fiscal was million  compared to net losses of  and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the extension of the useful lives of certain machinery and equipment  as discussed above and in note d to the attached financial statements  decreased net loss for fiscal and by approximately million  or per share  and approximately  or per share  respectively 
industry factors market factors the market for synthetech s products is driven by the market for the drugs into which they are incorporated 
the drug development process is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
synthetech has no control over the pace of these drug development efforts  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the fda or  even if approved  the ultimate market potential of the drugs 
synthetech also manufactures products for use in a cosmeceutical  and faces similar factors in that market 
the three stages of the drug development process include r d or discovery stage  clinical trial stage and marketed drug stage 
synthetech s customers can spend years researching and developing new drugs  and take only a small percentage to clinical trials and fewer yet to commercial market 
a substantial amount of activity continues to occur at the earlier stages of r d and clinical trials 
the market for peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs is still developing 
recurring sales of our products for development programs are sporadic 
because of the high cancellation rate for drug development programs  there is a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level and timing of customer orders relating to specific drug development programs vary substantially from period to period and we cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
the size of customer orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
sales of synthetech s products for marketed drugs may provide an opportunity for continuing  longer term sales 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including price  side effects and the existence of competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of synthetech s control  affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for synthetech s products 
also  industry cost pressures can cause pharmaceutical companies to explore and ultimately adopt alternative manufacturing processes that may not include synthetech s products as an intermediate 
the international fine chemicals industry  where synthetech is a niche participant  has been marked by overcapacity and a resulting downward pressure on pricing 
with longer term  significant or large scale orders  we expect increased competition to supply these products 
similar dynamics affect the cosmeceutical development process and market  except that the regulatory oversight and  consequently  the typical length of a product s time to market are reduced 
due to the foregoing industry factors synthetech cannot predict future demand beyond its current order base  and existing orders may be subject to cancellation or delay by customers 
until there is stable demand for our products  we are likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our periodic results 
production factors synthetech has a full cycle grams to tons production capability and has made over products 
with over years of experience  synthetech has developed extensive process technology and is recognized as one of the leaders in our area of expertise 
nevertheless  initial batches of new products and scaling up production processes for existing products may result in significantly lower than expected yields and extended processing time  and may require substantial rework to meet the required customer specifications 
these factors could cause increased costs and delayed shipments  either of which could negatively affect periodic operating results 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources synthetech s cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   compared to million and million at march  and  respectively 
during the past three years  although synthetech has incurred a cumulative net loss of million  we have generated cash from operating activities of million  offset by investments in property plant and equipment totaling million 
synthetech has not undertaken any significant external financing activities during this period 
at march   synthetech had working capital of million  compared to million and million at march  and march   respectively 
during the third quarter of fiscal  synthetech entered into a new million line of credit with a bank 
interest is payable at the prime rate with an annual facility fee of percent 
the facility is collateralized by cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  inventories and equipment 
financial covenants contained in the agreement require synthetech to maintain a quick ratio of to and a tangible net worth of million 
synthetech had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of march  the credit facility expires in december synthetech used cash in our operating activities of million in fiscal  compared to cash generated from operating activities of million and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the primary use of cash from operating activities was the net loss as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  and changes in working capital levels  including accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
accounts receivable increased to million at march  from  at march  primarily due to differences in the timing and the amount of shipments between the periods 
inventory increased to million at march  from million at march  primarily due to an increase in finished product to support future shipments 
accounts payable decreased to  at march  from  at march   primarily due to timing differences in expenditures related to capital projects 
synthetech used  of cash for capital expenditures in fiscal  compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
synthetech s capital plan for fiscal calls for various projects totaling approximately  synthetech expects to finance all capital expenditures from cash on hand and any internal cash flow and does not anticipate the need for any new debt or equity financing to fund these projects 
synthetech generated cash from financing activities in fiscal of  compared to  in fiscal and cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal proceeds from the exercise of employee and director stock options and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan in fiscal totaled  which was partially offset by principal payments pursuant to a long term debt obligation of  on march   synthetech s board approved a share repurchase program and authorized the purchase of up to  shares of company common stock in the open market over the succeeding year 
no shares were repurchased under the program and the authorization to repurchase shares of company common stock has expired 
synthetech believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  its bank line of credit and any funds generated from operations will be sufficient to support its operations for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table presents information regarding synthetech s known contractual obligations to third parties at march  for the year ended march  thereafter total in thousands debt maturities operating lease obligations purchase obligations off balance sheet arrangements synthetech has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk synthetech s primary market risk exposure is the impact of interest rate fluctuations on interest income earned on our cash equivalents 
the risks associated with market  liquidity and principal are mitigated by investing in high credit quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity dates 
synthetech does not invest in derivative financial instruments 
substantially all of synthetech s purchases and sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to any of its purchases and sales 
should synthetech enter into a significant transaction denominated in a foreign currency  we may enter into a forward exchange contract at that time 
synthetech was not a party to any forward exchange contracts as of march  for existing company transactions denominated in a foreign currency  the effect of an immediate change in relevant exchange rates would not have a material impact on synthetech s operating results or cash flows
