trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased in as a result of the growth in the business  higher obligations for third party sales agent commissions  third party royalties  non income based taxes  increased reserves for legal claims and assessments and increases in other accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding  excluding the effect of million outstanding under the company s million accounts receivable securitization facility  of days was unchanged at december  compared to december  days sales in inventory decreased days to days at december  from days at december  the lower days sales in inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and higher provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches

should additional funds be required  the company had million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities and an additional million of eligible accounts receivable which could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at december  the company s future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year  including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business  are summarized as follows in millions payment period thereafter long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations the company s additional borrowing capacity  along with the expected expiration period of the commitment  are summarized as follows in millions amount of commitment total expiration per period amount less than in excess of committed year year lines of credit standby letters of credit critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates 
estimates are based on historical experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause the company s products to become obsolete 
the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  the company records accruals representing management s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 
other matters the company distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies  in particular the euro and the british pound 
when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the united states dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  france  germany  ireland  switzerland  canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the company s cost of sales 
the company follows the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statements no 
and no 
 in accounting for its derivative financial instruments 
the statements require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not documented and accounted for as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points 
a hypothetical change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million and would have changed the fair value by approximately million 
at december   the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the company is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates as a result of its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility 
the company managed a portion of its interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements  which had fixed the base rate on a million notional amount of the variable rate borrowings during these interest rate swap agreements expired during if market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged more than they did in  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps  would have increased  and earnings before income taxes would have decreased  by million 
by comparison  if market interest rates had averaged less than they did during  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps  would have decreased  and earnings before income taxes would have increased  by million 
if market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged more than they did in  the company s discount expense would have increased  and earnings before income taxes would have decreased  by million 
by comparison  if market interest rates had averaged less than they did in  the company s discount expense would have decreased  and earnings before income taxes would have increased  by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
the company s interest rate swap agreements  which matured over various terms ranging from september through december  effectively converted a portion of its variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on interest expense 
the company designated the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
gains of million and million and a loss of million attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements were recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in  and  respectively 
interest rate differentials paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps were recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings 
the company has used yen denominated floating rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in japan 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge were not included in the consolidated statements of earnings  but were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in stockholders equity 
net gains losses of million  million and million attributable to the yen denominated floating rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in  and  respectively 
the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged 
these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets by million 
this gain eliminated the previously recorded cumulative loss of million that had been deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity at december  on july   the company acquired sdi from tyco international ltd  for million in cash 
the acquisition expanded the company s spinal product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the united states market as well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation devices

the acquisition of sdi was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations for the acquired business are included in the company s consolidated financial statements beginning july  the company s pro forma consolidated financial results in did not differ significantly as a result of the sdi acquisition 
the company is partially self insured for product liability claims 
in  the company established a wholly owned captive insurance company in the us to manage its self insured retention limits 
the captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities 
the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
during the second quarter of  the company issued  shares of restricted stock to its newly appointed president and chief operating officer 
the stock vests ratably on the first five anniversary dates of the grant  provided that the recipient is still employed by the company 
the aggregate market value of the restricted stock at the date of issuance of million  as measured at the quoted price of the company s common stock  has been recorded as deferred stock based compensation  a separate component of stockholders equity  and is being amortized over the five year vesting period 
in december  the company announced that its subsidiary  physiotherapy associates  inc  and stryker received a subpoena from the united states attorney s office in boston  massachusetts  in connection with a department of justice investigation of physiotherapy associates billing and coding practices
