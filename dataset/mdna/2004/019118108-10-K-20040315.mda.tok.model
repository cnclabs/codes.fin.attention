item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands of dollars overview allied is a strategic portfolio of defense and security businesses  with presence in worldwide markets  offering both government and commercial customers leading edge products and services 
allied operates in four principal segments mecar s development and production of ammunition and weapon systems ordnance manufacturing  vsk group s and ns microwave s manufacture  distribution and service of industrial security products electronic security  titan dynamics development and sale of battlefield effects simulators software  training simulation  and seaspace s production and sale of weather and environmental satellite ground reception systems environmental safety security 

table of contents due to the historic volatility in mecar s business  in the mid s allied acquired the vsk group with a goal of attempting to diversify its operations 
the company continued its diversification efforts in late and into mid with the acquisitions of ns microwave  titan dynamics and seaspace 
in  mecar and the vsk group continued to provide excellent revenues and net profits 
mecar achieved above average net profits due in large part to continued work on a large fms contract for the benefit of one of its principal customers 
the vsk group reported record revenues and net profits based on increased export sales of its security services products via its distribution system 
the excellent european results were amplified by the increased value of the euro versus the us dollar but offset by losses incurred by the most recent domestic acquisitions 
allied earned net profits of  per share basic and per share diluted in compared to net profits of  per share basic and per share diluted in and net profits of  per share basic and per share diluted in allied anticipates that will be another profitable year 
the european subsidiaries have healthy backlogs and are expected to deliver substantial profits  although perhaps not at the same levels as in recent years 
allied anticipates that its domestic subsidiaries should perform considerably better in than in in late  allied organized mecar usa  inc  a delaware corporation  to pursue ammunition and related opportunities from us and other markets 
mecar usa will initially focus on contracts for ammunition and pyrotechnics devices 
mecar usa will operate from marshall  texas 
it will commence operations in the fourth quarter of allied enters with substantial cash reserves and anticipates no liquidity concerns in the company continues to pursue a domestic lending facility in order to continue its acquisitions program 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years ended december   and  certain items from allied s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december  revenue cost and expenses cost of sales selling and administrative research and development operating income other income expense interest income interest expense other net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings revenues 
allied s consolidated revenues for increased  or  over the prior year principally due to higher production activities at mecar and the vsk group 
revenues for increased  or  over revenues  again based upon increased activity at mecar and the vsk group during the period 

table of contents revenues by segment millions amount amount amount ordnance manufacturing electronic security environmental safety security software  training simulation ordinance manufacturing segment revenues increased in due to continued performance of the multi year fms contract as well as work on additional orders secured from non traditional customers 
notwithstanding mecar s success in obtaining orders from new customers  approximately of revenues were derived from mecar s traditional customer base 
the positive fluctuation in over ordnance manufacturing segment revenues was caused by work on the fms contract awarded in early electronic security segment revenue increased by in  although the mix was substantially different 
the vsk group contributed  a increase over  largely due to increased sales to non belgian customers 
the vsk group makes sales to such customers via independent sales distributors 
ns microwave s revenues decreased to  many of ns microwave s traditional us government agency customers were reorganized into the department of homeland security 
the organization and startup of the department of homeland security was marked by a delay in award of contracts by these agencies 
while ns microwave began to receive some orders in the fourth quarter of  it was too late to realize meaningful revenues from some of these orders in electronic security segment revenues increased by  in ns microwave was added to the electronic security segment in and contributed  to this amount 
in each of and  ordnance manufacturing and electronic security segment revenues were positively impacted by the stronger euro 
in and  these revenues were so benefited by approximately and  respectively 
environmental safety security segment revenue increased in over revenues as a result of only five months of activity in this segment s revenue in was less than expected due to increased competition by domestic and foreign competitors 
software  training simulation segment revenues increased in inasmuch as revenues included only six months of operations following the june  acquisition of titan dynamics 
revenues continue to be constrained due to the lack of safety certification for the omega b battlefield effects simulator 
testing by the marine corps is substantially complete and titan dynamics is optimistic that it will receive marine corps certification of this product by the end of the third quarter of certification should also accelerate penetration in foreign markets 
further  marine corps certification should facilitate and accelerate certification by the us army 
in  the sales of cartridges represented the majority of titan dynamics sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for was approximately compared with in the increase during was driven by higher costs within the ordnance and manufacturing segment 
the costs were primarily related to the fms contract which dominated the production process in the current year 
additionally  mecar incurred higher than anticipated labor costs due to production delays surrounding a mm production order 
the delay has been resolved and should not affect activity in future periods 
electronic security segment cost of sales decreased from primarily due to the vsk group s production efficiencies realized as it expanded its distribution channel throughout europe 
in particular  the vsk group incurred lower material costs on its export sales to its distributors 
environmental safety security segment cost of sales increased over as a result of higher x band sales  which traditionally have lower margins 
over the past twelve months  the x band market has become much more competitive 
while selling 
table of contents prices were reduced to meet the competition in order to maintain market share  cost of materials remained unchanged 
accordingly  while the number of x band orders is greater this year  the gross margins are lower 
this trend is expected to continue in future years 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for was approximately compared with for the increase in production costs relative to those incurred in was primarily the result of a very favorable development contract in with above average margins 
the majority of the margins generated by this one contract were recognized during the third and fourth quarters of selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for was slightly higher than the ordnance manufacturing segment incurred higher administrative compensation costs 
in the electronic security segment  the vsk group also incurred higher costs that were driven by the increased sales volume 
ns microwave was affected by the funding issues surrounding homeland security spending by the federal government 
administrative costs were also burdened with compensation charges associated with production personnel who had been reassigned to administrative support functions since the beginning of the year 
additionally  the consolidated results were affected by full year contributions by titan dynamics and seaspace 
the company expects selling and administrative expense to continue to increase in proportion to the increase in sales 
selling and administrative expenses in increased by  from the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the additions of ns microwave  titan dynamics and seaspace 
administrative costs at mecar and vsk only increased by approximately from ns microwave was consolidated on a full year basis while titan dynamics and seaspace were second and third quarter additions 
research and development 
research and development costs increased between and the total dollar increases were primarily attributed to increased research conducted at mecar  the vsk group and ns microwave 
this trend is expected to continue 
interest income 
interest income decreased between and income earned on interest bearing accounts throughout the company has been affected by the lower interest rates being earned on such accounts 
interest expense 
interest expense increased between and due principally to the costs associated with a convertible debenture issued in the second quarter of the interest charges on that debenture will continue  on a monthly basis  until the earlier of the instrument being converted into common stock or until the debenture is liquidated 
the debenture is repayable in ten monthly payments commencing on june   and terminating on march  other net 
other net income for decreased by  from  while other net income for increased by  over the fluctuations stemmed primarily from the currency fluctuations at mecar and the vsk group 
in particular  mecar had currency gains in on its us bank accounts 
subsequently  mecar incurred currency losses in on its us bank accounts due the strength of the euro over the past twelve months 
other expense includes bank charges related to mecar s performance bonds and advance payment guarantees 
pre tax profit 
pre tax profit loss by segment ordnance manufacturing electronic security environmental safety security software  training simulation corporate and other 
table of contents mecar has enjoyed several consecutive years of above average profitability 
in  mecar continued to reap the benefits of a large multi year fms contract for the benefit of one of its principal customers 
this contract was also a prime contributor to mecar s profits 
while some work remains on this fms contract  it is not expected to be a substantial contributor to profits 
in  a substantial portion of mecar s profits was earned on a high margin product development contract 
while mecar has a substantial backlog of orders for  it does not have any above average margin contracts similar to those enjoyed in accordingly  mecar s profitability for will likely be less than the amounts earned in the preceding time periods 
profits within the electronic security segment decreased from levels despite record performance by the vsk group 
the vsk group reported  of pre tax profits  which amount was favorably impacted by increased sales to non belgian customers via the vsk group s distribution network 
ns microwave s performance suffered due to continuing delays in award of orders caused in part by the organization of the department of homeland security 
some orders began to be received in the fourth quarter of ns microwave has right sized its workforce for its operations 
the environmental safety security segment results in were disappointing due to increased competitive pressures  both home and abroad 
the company has appointed a new president at seaspace and seaspace has taken efforts to right size its organization and reduce its cost of goods sold in light of the competitive environment 
titan dynamics continues to be adversely impacted since its principal product lacks us government safety certification 
titan dynamics anticipates receipt of marine corps certification in the second or third quarter of the losses incurred by the corporate and other segment increased in due to increased taxes  intercompany management fee adjustments and reduced currency gains 
income taxes 
the effective income tax expense in  and was  and  respectively  primarily due to foreign rate differentials and permanent tax differences 
in  the statutory tax rate for the european subsidiaries was reduced by the belgium parliament from to 
the effective tax rate was adversely affected as a result of increased permanent differences and benefits impacted by the repatriation of dividends by allied from its foreign subsidiaries 
net earnings 
net earnings of  decreased from levels due to losses incurred by allied s domestic subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources balance sheet 
all items on the company s december  consolidated balance sheet were positively affected by the increased value of the euro in all european values were converted at the december  and conversion ratios of and us dollar to euro  respectively 
the following sets forth additional reasons for the fluctuations in the balance sheet items from december  to december  historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations and available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fully fund the company s operational needs 
working capital  which includes restricted cash  was  at december   which is an increase of  over the december   level 
working capital has remained strong since due to profitable operations and the  convertible debenture issued by the company on june  cash including restricted cash increased by  in due to profitable operations and cash collections by mecar and the vsk group  borrowings from short term debt and improved cash flow from operations 
accounts receivable at december   was consistent with the amount at december  costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts increased from year end primarily as a result of work on the fms contract at mecar 
inventories increased  primarily from higher raw material purchases 
the inventory buildup will give the subsidiaries the ability to deliver products with the shortest possible lead times 
fair value of foreign exchange contracts was  at december   compared to  at 
table of contents december  mecar uses foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the foreign currency exposures that arise from sales contracts with certain foreign customers 
prepaid and other current assets increased  primarily from payment of quarterly taxes at mecar 
property  plant equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased primarily from equipment purchases at mecar and the vsk group 
intangibles and goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  increased primarily from the strength of the euro and adjustment of deferred tax related to intangibles purchased in notes payable increased  over as a result of mecar funding its working capital needs 
accounts payable increased  over which is related to the increase in costs on uncompleted contracts 
accrued liabilities increased  due primarily to the costs associated with higher production levels and deferred gains related to forward exchange contracts at mecar 
customer deposits decreased primarily at mecar as a result of shipments during the period and other new contracts in not requiring deposits 
income taxes decreased  due to the tax benefits at ns microwave  seaspace  titan dynamics and corporate  offset by the tax provisions at mecar and the vsk group 
convertible subordinated debenture  current and long term  was only impacted by amortization between december  and december  however  the current and long term allocations changed 
the initial terms called for monthly principal payments  in the amount of  to begin on june   and continue for a period of ten months or until march  additionally  the monthly principal payments were to include interest on the outstanding note balance 
on june   the lender exercised its right to extend the terms of the debenture by twelve months  which impacted the company s current maturity schedule 
stockholders equity at december   was positively affected by profits and increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar during the year by approximately  resulting in accumulated other comprehensive income of  at december  cash flows 
the table below highlights allied s cash flows for the periods listed for the years ended december net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities between and is attributed primarily to growth in earnings  collection of receivables and decreased cash outlays for cost and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts  which are mainly from mecar s and the vsk group s customer base 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities between and stems primarily from the expenditures for work related to the fms contract which was awarded in early cash paid for interest was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash paid for income taxes was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and includes federal  international and state taxes 
cash used in investing activities decreased by  between and this stemmed from cash paid for the titan dynamics and seaspace acquisitions in  with no related acquisition activity in this decrease was offset by a slight increase in capital expenditures due primarily to higher outlays for production equipment and leasehold improvements at the belgian business units 
the acquisitions were the main reason for the  increase in cash used in investing activities between and in addition  capital expenditures were higher in the company anticipates that cash generated from operations and capital leases will be sufficient to support any further capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
future expenditures will be primarily incurred at mecar for machinery and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities decreased between and and increased between and during  the primary source of cash provided by financing activities was the  proceeds realized from the sale of the convertible debenture and warrant 

table of contents allied 
the parent company continues to operate based on fees and dividends received from its subsidiaries 
allied has made cash infusions to ns microwave and titan to support working capital requirements 
to implement its acquisition program  allied has secured dividends from its subsidiaries and in sold a million convertible debenture 
the debenture is repayable in ten monthly installments commencing in june the company anticipates repayment of the debenture from existing cash reserves 
mecar 
mecar continues to operate from internally generated cash and funds provided by its bank syndicate and financing from capital leases 
mecar typically obtains orders for its ammunition and weapon systems that require credit facilities to provide import letters of credit  advance payment guarantees and performance bonds 
these needs have been met in the last few years via agreements with a five member international bank syndicate of which the lead bank is based in belgium 
while the bank syndicate agreement provides that mecar is responsible to repay the syndicate for amounts paid by the banks pursuant to the guarantees bonds  the financial terms stipulate that all such obligations be secured  in part  by a cash pledge 
the bank syndicate agreement provides the banks the right to review and approve each proposed mecar contract before agreeing to provide the necessary letters of credit  guarantee and or bond 
while management believes that it will be able to finance additional mecar contracts using the bank syndicate structure  there can be no assurance that such financing will be unconditionally and permanently provided 
the bank syndicate agreement provides i lines of credit for tax prepayments and working capital and ii a facility for guarantees bonds to support customer contracts 
the financial lending terms and fees are denominated in euros and the dollar equivalents will fluctuate according to global economic conditions 
the revised bank agreement  as executed in march  eliminates most restrictions on cash transfers by mecar to allied or other allied group companies 
however  the agreement imposes two financial covenants requiring mecar to maintain minimum net worth and working capital levels 
as of december   mecar was in compliance with both of these bank covenants 
mecar s obligations under the bank syndicate agreement continue to be collateralized by a pledge of mecar s assets and a mortgage on mecar s facility 
the agreement includes allied s pledge to support mecar so that it remains in compliance with its total borrowing obligations 
vsk group 
the vsk group operated throughout solely from cash generated from business operations 
the vsk group is obligated on several mortgages and other long term obligations 
other subsidiaries 
ns microwave and titan dynamics operated in from cash generated from operations and cash infusions by allied 
seaspace operated in from cash generated from operations and cash reserves 
stock repurchases 
the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in  or and does not anticipate repurchasing shares of company stock in calendar year contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
as described herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  allied has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect its financial condition 
however  based on management s assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of allied  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on allied s financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents the following table identifies material contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period amount in s less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations convertible debenture operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations future liquidity 
the company continues to explore alternate methods of securing the necessary financial capacity to implement its growth plans 
at times  the company has utilized the services of an investment banker in an attempt to secure a senior credit facility for its us based operations 
funds for the build out of the initial mecar usa infrastructure are being provided by the marshall economic development corporation of marshall  texas 
this is a state funded organization with the initial proceeds directed at creating roads and a manufacturing plant on the grounds 
the company s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its continued ability to generate positive cash flow from the operations of its subsidiaries  particularly the operations of mecar and the vsk group  and its ability to successfully integrate its acquisitions 
the company expects its acquisitions to be accretive to operations within months  although this cannot be assured 
this will depend upon many factors including the successful release of new product offerings  successful research and development efforts  and increased market share 
there is no assurance that this goal will be achieved 
completed acquisitions 
see note b to allied s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of completed acquisitions which have affected our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
mecar is required to provide performance bonds and advance payment guarantees for certain contracts  which are provided by mecar s bank syndicate 
at december   mecar s bank syndicate had provided  of such bonds guarantees 
mecar is obligated to repay the bank syndicate any amounts it pays as a result of any demands on the bonds or guarantees 
to date  there have never been any such demands 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note a to allied s consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
allied does not anticipate that any of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial results 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies which affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method goodwill and intangible asset valuation inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on fixed price contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method is used by mecar  ns microwave  and seaspace for substantially all of their fixed price sales contracts 
approximately  and of consolidated revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method during   and  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized on these contracts as work progresses during the period  based on the amount of actual cost incurred during the period compared to total estimated cost to be incurred for the total contract cost to cost method 
management reviews these estimates as work progresses and the effect of any change in cost estimates is reflected in cost of sales in the period in which the change is identified 
if the contract is projected to create a loss  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period such loss first becomes known 
accounting for the profit on a contract requires estimates of the total contract value  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s scope of work  and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the contract value and the estimated total cost at completion 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rates and efficiency variances  material usage variances  revised estimates of warranty costs  delivery schedules and testing requirements 
additionally  as inventory items increase in age  obsolete and excess items are charged to cost of sales if the economic conditions of the future sales potential of that inventory warrant a charge 
while we believe that the systems and procedures used by the subsidiaries  coupled with the experience of their management teams  provide a sound basis for our estimates  actual result will differ from management s estimates 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation 
the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles with definitive lives and other costs 
as of december   the company has million of goodwill recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and did not determine that an impairment charge to earnings was required 
as required by the new rules  the company will perform a similar review each year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future cash flows discounted at the company s weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
if market conditions in these business units fail to meet expectations  it could negatively impact revenue or cost  and could result in charges for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 

table of contents for intangible assets with definitive lives  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset 
as of december   the company had million of intangible assets with definitive lives recorded in other assets  which includes patents  customer lists  trademarks  etc 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to reflect the impairment of these assets 
impairment could also result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if the market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on a first in  first out basis 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods of million as of december  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and the age of the item  and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts are evaluated based upon detailed analysis and assessment of receivables that may not be collected in the normal course of operations 
valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
the company is subject to taxation by federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
the company believes that it has recorded adequate liabilities and reviews those balances on a quarterly basis 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company and the industries in which it operates 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include substantial reliance on mecar s principal customers to continue to acquire mecar s products on a regular basis  the cyclical nature of the company s military business  rapid technological developments and changes and the company s ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  the ability of the company to successfully continue to expand its business base  the mix of products services  domestic and foreign governmental fiscal affairs and public policy changes which may affect the level of purchases made by customers  changes in environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations  general risks associated with doing business outside the united states including  without limitation  import duties  tariffs  quotas and political and economic instability  the effects of terrorist actions on business activities  customer orders and cancellations  and the united states and international governments responses to these terrorist actions  changes in government regulations  liability and other claims assorted against us  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support the company s future business 
these are representative of the future factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions including 
table of contents interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations  increasing competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  and other future factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates changes 
from time to time  we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on a notional amount 
as of december  and  all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate sensitivity 
allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at december   allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end cash available for investment including restricted cash  a change in interest rates would impact net interest income for the years ended december  and by million and less than million  respectively 
exchange rate sensitivity 
allied maintains operations in several foreign countries 
approximately of the company s revenue was derived from operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates associated with some  but not all  of its contracts in which the expenses for providing services are incurred in currency other than the functional currency of allied s foreign subsidiaries or payments on contracts are made by the customer in another currency 
the objective of these contracts is to hedge fixed obligations to reduce the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on allied s foreign subsidiaries operating results 
the notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december  and was million and million  respectively 
a change in the exchange rate of the currencies hedged would change the fair market value of the contracts by approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
additionally  allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the euro would impact reported net earnings for the years ending december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
see note n to the financial statements for more information on financial instruments 
allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
