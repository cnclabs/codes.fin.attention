we deliver digital communications software and services that enable enterprises  government agencies  wireless carriers  and internet and wireline service providers to rapidly deploy highly scalable solutions for messaging and identity management 
built upon an open  extensible software platform  these solutions help organizations expand the range of digital communications services they provide  while helping to reduce overall costs 
our messaging solutions  available both as licensed software and as hosted services  provide integrated access to a broad range of communication and collaboration applications from wireless devices  web browsers  desktop clients  and voice systems 
this integration can provide new revenue opportunities for carriers and service providers and enables them to attract new subscribers  drive more usage  and retain subscribers longer 
for enterprises and governments  our solutions are designed to reduce burdens on helpdesks  simplify the deployment of key security infrastructure  enable easier compliance with new regulatory mandates  and help reduce the cost and effort of deploying modern messaging services to distributed organizations  mobile users  deskless workers  suppliers and customers 
critical path generates revenues from four primary sources licenses for use of our software products 
our various messaging applications are typically licensed by telecommunications carriers  postal and government agencies  and some highly distributed enterprises for deployment in their data centers 
such licenses are usually sold as a perpetual license on a per user basis  one for each person who might access the capabilities provided by the software 
our identity management software is typically licensed by large enterprises  government agencies  and telecommunications carriers and is deployed on site in their data centers 
our identity management software is usually sold as a perpetual license according to the number of data elements and different business systems being managed  our layered applications are usually licensed per user 
annual support and maintenance subscriptions for our licensed software 
we offer a variety of support and maintenance plans that enable customers of our licensed software to receive expedited technical support and access to new releases of our software 
most customers initially subscribe to these services when purchasing our software and then renew their subscriptions on an annual basis 
hosted service subscriptions for access to our messaging and other digital communications applications 
we offer access to email  personal information management  resource scheduling  and newsgroup over the internet and wireless networks for enterprises  telecommunications operators  and  for certain services  
table of contents consumers 
the software powering these services runs in data centers that we jointly operate with the hewlett packard company  unlike with licensed software  customers of these services do not need to install or maintain their own copies of the software 
instead  customers pay initial setup fees and regular monthly  quarterly or annual subscriptions for the services they would like to be able to access 
consulting  training  and professional services 
we offer a range of different services designed to help our customers make more effective use of our products and services 
our licensed messaging and identity management software often require integration with customers existing infrastructure or customization to provide special features or capabilities 
in addition  our consultants offer expertise and experience in designing and delivering new services that customers can use to supplement their own resources 
we generate most of our revenues from telecommunications operators and from large enterprises 
wireless carriers  internet service providers and fixed line service providers purchase our products and services primarily when they are looking to offer new services to their subscribers 
while they also purchase our products and services to lower their cost of operating existing services or infrastructure  their spending is often tied to the level of investment they are willing to make on new revenue generating services 
restructuring initiatives since our inception  we have incurred significant losses  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  inclusive of a billion charge for impairment of long lived assets recorded in the fourth quarter of we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing  development of our technology and solution offerings  and related enhancements 
we may continue to incur operating losses 
see the further discussion on our financial position in the liquidity and capital resources section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during we evaluated our various products  services  facilities and the business plan under which we were operating 
in connection with this review  we implemented and substantially completed a strategic restructuring plan that involved reorganizing and refocusing critical path s product and service offerings  a reduction in workforce and a facilities and operations consolidation 
additionally  we implemented an aggressive expense management plan to further reduce operating costs 
at the end of  we had divested all of the products and services deemed to be non core to our continued operations  reduced headcount by  reduced the number of facilities by and implemented other cost cutting measures  resulting in a significant reduction in overall operating expenses 
in may  we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our expense levels to be consistent with the then current business climate 
in connection with the plan  a restructuring charge of million was recognized in the second quarter of this charge was comprised of approximately million in severance and related costs associated with the elimination of approximately positions and  in facilities lease termination costs 
in january  we announced a restructuring initiative designed to further reduce our expense levels in an effort to achieve operating profitability assuming no or moderate revenue growth 
the plan included the consolidation of some office locations and a global workforce reduction of approximately positions  or approximately of the workforce 
the headcount reduction was partially offset by outsourcing approximately positions to lower cost service providers 
we incurred aggregate charges of approximately million resulting from the cost reduction plan  inclusive of million in cash and million in non cash expenses 
in november  we announced a restructuring of certain of our facility lease obligations in an effort to reduce our long term cash obligations 
in addition  we identified an additional positions  primarily held by management level employees  which were to be eliminated 
costs totaling million were recognized during the fourth quarter of associated with these initiatives  including million in lease restructuring and termination costs and million in severance and related headcount reduction costs 
during the fourth quarter of  cash payments totaling million were made associated with the facility restructuring activities and million related to the headcount reductions 

table of contents in addition to these formal restructuring initiatives  we have sought to aggressively manage our cost structure  identifying incremental savings where possible 
we intend to continue to aggressively manage our expenses in  while maintaining strong service levels to our customers 
in recent months  management has focused on capital financing initiatives in order to maintain our current and planned operations 
our history of losses from operations and cash flow deficits  in combination with our cash balances  raised concerns about our short term ability to fund operations from our existing cash at the time 
consequently  we have secured additional funds through several rounds of financing that involved the sale of senior secured notes convertible into a new series of preferred stock  subject to the approval of our shareholders 
see liquidity and capital resources recent financing transactions below 
owing to the financing activities we undertook in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  management believes that our cash  cash equivalents and available line of credit as of the date of this filing will be sufficient to maintain current and planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  organizational restructuring and limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results  including gross profit margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
at december   we had employees  as compared to employees at december  and employees at december  we do not believe that our historical trends for revenues  expenses or personnel are indicative of future results 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  valuation and impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived from four primary sources software license sales  professional services  maintenance and support and hosted messaging services 
revenues are recognized once the related products or services have been delivered and collection of associated fees is considered probable 
software license revenues are generated from the sale of our messaging and identity management products under perpetual and term licenses 
software license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the licensed software to the customer has occurred and the collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered probable 
our revenue recognition policies require that revenues recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each undelivered element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements  such as post contract customer support  installation  training or other services 
professional service revenues are generated from fees primarily related to training  installation and configuration services associated with implementing and maintaining our license software products for our customers 
professional service revenues are recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
maintenance and support service revenues are generated from fees for post contract customer 
table of contents support agreements associated primarily with our software license products 
maintenance services typically include rights to future update and upgrade product releases and dial up phone services and the associated fees are typically paid up front by the customer  deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support contract  which is generally one year 
we also enter into arrangements that include multiple products and services where the services are deemed essential to the functionality of a delivered element  under such circumstances we recognize the entire arrangement fee using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  individual contract revenues are recorded based on the percentage relationship of the contract costs incurred as compared to management s estimate of the total cost to complete the contract 
we also sell our license software products through resellers 
revenues from reseller agreements may include a nonrefundable  advance royalty which is payable upon the signing of the contract and license fees based on the contracted value of our products purchased by the reseller 
additionally  revenues from reseller agreements may include nonrefundable fees related to software license products and related services for an identified customer of the reseller 
guaranteed license fees from resellers  where no right of return exists  are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the licensed software has occurred and the collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered probable 
non guaranteed per copy license fees from resellers are initially deferred and are recognized when they are reported as sold to end users by the reseller 
hosted messaging revenues are generated from fees for hosting services we offer related to our messaging and collaboration solutions  including but not limited to email  calendar  reserve and news groups 
these are primarily based upon monthly contractual per unit rates for the services involved  which are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract beginning with the month in which service delivery starts 
amounts billed or received in advance of service delivery  including branding and set up fees  are initially deferred and subsequently recognized on a ratable basis over the expected term of the relationship beginning with the month in which service delivery starts 
valuation and impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets finite lived intangible assets are presented at cost  net of accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of the assets  which has historically been between and years 
we will record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets when it determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment  include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in april  we announced a restructuring plan that involved reorganizing our product and service offerings  including eliminating various product and service lines associated with the following acquisitions dotone  fabrik connect service  faxnet  and netmosphere 
as a result of the restructuring  we abandoned all of the technology associated with the products and services and terminated all employees originally acquired from dotone  fabrik  faxnet and netmosphere 
as a result  we determined that an impairment analysis was required during the second quarter of 
table of contents we believed that the termination of the product and service lines indicated that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable and therefore an impairment review was required under sfas no 
when it was determined the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  we measured any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
as no future revenues were to be recognized from the product and service lines that were eliminated  which represented separate asset groupings under sfas no 
 all of the remaining intangible assets associated with the product and service lines were written off in their entirety 
as a result of the assessment  we recorded a million impairment charge in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  as a result of our consolidation of our facilities and asset base related to our previous restructurings  we performed an assessment of our property and equipment balances that related to our existing hosted messaging business line 
as a result of this assessment  we specifically identified assets that it determined were not going to be utilized in the ongoing business and took an impairment charge related to these assets 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of we classified the impairment of existing technology and property and equipment to cost of net revenues  and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as other operating expense 
the impairment charges were allocated to these classifications to conform to the classifications of the amortization charges associated with these assets 
the amortization and impairment charges relating to existing technology and the impaired property and equipment were charged to cost of net revenues as we believe these were the only costs that were directly related to the generation of our revenues 
estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
for this reason  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management must make estimates surrounding their ability to collect revenues and related accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical and current economic trends  previous bad debts  customer concentrations  credit worthiness of customers  and payment terms of customer accounts  when evaluating adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management estimates liabilities and contingencies at the end of each period 
the current financial statement presentation reflects management s best estimates of liabilities and pending litigation which are probable and where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record the minimum liability related to those claims where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management may not be able to make an accurate estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will continue to assess the potential exposure related to our pending litigation and update our estimates and related disclosures 
such future revisions in our estimates could materially impact our financial results 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements shareholders equity deficit 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net loss  as some options granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options  which is generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share is required 
this information is required to be determined as if we had accounted for employee stock 
table of contents options under the fair value method of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to the option plans at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 to stock based employee compensation 
year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net loss attributable to common shares as reported add unearned stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss attributable to common shares deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under a fair value based method for all grants  net of related tax effects net loss attributable to common shares pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common shares as reported basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common shares pro forma the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net loss and net loss per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net loss and net loss per share in the future years  as the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly

table of contents  and liquidity discussion operating activities 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  million and million at december    and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during  million during and million during we used cash to fund operating activities of million during  million during and million during  primarily due to our net loss  adjusted for non cash charges  as operating costs  primarily employee and employee related costs  exceeded the related revenues from the sale of our software products and services 
also contributing to the use of cash in operating activities in  and were net cash outlays totaling million  million and million  respectively  related to our  and strategic restructuring activities 
additionally during  we paid million in interest payments related to the convertible subordinated notes  million in insurance premiums and we used million to make certain software and hardware support and maintenance renewal payments 
a more detailed discussion of our  and operating results can be found in the results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
of the cash held outside of the united states  we may face restrictions on our ability to use that cash for purposes other than the operation of each of our respective foreign subsidiaries that hold the cash 
for example  our ability to use cash held in our german subsidiary for any reason other than the operation of this subsidiary may result in certain tax liabilities and may be subject to local laws that could prevent the transfer of cash from germany to any other foreign or domestic account 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  contracts with vendors  and working capital  as a significant portion or our worldwide operations have a functional currency other than the united states dollar 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations cannot be predicted adequately 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
revenue generated from the sale of our products and services may not increase to a level that exceeds our expenses or could fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in customer demand or acceptance of future products 
although we expect to continue to review our operating expenses  if we are not successful in achieving a cost reduction or generating sufficient revenues  our cash flow from operations will continue to be negatively impacted 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collections efforts by an analysis of the average number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing  amount of our future revenues  payment terms on customer contracts and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
a number of non cash items have been charged to expense and increased our net loss in these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets  amortization of unearned stock based compensation and other stock based compensation charges and provisions for doubtful accounts 
to the extent these non cash items increase or decrease in amount and increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
our operating cash flows will be impacted in the future based on the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we endeavor to pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods may be impacted by the nature of accounts payable arrangements

as of december  and  marketable securities totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
financing activities 
during  financing activities provided million in cash while during and we used cash in financing activities of million and million  respectively  to retire a significant portion of our convertible debt and to payoff capital lease obligations 
the cash outlays were partially offset by proceeds raised in a financing transaction closed in the fourth quarter of with general atlantic partners and certain other investors detailed below  the repayment of notes receivable from officers and shareholders and from the exercise of stock options 
during  we raised million through the issuance of senior secured convertible notes to general atlantic investors and million in proceeds related to our line of credit facility with silicon valley bank

the financing transaction consisted of approximately million in gross cash proceeds and the retirement of million in face value of our convertible subordinated notes in the form of shares of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock  and the issuance to general atlantic partners and its affiliates of warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the cash proceeds to us  net of transaction costs  totaled million 
we receive cash from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds is difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan and general market conditions 

table of contents we have no present understandings  commitments or agreements for any material acquisitions of  or investments in  other complementary businesses  products or technologies 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of  or investments in  other businesses  products and technologies  and may in the future utilize our cash resources or may require additional equity or debt financing to accomplish any acquisitions or investments 
these alternatives could increase liquidity through the infusion of investment capital by third party investors or decrease our liquidity as a result of critical path seeking to fund expansion into these markets 
such expansions might also cause an increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses

table of contents additional factors that may affect future operating results we have a history of losses  expect continuing losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have not achieved profitability in any period and may continue to incur net losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we intend to continue to spend resources on maintaining and strengthening our business  and this may  in the near term  cause our operating expenses to increase and our operating results to decline 
in past quarters  we have spent heavily on technology and infrastructure development 
we may continue to spend substantial financial and other resources to further develop and introduce new messaging and identity management solutions  and to improve our sales and marketing organizations  strategic relationships and operating infrastructure 
we expect that our cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  operations  research and customer support expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses could continue to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percent of revenues 
in addition  in future periods we may incur significant non cash charges related to stock based compensation 
if revenues do not correspondingly increase  our operating results could decline 
if we continue to incur net losses in future periods  we may not be able to retain employees  or fund investments in capital equipment  sales and marketing programs  and research and development to successfully compete against our competitors 
we also may never obtain sufficient revenues to exceed our cost structure and achieve profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future 
this may also  in turn  cause the price of our common stock to demonstrate volatility and or continue to decline 
we may need to raise additional capital and may need to initiate other operational strategies to continue our operations 
in the future  we may be required to raise additional funds  particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations 
such financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
additionally  we face a number of challenges in operating our business  including our ability to overcome viability concerns of our prospective customers given our recent capital needs  the amount of resources necessary to maintain worldwide operations and continued sluggishness in technology spending 
concerns about our long term viability may cause our stock price to fall and impair our ability to raise additional capital and may create a concern among our current and future customers and vendors as to whether we will be able to fulfill our contractual obligations 
as a result  current and future customers may determine not to do business with us  which would cause our revenues to decline 
the conversion of our preferred stock would result in a substantial number of additional shares of common stock outstanding  which could decrease the price of our common stock 
as of march   there were  shares of series d preferred stock outstanding which were convertible  at the option of the holders  into approximately million shares of common stock 
if we obtain shareholder approval  we will also amend the terms of the series d preferred stock  including the conversion ratio  to increase the number of shares of common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the series d preferred stock to approximately million 
in addition  if we obtain shareholder approval  we will be issuing approximately million shares of series e preferred stock which are initially convertible  at the option of the holders  into an equal number of shares of common stock 
in addition  if all the subscription rights being offered in the proposed rights offering are exercised  the shares of series e preferred stock issued in the rights offering will initially convert into up to approximately million shares of common stock 
accordingly  if we obtain shareholder approval and we sell all the shares of preferred stock offered in the proposed rights offering  our preferred stock will initially be convertible into approximately million shares of common stock 
even if we do not obtain shareholder approval  in addition to the approximately million shares of common stock currently issuable upon conversion of the outstanding series d preferred stock  approximately million in principal amount of convertible secured notes plus accrued dividends will be convertible  at the option of each note holder  into approximately million shares of common stock 
increasing the number of 
table of contents additional shares of common stock that may be sold into the market by this amount could substantially decrease the price of our common stock 
as the preferred stock accrues dividends  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion will increase  which may increase the dilution to our holders of common stock and further decrease the price of our common stock 
currently  shares of series d preferred stock accrue dividends at a compounded annual rate of 
if the maximum amount of dividends were to accrue to the series d preferred stock prior to the automatic call for redemption date  a total of approximately million shares of common stock  or an additional million shares  would be issuable upon conversion 
if our shareholders approve the amendment to the terms of the series d preferred stock and we issue approximately million shares of series e preferred stock  all of which will accrue dividends at a rate of per year  and the maximum amount of dividends accrue prior to the automatic call for redemption date  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion will increase by approximately million shares to approximately million shares 
our preferred stock carries a substantial liquidation preference  which could significantly impact the return to common equity holders upon an acquisition 
in the event of liquidation  dissolution  winding up or change of control of critical path  if we issue shares of series e preferred stock  the holders of series e preferred stock would be entitled to receive per share of series e preferred stock plus all accrued dividends on such share before any proceeds from the liquidation  dissolution or winding up is paid with respect to any other series or class of our capital stock 
accordingly  if we obtain stockholder approval for the transactions contemplated by the convertible note purchase and exchange agreement and the january and march private placements  the approximately million shares of series e preferred stock that will be outstanding will initially have an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million 
if all million additional shares of series e preferred stock are purchased pursuant to the proposed rights offering  the initial aggregate liquidation preference of the series e preferred stock will increase to approximately million 
the aggregate amount of the preference will increase as the shares of series e preferred stock accrue dividends based on simple interest at an annual rate of 
after all of the then outstanding shares of series e preferred stock have received payment of their liquidation preference  the holders of series d preferred stock would be entitled to receive  at a minimum  per share of series d preferred stock plus all accrued dividends on such share before any proceeds from the liquidation  dissolution or winding up is paid to holders of our common stock 
as of march   the shares of series d preferred stock have an aggregate initial liquidation preference of approximately million  which  as amended  will increase on a daily basis at an annual rate of 
as amended  the shares of series d preferred stock have a maximum aggregate initial liquidation preference of approximately million 
if we are acquired before the fourth anniversary of the date the shares of series e preferred stock are first issued  the holders of series d preferred stock will be entitled to receive an initial preference payment equal to approximately million  regardless of the amount of dividends accrued at the time of the acquisition 
holders of our common stock will not receive any proceeds from a liquidation  winding up or dissolution  including from a change of control  until after the liquidation preferences of the our series e preferred stock and our series d preferred stock are paid in full 
consequently  the sale of all or substantially all of the shares of critical path may likely result in all or substantially all of the proceeds of such transaction being distributed to the holders of our series e preferred stock and series d preferred stock 
from time to time we engage in discussions with or receive proposals from third parties relating to potential acquisitions or strategic transactions that could constitute a change of control 
while we have not engaged in any transaction of this type in the past  we will in the future continue to evaluate potential business combinations or strategic transactions which  if consummated  may constitute a change of control and trigger the liquidation preferences described above 

table of contents issuance of series e preferred stock and the amendment to the terms of our series d preferred stock will cause us to record charges that increase the net loss attributable to our common shareholders  which may be material to our results of operations for the period in which they are recorded 
based on our current estimates  the application of generally accepted accounting principles to account for the proposed rights offering  the conversion of the notes we privately sold in november  january and march into series e preferred stock  the amendment of the terms of our series d preferred stock and the issuance of series e preferred stock in exchange for some outstanding shares of series d preferred stock will cause us to record charges that increase our net loss attributable to common shares 
because these charges will be based in part on the fair value of our common stock and the series e preferred stock on the date or dates the series e preferred stock is issued  and on the fair value of the series d preferred stock on the date its rights and preferences are modified  we are only able to estimate the amount of the charges that will occur 
assuming that these transactions occurred on november   except for the issuance of the notes which occurred on november   january  and march  and the estimated fair market values of the common stock  the series e preferred stock and the series d preferred stock on such dates  we estimate that one time charges would total approximately million to be recorded in the period that shareholders approve the transactions  and that additional charges totaling million would be recorded over the four year redemption period of the series e preferred stock if all of the shares offered of series e preferred stock are purchased in the proposed rights offering 
a change in the fair value of our common stock  or our series e preferred stock  as of the date or dates we issue the series e preferred stock  or our series d preferred stock  as of the date we amend the terms of the series d preferred stock  would cause these estimates to vary 
our cash resources located in accounts outside of the united states are not readily available for our domestic operations 
we face restrictions on our ability to use cash that we currently hold outside of the united states for purposes other than the operation of each of our respective foreign subsidiaries that hold such cash 
for example  our ability to use cash held in our german subsidiary for any reason other than the operation of this subsidiary may result in certain tax liabilities and are subject to local laws that could prevent the transfer of cash from germany to any other foreign or domestic account 
at december   approximately million was held outside of the united states 
our inability to utilize this cash could slow our ability to grow our business and reach our business objectives 
we may also be forced to incur certain costs  such as tax liabilities  to be able to use this cash for domestic operations  which could cause our expenses to increase and our operating results to decline 
due to our evolving business strategy and the nature of the messaging and directory infrastructure market  our future revenues are unpredictable and our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
we cannot accurately forecast our revenues as a result of our evolving business strategy and the emerging nature of the internet messaging infrastructure market 
forecasting is further complicated by recent strategic and operational restructurings  as well as fluctuations in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues from in to in and in our revenues in some past quarters fell and could continue to fall short of expectations if we experience delays or cancellations of even a small number of orders 
we often offer volume based pricing  which may affect our operating margins 
a number of factors are likely to cause fluctuations in operating results  including  but not limited to the demand for licensed solutions for messaging  and identity management products  the demand for outsourced messaging services generally and the use of messaging and identity management infrastructure products and services in particular  our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain customer satisfaction  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with industry expertise  particularly sales personnel  the ability to upgrade  develop and maintain our systems and infrastructure and to effectively respond to the rapid technology change of the messaging and identity management infrastructure market  
table of contents the budgeting and payment cycles of our customers and potential customers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of business and infrastructure  our ability to quickly handle and alleviate technical difficulties or system outages  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced services by competitors  general economic and market conditions and their affect on our operations and the operations of our customers  and the effect of war  terrorism and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide 
in addition to the factors set forth above  operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the extent to which we incur non cash charges associated with stock based arrangements with employees and non employees 
in particular  during the year ended december  and the three months ended march   we incurred stock based compensation expense of million and  respectively  relating to the grant of options and warrants to employees and non employees in prior years 
as of march   we had recognized all stock based compensation related to these prior grants 
we incurred non cash charges of  during the year ended december   associated with the acceleration of vesting of stock options and the extension of stock option exercise periods in connection with employee terminations 
grants of options and warrants also may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
our revenues and operating results have declined and could continue to decline as a result of the elimination of product or service offerings through termination  sale or other disposition 
future decisions to eliminate  revise or limit any other offerings of a product or service would involve other factors that could cause our revenues to decline and our expenses to increase  including the expenditure of capital  the realization of losses  further reductions in our workforce  facility consolidation or the elimination of revenues along with the associated costs 
as a result of the foregoing  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of operating results are a good indication of future performance 
it is likely that operating results in some quarters will be below market expectations 
in this event  the price of our common stock is likely to prove volatile and or subject to further declines 
if we fail to improve our sales and marketing results  we may be unable to grow our business  which could cause our operating results to decline 
our ability to increase revenues will depend on our ability to continue successfully to recruit  train and retain experienced and effective sales and marketing personnel and for our personnel to achieve results once they are employed with us 
competition for experienced and effective personnel in certain markets is intense and we may not be able to hire and retain personnel with relevant experience 
the complexity and implementation of our messaging and identity management infrastructure products and services require highly trained sales and marketing personnel to educate prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our services 
current and prospective customers  in turn  must be able to educate their end users 
any delays or difficulties encountered in our staffing and training efforts would impair our ability to attract new customers and enhance our relationships with existing customers  and ultimately  grow revenues 
this would also adversely impact the timing and extent of our revenues from quarter to quarter and overall or could jeopardize sales altogether 
because we have experienced turnover in our sales force and have fewer resources than many of our competitors  our sales and marketing organizations may not be able to compete successfully against the sales and marketing organizations of our competitors 
moreover  our competitors frequently have larger and more established sales forces calling upon potential enterprise customers with more frequency 
in addition  certain of our competitors have longer and closer relationships with the senior management of enterprise customers who decide whose technologies and solutions to deploy 
if we do not successfully operate and grow our sales and marketing activities  our revenues and operating results could decline and the price of our common stock could continue to decline 

table of contents we have experienced significant turnover of senior management and our current executive management team has been together for a limited time  which could slow the growth of our business and cause our operating results to decline 
throughout  and the early part of  we announced a series of changes in our management that included the departure of many senior executives  and there have also been many changes in our board of directors 
many of the members of our current board of directors and senior executives joined us in and  and we may continue to make additional changes to our senior management team 
our chief financial officer  james clark  joined us on february  because of these changes  our management team has not worked together as a group for a significant length of time and may not be able to work together effectively to successfully execute on revenue goals  implement our strategies and manage our operations 
if our management team is unable to accomplish our business objectives  our ability to grow our business and successfully meet operational challenges could be severely impaired 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
it is possible that this high turnover at our senior management levels may also continue for a variety of reasons 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key senior executive officers could also affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives which could slow the growth of our business and cause our operating results to decline 
we depend on strategic relationships and the loss of any key strategic relationships could reduce our ability to sell our products and services and our revenues to decline 
we depend on strategic relationships to expand distribution channels and opportunities and to undertake joint product development and marketing efforts 
our ability to increase revenues depends upon aggressively marketing our services through new and existing strategic relationships 
in the third quarter of  we entered into certain partnership agreements in our hosted messaging business with the hewlett packard company for the development and marketing of a complete managed messaging solution 
in coming quarters we will continue to invest heavily in this relationship and make changes in our operations  including completion of the outsourcing of our data operations  to accommodate the integration of this partnership 
to the extent this integration does not proceed as anticipated or the anticipated benefits of this partnership are not borne out  our revenues may not reach the level expected from the amount of capital we have invested in this relationship and our financial results may decline 
in addition  if service levels are not adequate in connection with the outsourcing of our data centers  our customers may terminate agreements and our revenues will decline 
we have also invested heavily and continue to invest in this model of hosted services operations 
to the extent this strategic decision and the business relationships surrounding its execution do not prove profitable and productive  our revenues and financial results could decline 
we also depend on a broad acceptance of our software and outsourced messaging services on the part of potential resellers and partners and our acceptance as a supplier of outsourced messaging solutions 
we also depend on joint marketing and product development through strategic relationships to achieve further market acceptance and brand recognition 
our agreements with strategic partners typically do not restrict them from introducing competing services 
these agreements typically are for terms of one to three years  and automatically renew for additional one year periods unless either party gives prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreement 
in addition  these agreements are terminable by our partners without cause  and some agreements are terminable by us  upon a period of to days notice 
most of our hosted customer agreements also provide for the partial refund of fees paid or other monetary penalties in the event that our services fail to meet defined minimum performance standards 
distribution partners may choose not to renew existing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition to strategic relationships  we also depend on the ability of our customers aggressively to sell and market our services to their end users 
if we lose any strategic relationships  fail to renew these agreements or relationships  fail to fully exploit our relationships  or fail to develop new strategic relationships  we could encounter increased difficulty in selling our products and services 

table of contents a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our revenues and if we lose a major customer or are unable to attract new customers  revenues could decline 
we expect that sales of our products and services to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
for example  for the year ended december   our top customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
similarly  for the year ended december   our top customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues and  for the year ended december   our top customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our current customers  and to attract new customers  in our target markets 
the loss of one or several major customers  whether through termination of agreements  acquisitions or bankruptcy  could significantly reduce our revenues 
our agreements with our customers typically have terms of one to three years often with automatic one year renewals and can be terminated without cause upon certain notice periods that vary among our agreements and range from a period of to days notice 
in addition  a number of our customers  particularly for our hosted services business and in the technology industry  have also suffered from falling revenue 
especially in the telecommunications industry  which represented of the revenues from our top customers for the year ended december  similarly  customers in the telecommunications industry accounted for of revenues from our top customers for the year ended december  and for of revenues from our top customers for the year ended december  the relative financial performance of our customers will continue to impact our sales cycles and our ability to attract new business 
worldwide technology spending has also decreased in recent quarters across all industries 
if our customers terminate their agreements for any reason before the end of the contract term  the loss of the customer could reduce our current and future revenues 
also  if we are unable to enter into agreements with new customers and develop business with our existing customers  our business will not grow and we will not generate additional revenues 
if we are unable to successfully compete in our product market  our ability to retain our customers and attract new customers could decline 
because we have a variety of messaging and directory infrastructure products and services  we encounter different competitors at each level of our products and services 
our primary competitors for service providers seeking insourced or outsourced product based solutions are sun microsystems iplanet  openwave systems  inc  mirapoint  inc  oracle corporation  microsoft corporation and ibm corporation s lotus division 
in the enterprise ebusiness directory category  we compete primarily with iplanet  microsoft corporation and novell corporation  and our competitors in the meta directory market are iplanet  microsoft  novell and siemens corporation 
our competitors for corporate customers seeking outsourced hosted messaging solutions are e mail service providers  such as commtouch  easylink services corporation formerly mail 
com  usa 
net and application service providers who offer hosted communications services and hosted microsoft exchange services 
if we are unable to successfully compete in our product market  our ability to retain our customers and attract new customers could decline 
we believe that some of the competitive factors affecting the market for messaging and identity management infrastructure solutions include breadth of platform features and functionality of our offerings and the sophistication and innovation of competitors  total cost of ownership and operation  scalability  reliability  performance and ease of expansion and upgrade  ease of integration to customers existing systems  and flexibility to enable customers to manage certain aspects of their systems internally and leverage outsourced services in other cases when resources  costs and time to market reasons favor an outsourced offering 

table of contents we believe competition will continue to be fierce and further increase as current competitors aggressively pursue customers  increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do and may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established and better financed companies 
any delay in our development and delivery of new services or enhancement of existing services would allow our competitors additional time to improve their service or product offerings  and provide time for new competitors to develop and market messaging and directory infrastructure products and services and solicit prospective customers within our target markets 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could cause our financial results to decline 
we may not be able to respond to the rapid technological change of the messaging and identity management infrastructure industry 
the messaging and identity management infrastructure industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing services  proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
we must continually develop or introduce and improve the performance  features and reliability of our services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our existing email and messaging services and to develop new services  functionality and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers 
if we do not properly identify the feature preferences of prospective customers  or if we fail to deliver email features that meet the standards of these customers  our ability to market our service successfully and to increase revenues could be impaired 
the development of proprietary technology and necessary service enhancements entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
we may not be able to keep pace with the latest technological developments 
we may also be unable to use new technologies effectively or adapt services to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
our sales cycle is lengthy  and any delays or cancellations in order in a particular quarter could cause our operating results to be below expectations which may cause our stock price to decline 
because we sell complex and sophisticated technology  our sales cycle  in particular with respect to our software solutions  can be long and unpredictable  often taking between four to months 
because of the nature of our product and service offerings it can take many months of customer education and product evaluation before a purchase decision is made 
in addition  many factors can influence the decision to purchase our product and service offerings including budgetary restraints and decreases in capital expenditures  quarterly fluctuations in operating results of customers and potential customers  the emerging and evolving nature of the internet based services and wireless services markets 
furthermore  general global economic conditions  and weakness in global securities markets  continuing recessionary spending levels  and a protracted slowdown in technology spending in particular  have further lengthened and affected our sales cycle 
such factors have led to and could continue to lead to delays and postponements in purchasing decisions and in many cases cancellations of anticipated orders 
any delay or cancellation in sales of our products or services could cause our operating results to be lower than those projected and cause our stock price to decline 
failure to resolve pending securities claims and other material lawsuits may lead to continued costs and expenses and increased doubts from existing and potential customers and investors as to our prospects  which could cause our revenues and our stock price to decline 
we are a defendant in a shareholder lawsuit filed in san diego superior court by shareholders of one of our former customers alleging we participated in fraudulent transactions to inflate artificially revenues of that customer 
we are also a defendant in a number of securities class action lawsuits filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york  alleging that prospectuses under which securities were sold contained false and misleading statements with respect to discounts and commissions received by underwriters 
should these lawsuits linger for a long period of time  whether ultimately resolved in our favor or not  or 
table of contents further lawsuits be filed against us  coverage limits of our insurance or our ability to pay such amounts may not be adequate to cover the fees and expenses and any ultimate resolution associated with such litigation 
likewise  we may not be able to conclude or settle such litigation on terms that coincide with the coverage limits of our insurance or ability to pay upon any final determination 
it is also likely that our insurance may not cover some or all of the claims alleged in the pending lawsuits  which would require us  rather than our insurance carrier  to pay all or some of the expenses and damages  if any  relating to these claims 
the size of these payments  individually or in the aggregate  could seriously impair our cash reserves and financial condition 
the continued defense of these lawsuits also could result in continued diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could cause our financial results to decline 
a failure to resolve definitively current or future material litigation in which we are involved or in which we may become involved in the future  regardless of the merits of the respective cases  could also cast doubt as to our prospects in the eyes of our customers  potential customers and investors  which could cause our revenues and stock price to further decline 
lingering effects of the recent sec investigation could cause further disruption in our operations and lead to a decline in our financial results 
in  the sec investigated us and certain of our former officers and directors related to non specified accounting matters  financial reports  other public disclosures and trading activity in our stock 
in february  the sec concluded the investigation as to us 
we consented  without admitting or denying liability  to a cease and desist order and an administrative order for violation of certain non fraud provisions of the federal securities laws 
in addition  since then the sec and the department of justice charged five of our former employees with various violations of the securities laws 
we believe that the investigation continues with respect to a number of other of our former executives and employees and expect that such investigation may result in further charges against former employees although we do not know the status of such investigation 
despite the conclusion of the investigation of us  lingering concerns about these actions have nevertheless cast doubt on our future in the eyes of customers and investors 
in addition  a number of recent arrests  allegations and investigations in connection with accounting improprieties  insider trading and fraud at other public companies have created investor uncertainty and scrutiny in general as to the stability and veracity of public companies financial statements 
such lingering doubts stemming from our past accounting restatements and such general market uncertainty could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate and or decline further 
our failure to carefully manage expenses and growth could require us to use substantial resources and cause our operating results to decline 
in the past  our management of operational expenses  including the restructurings of our operations  and the growth of our business have placed significant strains on managerial  operational and financial resources and contributed to our history of losses 
in addition  to manage any future growth and profitability  we may need to improve or replace our existing operational  customer service and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any failure to properly manage these systems and procedural transitions could impair our ability to attract and service customers  and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and delays in the execution of our business plan 
if we cannot manage growth and expenses effectively  our business and operating results could decline 
limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may cause us to use our capital resources  which could cause our financial results to decline or slow our growth 
our current director and officer liability insurance  which was put in place in march  and continues through march  may not be adequate for the liabilities and expenses potentially incurred in connection with current and future claims 
to the extent liabilities  expenses or settlements exceed the limitations or are outside of the scope of coverage  our business and financial condition could materially decline 
under california law  in connection with our charter documents and indemnification agreements we entered into with our executive officers and directors  we must indemnify our current and former officers and 
table of contents directors to the fullest extent permitted by law 
the indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with the investigation  defense  settlement or appeal of legal proceedings 
we have made payments and may continue to make payments in connection with the indemnification of officers and directors in connection with lawsuits and possibly pending investigations 
see lingering effects of the recent sec investigations could cause further disruption in our operations and lead to a decline in our financial results on page however  it is unlikely that our director and officer liability insurance will be available to cover such payments 
we may experience difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel  which may negatively affect our ability to develop new services or retain and attract customers 
the loss of the services of key personnel may create a negative perception of our business and adversely affect our ability to achieve our business goals 
our success also depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled sales and marketing  operational  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for these people is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit  train or retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to do so  we may be unable to develop new services or continue to provide a high level of customer service  which could result in the loss of customers and revenues 
in addition  volatility and declines in our stock price may also affect our ability to retain key personnel  all of whom have been granted stock based incentive compensation 
in recent quarters we have also initiated reductions in our work force and job eliminations to balance the size of our employee base with anticipated revenue levels 
reductions in our workforce could make it difficult to motivate and retain remaining employees or attract needed new employees  and provide distractions affecting our ability to deliver products and solutions in a timely fashion and provide a high level of customer service and support 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
the loss of the services of one or more of our current key personnel could make it difficult to successfully implement our business objectives 
if we are not successful in implementing strategic plans for our operations  our expenses may not be offset by our corresponding sales and our financial results could significantly decline 
in  we incurred a number of restructuring charges related to the right sizing of our business given market conditions and the current operating environment 
these efforts included additional facilities and equipment lease terminations  continuing expense management and headcount reductions 
in  we continued to restructure our operations including consolidating some office locations and reducing our global workforce by approximately positions  or approximately of the workforce 
we expect to continue to make determinations about the strategic future of our business and operations  and our ability to execute on such plans effectively and to make such determinations prudently could affect our future operations 
a failure to execute successfully on such plans and to plan appropriately could cause or expenses to continue to outpace our revenues and our financial condition could significantly decline 
we may experience a decrease in market demand due to the slowed economy in the united states  which has been further stymied by the concerns of terrorism  war and social and political instability 
economic growth has slowed significantly 
in addition  the terrorist attacks in the united states and turmoil and war in the middle east have increased the uncertainty in the united states economy and may further add to the decline in the united states business environment 
the war on terrorism  along with the effects of terrorist attacks and other similar events  and the war in iraq  could contribute further to the slowdown of the already slumping market demand for goods and services  including digital communications software and services 
if the economy continues to decline as a result of the recent economic  political and social turmoil  or if there are further terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere  or as a result of war in the middle east and elsewhere  we may experience decreases in the demand for our products and services  which may cause our operating results to decline 

table of contents we may face continued technical  operational and strategic challenges preventing us from successfully integrating or divesting acquired businesses 
acquisitions involve risks related to the integration and management of acquired technology  operations and personnel 
in addition  in connection with our strategic restructuring  we elected to divest or discontinue many of the acquired businesses 
both the integration and divestiture of acquired businesses have been and will continue to be complex  time consuming and expensive processes  which may disrupt and distract our management 
with respect to integration  we must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices to be successful 
with respect to the divestitures  the timing and transition of those businesses and their customers to other entities has required and will continue to require resources from our legal  finance and corporate development teams as well as expenses associated with the conclusion of those transactions  winding up of entities and businesses 
in addition to the added costs of the divestitures  we may not ultimately achieve anticipated benefits and or cost reductions from such divestitures 
in the past  due to the significant underperformance of some of our acquisitions relative to expectation  we eliminated certain acquired product or service offerings through termination  sale or other disposition 
such decisions to eliminate or limit our offering of an acquired product or service involved and could continue to include the expenditure of capital  the realization of losses  further reduction in workforce  facility consolidation and the elimination of revenues along with the associated costs  any of which could cause our operating results to decline 
we currently license many third party technologies and may need to license further technologies which could delay and increase the cost of product and service developments 
we intend to continue to license certain technologies from third parties and incorporate them into our products and services  including web server technology  virus and anti spam solutions  storage and encryption technology and billing and customer tracking solutions 
the market is evolving and we may need to license additional technologies to remain competitive 
we may not be able to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
to the extent we cannot license needed technologies or solutions  we may have to devote our resources to the development of such technologies  which could delay and increase the cost of product and service developments 
in addition  we may fail to integrate successfully any licensed or hosted technology into our services 
these third party in licenses may expose us to increased risks  including risks related to the integration of new technology  potential patent and copyright infringement issues  the diversion of resources from the development of proprietary technology  and an inability to generate revenues from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
in addition  an inability to obtain needed licenses could delay product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
any delays in services or integration problems could hinder our ability to retain and attract customers and cause our business and operating results to suffer 
changes in the regulatory environment for the operation of our business or those of our customers could pose risks 
few laws currently apply directly to activity on the internet and the messaging business  however  new laws are proposed and other laws made applicable to internet communications every year 
in particular  the operations of our business faces risks associated with privacy  confidentiality of user data and communications  consumer protection  taxation  content  copyright  trade secrets  trademarks  antitrust  defamation and other legal issues 
in particular  legal concerns with respect to communication of confidential data have affected our financial services and health care customers due to newly enacted federal legislation 
the growth of the industry and the proliferation of internet based messaging devices and services may prompt further legislative attention to our industry and thus invite more regulatory control of our business 
the imposition of more stringent protections or new regulations and application of laws to our business could burden our company and those with which we do business 
any decreased generalized demand for our services or the loss of  or 
table of contents decrease  in business by a key partner due to regulation or the expense of compliance with any regulation  could either increase the costs associated with our business or affect revenue  either of which could cause our financial condition or operating results to decline 
certain of our service offerings include operations subject to the digital millennium copyright act of and the european union s recent privacy directives 
our efforts to remain in compliance with dmca and the eu privacy directives may not be sufficient 
new legislation and case law may also affect our products and services and the manner in which we offer them  which could cause our revenues to decline 
in addition  the applicability of laws and regulations directly applicable to the businesses of our customers  particularly customers in the fields of banking and health care  will continue to affect us 
the security of information about our customers end users continues to be an area where a variety of laws and regulations with respect to privacy and confidentiality are enacted 
as our customers implement the protections and prohibitions with respect to the transmission of end user data  our customers will look to us to assist them in remaining in compliance with this evolving area of regulation 
in particular the gramm leach bliley act contains restrictions with respect to the use and protection of banking records for end users whose information may pass through our system and the health insurance portability and accountability act contains provisions that require our customers to ensure the confidentiality of their customers health care information 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act of and new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
in addition to final rules and rule proposals already made by the securities and exchange commission  the nasdaq stock market has adopted revisions to its requirements for listed companies 
we are currently reviewing all of our accounting policies and practices  legal disclosure and corporate governance policies under the new legislation  including those related to our relationships with our independent auditors  enhanced financial disclosures  internal controls  board and board committee practices  corporate responsibility and loan practices  and intend fully to comply with such laws 
we expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our various committees of the board including  in particular  the audit committee 
given the significant turnover of the members of our board of directors and the fact that some members would not qualify as independent under the new sec rules and the listing standards adopted by the nasdaq stock market to which we are subject  it may be difficult for us to maintain sufficient independent directors to comply with these new rules and regulations 
for instance  we currently do not have a sufficient number of independent directors to constitute a majority of the board or to serve on the audit committee of the board under listing standards that will apply later this year 
if we fail to comply  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
please see the discussion below titled we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq national market  and if we fail to do so  the price and liquidity of our common stock may decline 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq national market  and if we fail to do so  the price and liquidity of our common stock may decline 
the nasdaq stock market has quantitative maintenance criteria for the continued listing of common stock on the nasdaq national market 
the current requirements affecting us include i having total assets of at least million  ii having total revenue of million  and iii maintaining a minimum closing bid price per share of 
on december   the nasdaq stock market inc issued us a letter that we were not in compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement and  therefore  faced delisting proceedings 
since that time  we have worked with the nasdaq stock market in an effort to maintain our listing 
on july   the nasdaq stock market notified us that we had regained compliance with the requirements for continued listing 
nevertheless  we may not be able to comply with the quantitative or quantitative maintenance criteria or any of the nasdaq national market s listing requirements or other rules  or other markets listing requirements to the extent our stock is listed elsewhere  in the future 
for instance  if we were to issue a large number of shares of common stock  the price per share of the common stock could fall 
if we fail to maintain continued listing on the nasdaq national market and must move to a market with 
table of contents less liquidity  our stock price would likely further decline 
if we are delisted  it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of  and the liquidity of the trading market for  our common stock 
we may have liability for internet content and we may not have adequate liability insurance 
as a provider of messaging and directory services  we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted via our services 
we do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by our users  and we could be exposed to liability with respect to this content 
furthermore  some foreign governments  such as germany  have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the united states 
in some instances  we may be subject to criminal liability in connection with internet content transmission 
our current insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
there is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims  if successfully asserted against us  could exceed the total of our coverage limits 
there also is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims asserted against us may not qualify for coverage under our insurance policies as a result of coverage exclusions that are contained within these policies 
should either of these risks occur  capital contributed by our shareholders might need to be used to settle claims 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could result in substantial out of pocket costs to us  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
unknown software defects could disrupt our services and harm our business and reputation 
our software products are inherently complex 
additionally  our product and service offerings depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects or errors in translation  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released or localized for international markets 
we may not discover software defects in our products or that affect new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
despite testing  it is possible that defects may occur in the software 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage our reputation or increase service costs  cause us to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert development resources 
unplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints could reduce our ability to provide messaging services and could harm our business reputation 
our customers have  in the past  experienced some interruptions in our hosted messaging service 
we believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time 
these interruptions may be due to hardware failures  unsolicited bulk e mail  or spam  attacks and operating system failures or other causes beyond our control 
our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers will suffer and our revenues will decline if we experience frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of systems or networks or reduce our ability to provide email services 
we expect to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to unanticipated sharply increased traffic  which may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  impaired quality and degradation in levels of customer service 
if this were to continue to happen  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers could suffer dramatically and our revenues would decline 
we have entered into hosted messaging agreements with some customers that require minimum performance standards  including standards regarding the availability and response time of messaging services 
if we fail to meet these standards  our customers could terminate their relationships with us and we could be subject to contractual monetary penalties 
if our system security is breached  our reputation could suffer and our revenues could decline 
a fundamental requirement for online communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers 
if these attempts are successful  customers confidential information  including customers profiles  passwords  
table of contents financial account information  credit card numbers or other personal information could be breached 
we may be liable to our customers for any breach in security and a breach could harm our reputation 
we rely on encryption technology licensed from third parties 
our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to license encryption technology and additional technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
failure to prevent security breaches may make it difficult to retain and attract customers and cause us to spend additional resources that could cause our operating results to decline 
we rely on trademark  copyright  trade secret laws  contractual restrictions and patents to protect our proprietary rights  and if these rights are not sufficiently protected  our ability to compete and generate revenue could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  and patents to establish and protect our proprietary rights  which we view as critical to our success 
our ability to compete and grow our business could suffer if these rights are not adequately protected 
despite the precautionary measures we take  unauthorized third parties may infringe or copy portions of our services or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  which could harm our competitive position and market share 
in addition  we have several patents pending in the united states and may seek additional patents in the future 
however  the status of united states patent protection in the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the us patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
we do not know if our patent applications or any of our future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents we have received or will receive will be challenged or invalidated 
our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because laws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use  and end user license provisions in our contracts that protect us against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program may be unenforceable 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop similar technology 
additionally  we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents that may relate to our products 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our software products 
our reserves may be insufficient to cover receivables we are unable to collect 
we assume a certain level of credit risk with our customers in order to do business 
conditions affecting any of our customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner  or at all  for products or services we have already provided them 
for example  if economic conditions decline or if new or unanticipated government regulations are enacted which affect our customers  they may experience financial difficulties and be unable to pay their bills 
in the past  we have experienced significant collection delays from certain customers  and we cannot predict whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays in the future 
in particular  some of our customers are suffering from the general weakness in the economy and among technology companies in particular 
any reserves that we may establish to cover losses due to delays in their inability to pay may not be sufficient to cover our losses 
if losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than our reserves  our capital resources may not be sufficient to meet our operating needs and our business could suffer 

table of contents if we do not successfully address the risks inherent in the conduct of our international operations  our revenues and financial results could decline 
we derived of our revenues from international sales in and of our revenues from international sales in we intend to continue to operate in international markets and to spend significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
in particular  in we purchased the remaining interests of our joint venture partners for our operations in japan 
we hope to expend revenues and plan to increase resources to grow our operations in the asian market 
if revenues from international operations do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations  our business and our ability to increase revenue and improve our operating results could suffer 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete or operate effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and imposition of currency exchange controls  differing technology standards and language and translation issues  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changes in regulatory requirements  including us export restrictions on encryption technologies  political and economic instability  potential adverse tax consequences  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
any of these factors could harm our international operations and  consequently  our business and consolidated operating results 
specifically  failure to successfully manage international growth could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenues in key international markets 
the issuance of our series e preferred stock to the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors upon conversion of their convertible notes and the amendment of the terms of the series d preferred stock will result in significant equity ownership by the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors  which may limit the ability of our other shareholders to influence significant corporate decisions either of which could delay or prevent a change of control or depress our stock price 
if we obtain shareholder approval and convert the notes held by the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors into series e preferred stock and amend the terms of our series d preferred stock  the general atlantic investors will beneficially own approximately of our outstanding securities which represents of the voting power and the cheung kong investors will beneficially own approximately of our outstanding securities which represents of the voting power 
in addition  the general atlantic investors have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase of the shares of series e preferred stock not subscribed for by the holders of our common stock and the cheung kong investors have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase of the shares of series e preferred stock not subscribed for by the holders of our common stock 
further  the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors have the right to purchase shares of series e preferred stock  if any  not purchased by the other 
accordingly  the percentage ownership of the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors may increase as a result of the proposed rights offering 
in addition  the holders of our series d preferred stock  which is controlled by the general atlantic investors  are entitled to elect one director and  upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the convertible note purchase and exchange agreement  the cheung kong investors will have the right to elect one director 
as a result  the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors  although not affiliated  will have the ability  acting together  to control the outcome of shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of a majority of our directors  approval of merger transactions involving us and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combination transactions  charter and 
table of contents bylaw amendments and other significant corporate actions  which could delay or prevent a change in control or depress our stock price 
the issuance of our series e preferred stock to the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors upon conversion of their convertible notes and the amendment of the terms of the series d preferred stock will result in significant equity ownership by the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors  which may result in potential conflicts of interests  which could adversely affect the holders of our common stock  delay a change in control and depress our stock price 
the significant equity ownership by each of the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors could create conflicts of interest between these majority shareholders and our other shareholders and between the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors 
for example  the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors can approve a change in control transaction in order to receive payment of their liquidation preference even if our other shareholders oppose the transaction  which could depress the price of our common stock 
alternatively  the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors may prevent or delay a corporate transaction that is favored by our other shareholders 
in addition  it is also possible that the risk that the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors may disagree on approving a significant corporate transaction  for example a change in control transaction  which could depress our stock price  limit the number of potential investors willing to pursue such a transaction with us or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for future shares of our common stock 
the conversion price for our senior secured convertible notes and the subscription price determined for our proposed rights offering is not necessarily an indication of our value 
the conversion price for our senior secured convertible notes and the subscription price per share of the series e preferred stock in the rights offering was the price proposed by the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors in connection with our negotiation of the convertible note purchase and exchange agreement and was approved by the independent members of our board of directors which excluded william e 
mcglashan  jr  our chief executive officer and a related party of one of our holders of series d preferred stock  and raul j 
fernandez and william e 
ford  each of whom is affiliated with general atlantic based on the recommendation of the strategic alternatives committee of the board of directors 
the conversion price for our senior secured convertible notes and the subscription price do not necessarily bear any relationship to the book value of our assets  past operations  cash flows  losses  financial condition or any other established criteria for value 
the use of our net operating losses could be limited if we undergo an ownership change upon exercise of the subscription rights 
if the exercise of the subscription rights in the proposed rights offering causes us to undergo an ownership change for federal income tax purposes ie  an increase by more than of the amount of stock held by one or more of our shareholders during the past years  our use of our pre change net operating losses will generally be limited annually to the product of the long term tax exempt rate currently and the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change 
this could increase our federal income tax liability if we generate taxable income in the future 
our stock price has demonstrated volatility and overall declines during recent quarters and continued volatility in the stock market may cause further fluctuations and or decline in our stock price 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to experience volatility  wide fluctuations and declines 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  the closing sale prices of our common stock on the nasdaq national market ranged from on december  to on october  and november  our stock price may further decline or fluctuate in response to any number of factors and events  such as announcements related to technological innovations  intense regulatory scrutiny and new corporate and securities and other legislation  strategic and sales relationships  new product and service offerings by us or our competitors  litigation outcomes  changes in senior management  changes in 
table of contents financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets and the market for our stock  media interest in accounting scandals and corporate governance questions  overall market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  particularly with respect to technology stocks  has experienced extreme volatility and a significant cumulative decline in recent quarters 
this volatility and decline has affected many companies  including our company  irrespective of the specific operating performance of such companies 
these broad market influences and fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  and our ability to remain listed on the nasdaq national market  regardless of our operating performance or other factors 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior shareholder approval  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of our common stock  prohibit shareholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at a meeting 
in march  we adopted a shareholder rights plan or poison pill 
this plan could cause the acquisition of our company by a party not approved by our board of directors to be prohibitively expensive 
in addition  the general atlantic investors and the cheung kong investors own a sufficient amount of our securities to be able to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  which could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an acquisition proposal
