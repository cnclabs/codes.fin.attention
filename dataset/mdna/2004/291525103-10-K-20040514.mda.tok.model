item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation ecc and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company and to emmis operating company and its subsidiaries collectively eoc 
eoc became a wholly owned subsidiary of ecc in connection with the company s reorganization see note c 
to our consolidated financial statements on june  unless otherwise noted  all disclosures contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in the form k apply to emmis and eoc 
we own and operate radio  television and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
broadcast entities ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron radio market reports for radio stations and by ac nielsen company for television stations 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research and advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
our television division s revenues typically fluctuate from year to year due to political spending  which is the highest in our odd numbered fiscal years 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for each of the past three years 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national political publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to 
table of contents costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions  and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities and office salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under sfas no 
require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macro economic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under sfas no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  or to the extent that market values decrease 
allocations for purchased assets we typically engage an independent appraisal firm to value assets acquired in a material acquisition 
we use the appraisal report to allocate the purchase price of the acquisition 
to the extent that purchased assets are not allocated appropriately  depreciation and amortization expense could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  and changes in our customer payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances might be required 
acquisitions  dispositions and investments during the three year period ended february   we acquired three domestic radio stations  one television station  nine international radio stations  and a controlling interest in six domestic radio stations for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
we also disposed of two domestic radio stations for an aggregate cash sales price of million and we have agreed to sell our interest in two international radio stations for million 
a recap of the transactions completed during the three years ended february  is summarized hereafter 
these transactions impact the comparability of operating results year over year 
on december   emmis agreed to sell its controlling interest in votionis  sa votionis  which owns and operates two radio stations in buenos aires  argentina  to its minority partners for million in cash 
the sale is subject to argentine regulatory approvals and is expected to close during our quarter ended may  emmis acquired its interest in votionis in november in october  we exercised our right to purchase the equity interests of our minority partners 
during negotiations with our minority partners  we instead elected to sell our controlling interest 
in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million in fiscal the argentine peso substantially devalued relative to the us dollar early in the loss is primarily attributable to the devaluation of the peso 
votionis has historically been included in the radio reporting segment 
on december   the flemish government awarded licenses to operate nine fm radio stations in the flanders region of belgium to several not for profit entities that have granted emmis the exclusive right to provide the programming and sell the advertising on the stations 
five of these licenses are for the stations that emmis began programming in august and the remaining four related to new stations that emmis began operating in february the licenses are for an initial term of nine years and do not require the payment of any license fees to the flemish government 

table of contents on july   emmis effectively acquired a controlling interest of in a partnership that owns six radio stations in the austin  texas metropolitan area for a cash purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs of million 
these six stations are klbj am  klbj fm  kdht fm  formerly kxmg fm  krox fm  kgsr fm and keyi fm 
this acquisition allowed emmis to diversify its radio portfolio and participate in another large  high growth radio market 
the acquisition was financed through borrowings under the credit facility and was accounted for as a purchase 
the company recorded million of goodwill  all of which is deductible for income tax purposes 
in addition  emmis has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase its partner s entire interest in the partnership after december based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 
effective march   emmis completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of television station wbpg tv in mobile  al pensacola  fl from pegasus communications corporation for approximately million  including transaction costs of million 
we financed the acquisition through borrowings under the credit facility and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
this acquisition will allow us to achieve duopoly efficiencies in the market  such as lower programming acquisition costs and consolidation of general and administrative functions  since we already own a television station in the market  wala 
effective may  emmis completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of kalc fm in denver  colorado to entercom communications corporation for million 
emmis had purchased kalc fm on january   from salem communications corporation for million in cash plus a commitment fee of million and transaction related costs of million 
on february   emmis entered into a definitive agreement to sell kalc fm to entercom and entercom began operating kalc fm under a time brokerage agreement on march  proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
since the agreed upon sales price for this station was less than its carrying amount as of february   we recognized an impairment loss of million in fiscal additionally  in fiscal we recorded an incremental million loss in connection with the sale 
both of these losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
effective may  emmis completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of kxpk fm in denver  colorado to entravision communications corporation for million 
emmis had purchased kxpk fm on august   from amfm  inc for an allocated purchase price of million in cash plus liabilities recorded of million and transaction related costs of million

the company financed the acquisition through a million advance payment borrowed under the credit facility in june and the remainder with borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from ecc s march senior discount notes offering 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
emmis began programming and selling advertising on the radio stations on august  under a time brokerage agreement 
the total purchase price was allocated to property and equipment and broadcast licenses based on an independent appraisal 
broadcast licenses are included in intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and  effective march   are no longer amortized in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with sfas no

for additional pro forma results  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
consistent with management s review of the company  the pro forma results above include the impact of all announced or consummated acquisitions and dispositions  irrespective of materiality 
these pro forma results include the impact of the sale of our two radio stations in denver and our television production company and thus differ from the pro forma financial results reflected in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with gaap 
net revenues discussion radio net revenues increased principally as a result of our acquisition of six radio stations in austin in july on a pro forma basis assuming the austin radio stations had been purchased on march  and the denver radio stations had been sold on march   radio net revenues for the year ended february  would have increased million  or 
we monitor the 
table of contents performance of our stations against the aggregate performance of the markets in which we operate 
on a pro forma basis  for the year ended february  net revenues of our domestic radio stations were up  whereas net revenues in the domestic radio markets in which we operate were up only  based on reports for the periods prepared by miller  kaplan  arase co  llp 
we believe we were able to outperform the markets in which we operate due to our commitment to training and developing local sales forces  as well as higher ratings  resulting  in part  from increased promotional spending in prior quarters 
the higher ratings allowed us to charge higher rates for the advertisements we sold in the current period versus the same period in the prior year 
our advertising inventory sellout decreased slightly year over year 
the increase in television net revenues for the year ended february  is due to strong growth in local advertising revenues offset by a substantial reduction in net political revenues as there were fewer political election campaigns in our fiscal net political advertising revenues for the year ended february  were approximately million 
net political advertising revenues for the year ended february  were approximately million 
despite this decrease in net political revenues  ratings improvements and our commitment to training and developing local sales forces have enabled us to increase our share of local advertising revenues 
although publishing revenues increased for the year ended february  as compared to the same period in the prior year  the national advertising environment continues to be challenging for our publishing division 
however  our magazines have been able to overcome shortfalls in national advertising revenues by producing more custom publications and by increasing special advertiser sections in our magazines 
on a consolidated basis  net revenues for the year ended february  increased due to the effect of the items described above 
on a pro forma basis  net revenues for the year ended february  increased million  or due to the effect of the items described above

station operating expenses  excluding noncash compensation discussion radio station operating expenses  excluding noncash compensation increased as a result of our acquisition of six radio stations in austin in july the increase also relates to higher sales related costs  higher insurance and health related costs  higher programming costs and the reduction of million in noncash compensation expense as more bonuses were paid in cash as opposed to 
table of contents stock in fiscal  which had the impact of increasing cash expenses by an equal amount 
on a pro forma basis assuming the austin radio stations had been purchased on march  and the denver radio stations had been sold on march   radio station operating expenses  excluding noncash compensation  for the year ended february  would have increased million  or 
our acquisition of wbpg tv in march contributed to the increase in television station operating expenses  excluding noncash compensation 
on a pro forma basis assuming the purchase of wbpg tv and sale of mira mobile television had occurred on march   television station operating expenses  excluding noncash compensation  for the year ended february  would have increased million  or 
higher programming costs and higher insurance and health related costs were generally offset by lower sales related costs 
as previously discussed  our publishing division has replaced lost national advertising revenues with revenues from custom publications and special advertiser sections  which are more expensive to produce due principally to higher editorial and production costs 
our publishing division also experienced higher insurance and health related costs 
on a consolidated basis  station operating expenses  excluding noncash compensation  for the year ended february  increased due to the effect of the items described above 
on a pro forma basis  station operating expenses  excluding noncash compensation  for the year ended february  increased million  or due to the effect of the items described above 
noncash compensation expenses for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands noncash compensation expense radio television publishing corporate total noncash compensation expense noncash compensation includes compensation expense associated with restricted common stock issued under employment agreements  common stock issued to employees in lieu of cash bonuses  company matches in our k plans  and common stock issued to employees in exchange for cash compensation pursuant to our stock compensation program 
our stock compensation program resulted in noncash compensation expense of approximately million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
effective march   emmis elected to double its k match to per employee  with one half of the contribution made in emmis stock 
the increased k match was made instead of making a contribution to the company s profit sharing plan 
this resulted in approximately million of additional noncash compensation expense for the year ended february   over the same period in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by the payment of more bonuses in cash as opposed to stock in fiscal as compared to fiscal effective january   we curtailed our stock compensation program by eliminating mandatory participation for employees making less than  per year 
for calendar  this change will result in an estimated million decrease in the company s non cash compensation expense and a corresponding increase in the company s cash operating expense 
in all other respects  the stock compensation program remains comparable to the stock compensation programs in effect for each of the last two calendar years 
no formal decisions have been made regarding its status beyond december 
table of contents corporate expenses  excluding noncash compensation for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands corporate expenses  excluding noncash compensation corporate expenses  excluding noncash compensation increased due to higher insurance and health care costs  professional fees associated with our television digital spectrum initiative  funding for training and diversity initiatives  and higher corporate governance costs 
depreciation and amortization for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands depreciation and amortization radio television publishing corporate total depreciation and amortization substantially all of the increase in radio depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to our austin radio acquisition  which closed on july  television depreciation and amortization expense increased due to additional depreciation of digital equipment upgrades 
publishing depreciation and amortization expense decreased due to certain definite lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased due to higher depreciation expense related to computer equipment and software purchases over the past twelve months 
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the effect of the items described above 
operating income for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands operating income radio television publishing corporate total operating income radio operating income increased due to our austin radio acquisition  partially offset by higher station operating expenses at our existing stations and depreciation and amortization expense  as discussed above 
also noncash compensation in our radio segment decreased by approximately million in fiscal as we paid more bonuses in cash as opposed to stock 
as discussed above  the 
table of contents net revenue growth of our stations exceeded the revenue growth in the markets in which we operate 
we expect our stations to continue to outperform the markets in which we operate as we seek to monetize sustained audience ratings momentum 
television operating income in fiscal includes a million impairment charge relating to the company s annual sfas no 
review 
the remaining decrease is attributable to higher noncash compensation expense  higher depreciation and amortization expense  and the reduction in political net revenues  as discussed above 
we expect our television division to increase operating income in fiscal as our stations will benefit from political advertising spending and revenues from the olympics 
publishing operating income increased due to higher net revenues and lower depreciation and amortization  partially offset by higher station operating expenses  as discussed above 
our publishing division has experienced slow  steady growth  which we expect to continue 
our magazines are generally mature properties with limited direct competition 
corporate operating income declined due to higher corporate expenses  noncash compensation expense  and depreciation and amortization  as discussed above 
we expect corporate expenses to increase in fiscal by approximately  the majority of which results from professional fees incurred in developing a business plan for our television digital spectrum initiative as well as higher governance costs attributable to sarbanes oxley compliance and higher insurance costs 
on a consolidated basis  total operating income decreased due to the changes in radio  television and publishing operating income and higher corporate expenses  as discussed above 
interest expense for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands interest expense emmis eoc with respect to emmis  interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rates we pay on amounts outstanding under our credit facility  which is variable rate debt  repayments of amounts outstanding under our credit facility and redemption of amounts outstanding under our senior discount notes 
the decreased interest rates reflect both a decrease in the base interest rate for our credit facility due to a lower overall interest rate environment  and a decrease in the margin applied to the base rate resulting from the june credit facility amendment 
a portion of the decrease in interest expense is attributable to the expiration of interest rate swap agreements originally entered into in fiscal these swaps  which began expiring in february  had an original aggregate notional amount of million and fixed libor at a weighted average 
as of february   we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding and libor was at approximately 
in the quarter ended may   we repaid amounts outstanding under our credit facility with the proceeds of our denver radio asset sales in may and a portion of the proceeds from our equity offering in april  with the remaining portion being used to redeem amounts outstanding under our senior discount notes in the quarter ended august  we reduced our total debt outstanding by million during the year ended february  with respect to eoc  interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rates we pay on amounts outstanding under our credit facility  and repayments of amounts outstanding under our credit facility as discussed for emmis above 
the difference between interest expense for emmis and eoc is due to interest expense associated with the senior discount notes  for which ecc is the obligor  and thus it is excluded from the results of operations of eoc 
subsequent to the balance sheet date  we refinanced our credit facility and senior subordinated notes and retired substantially all of our senior discount notes 
these debt refinancings will result in significantly lower interest expense in fiscal see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion

tv program rights payable represents payments to be made to various program syndicators and distributors in accordance with current contracts for the rights to broadcast programs 
future tv program rights payable represents commitments for program rights not available for broadcast as of february  
table of contents we expect to fund these payments primarily with cash flows from operations  but we may also issue additional debt or equity or sell assets 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and cash available through revolving loan borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary uses of capital have been historically  and are expected to continue to be  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and funding acquisitions and  in the case of ecc  preferred stock dividend requirements 
since we manage cash on a consolidated basis  any cash needs of a particular segment or operating entity are met by intercompany transactions 
see investing activities below for discussion of specific segment needs 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital for emmis and eoc of million and million  respectively 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital for emmis and eoc of million and million  respectively 
the increase in net working capital primarily relates to the reclassification of the assets of our interest in two radio stations in argentina to current as the sale is expected to be completed within ninety days of the balance sheet date 
operating activities with respect to emmis  net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended february  compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
with respect to eoc  net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended february  compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended february  as compared to the same period in the prior year is due to our increase in net revenues less station operating expenses and corporate expenses 
cash flows provided by operating activities are historically the highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as a significant portion of our accounts receivable collections is derived from revenues recognized in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are our highest revenue quarters 
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended february  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in the same period of the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to our purchase of radio stations in the year ended february  as opposed to our sale of radio stations in the year ended february  investing activities include capital expenditures and business acquisitions and dispositions 
as discussed in results of operations above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  on july   emmis effectively acquired a controlling interest of in a partnership that owns six radio stations in the austin  texas metropolitan area for a cash purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs of million  all of which was funded with borrowings under the credit facility 
emmis sold radio stations kalc fm and kxpk fm in denver  colorado for million in cash in the quarter ended may  the net cash proceeds of million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
in the years ended february   and  we had capital expenditures of million  million  and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  tower upgrades and costs associated with our conversion to digital television 
we anticipate that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business  including approximately million in fiscal for the conversion to digital television 
although all but one of our stations as of april were broadcasting a digital signal  we will incur approximately million of additional costs  after fiscal  to upgrade the digital signals of three of our local stations and six of our satellite stations and to accommodate the channel changes required as analog licenses are retracted 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 

table of contents financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities for emmis and eoc were million and million  respectively  for the year ended february  cash flows used in financing activities for emmis and eoc were million and million  respectively  for the same period of the prior year 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in april  ecc completed the sale of million shares of its class a common stock at per share resulting in total proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of million were contributed to eoc and of the net proceeds were used in april to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the remainder was invested  and in july distributed to ecc to redeem approximately of ecc s million  face value  senior discount notes see discussion below 
as indicated in investing activities above  we paid million on july  for a controlling interest in six radio stations in austin  texas 
these funds were borrowed under our senior credit facility 
also  net proceeds of million from the sale of two radio stations in denver were also used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility during the year ended february  on march   ecc received million of proceeds from the issuance of million face value  senior discount notes due the net proceeds of million  less million held in escrow at ecc  were distributed to eoc and used to fund the acquisition of the phoenix radio stations 
in june  upon completion of the company s reorganization to form eoc and make ecc a holding company  the proceeds held in escrow were released and used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
as of february   eoc had  million of corporate indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility million and senior subordinated notes million  and other indebtedness million 
as of february   total indebtedness outstanding for emmis included all of eoc s indebtedness as well as million of ecc s senior discount notes 
ecc also had million of our convertible preferred stock outstanding 
all outstanding amounts under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to libor or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
as of february   our weighted average borrowing rate under our credit facility was approximately and our overall weighted average borrowing rate  after taking into account amounts outstanding under our senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes  was approximately 
the overall weighted average borrowing rate for eoc  which would exclude the senior discount notes  was approximately the debt service requirements of eoc over the next twelve month period net of interest under our credit facility are expected to be million  after giving effect to the refinancing of the credit facility and senior subordinated notes in may see below 
this amount is comprised of million for interest under our new senior subordinated notes and million for repayment of term notes under our new credit facility 
although interest will be paid under the credit facility at least every three months  the amount of interest is not presently determinable given that the credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
ecc has no additional debt service requirements in the next twelve month period since interest on its senior discount notes accretes into the principal balance of the notes until march however  ecc has preferred stock dividend requirements of million for the next twelve month period 
the terms of ecc s preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share on each january  april  july and october while emmis had sufficient liquidity to declare and pay the dividends as they become due  it was not permitted to do so for the april  payment because emmis leverage ratio under the senior discount notes indenture exceeded and its leverage ratio under the senior subordinated notes indenture exceeded ecc s board of directors set a record date for the april  payment  but did not declare the dividend 
instead  a wholly owned  unrestricted subsidiary of eoc made a payment of 
per share to each preferred shareholder of record 
this subsidiary was permitted under the senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes indentures to make the payment to the preferred shareholders 
currently  emmis meets its leverage ratio requirements under both the senior discount notes indenture and the senior subordinated notes indenture 
on july   ecc s board of directors declared the april  dividend  as well as dividends payable october  and january   and deemed the obligation to pay each dividend to have been discharged by the subsidiary s prior payment 
at april   we had million available under our credit facility  net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio and television stations  as well as publishing properties 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
in addition  emmis has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase our minority partner s entire interest in six radio stations in austin  texas after a period of approximately five years based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 

table of contents on may   we refinanced substantially all of our long term debt 
eoc received million in proceeds from the issuance of its senior subordinated notes due in the principal amount of million  net of the initial purchasers discount of million  and eoc borrowed million under a new billion senior credit facility 
the gross proceeds from these transactions and million of cash on hand were used to i repay the remaining principal indebtedness under eoc s former credit facility of approximately million  ii repurchase million aggregate principal amount of eoc s senior subordinated notes due  iii repurchase million aggregate accreted value of our senior discount notes due  iv pay million in accrued interest  v pay an estimated million in transaction fees and vi pay million in prepayment and redemption fees 
in connection with the transactions  we incurred an estimated loss of million  consisting of i million for the prepayment and redemption fees  ii million for the write off of deferred debt costs associated with the retired debt  and iii an estimated million in expenses related to the repurchase of indebtedness existing at february  on may   eoc gave notice to redeem the remaining million of principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due these notes will be redeemed at plus accrued and unpaid interest and will be financed with additional borrowings on our new credit facility 
the transaction is expected to close on june  and will result in an additional loss of million 
the new senior credit facility provides for total borrowings of up to billion  including i a million term loan and ii a million revolver  of which million may be used for letters of credit 
the new senior credit facility also provides for the ability to have incremental facilities of up to million  of which up to million may be allocated to a revolver 
eoc issued million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes 
the notes have no sinking fund requirement and are due in full on may  interest is payable semi annually on may and november of each year 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion 
emmis has explored the possibility of separating its radio and television businesses into two publicly traded companies 
emmis continues to monitor the operating environment and evaluate the possibility of effecting a separation 
emmis would consider the separation in connection with a significant acquisition of either radio or television properties 
however  a potential separation is not dependent upon the occurrence of such an event 
intangibles at february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio and television stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future

sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  sfas no 
also changes the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
the company adopted this statement on july  the company has historically used the purchase method to account for all business combinations and the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets that requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets  including broadcast licenses 
under sfas  goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead the recorded value of certain indefinite lived intangibles will be tested for impairment at least annually with impairment being measured as the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and 
table of contents measured for impairment in accordance with sfas in connection with the adoption of sfas effective march   we recorded an impairment loss of million  net of tax  reflected as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the adoption of this accounting standard reduced our amortization of goodwill and intangibles by approximately million in the year ended february  however  our future impairment reviews may result in additional periodic write downs  such as our million impairment loss in fiscal see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations that applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition  construction  or development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset

the company adopted this statement on march  and it did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
effective march   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets that addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it removes certain assets such as deferred tax assets  goodwill and intangible assets not being amortized from its scope and retains the requirements of sfas no 
regarding the recognition of impairment losses on other long lived assets held for use 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas no 
retains the requirement in opinion to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
sfas no 
requires that the liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  not at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december  we adopted sfas no

fin addresses consolidation of business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin is effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  and for the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company has not acquired any variable interest entities subsequent to january  and has no interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
the company will therefore adopt fin in its interim report for the quarter ending may  the company does not expect this pronouncement will have a material impact on its future consolidated results of operations or financial position 
on march   the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying obligation that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
fin s disclosure requirements were effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  fin s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the company adopted the disclosure requirements of fin for its 
table of contents fiscal annual report 
adoption of the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin did not materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or applicable disclosures 
on march   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas no 
also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
this pronouncement requires gains and losses related to debt transactions to be classified in income from continuing operations 
although we did not have any gains or losses from debt transactions in the current year  ecc had recorded an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  in the year ended february   and eoc had recorded an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  in the year ended february   in connection with debt extinguishments 
accordingly  we retroactively reclassified the losses of million for ecc and million for eoc and the related income tax effects to include them in income from continuing operations 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
requires financial instruments within its scope to be classified as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
the provisions of sfas regarding limited life subsidiaries have been deferred indefinitely 
these provisions applied to one of our subsidiaries 
the settlement value of the minority partner s interest in our subsidiary was not material at february  however  the subsidiary is held for sale as of february  seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all of our segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
finally  particularly in our television operations  revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in our odd numbered fiscal years 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operating results  particularly since our senior bank debt is entirely floating rate debt 
risk factors the risk factors listed below  in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report  could affect the business and future results of the company 
past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
decreased spending by advertisers or a decrease in our market ratings or market share can adversely affect our advertising revenues 
we believe that advertising is a discretionary business expense 
spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during an economic recession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending 
consequently  the recent downturn in the united states economy had an adverse effect on our advertising revenue and  therefore  our results of operations 
a recession or another downturn in the united states economy or in the economy of any individual geographic market  particularly a major market such as los angeles  new york or orlando  in which we own and operate sizeable stations  could have a significant effect on us 
the overall weakness of the united states economy resulted in an economic downturn in new york  and the terrorist attacks of september  exacerbated the downturn 
the slow new york economy had an adverse effect on the revenues of our new york stations in the fiscal 
table of contents years ended february  and the new york stations accounted for approximately of our net revenue for the year ended february  even in the absence of a general recession or downturn in the economy  an individual business sector that tends to spend more on advertising than other sectors might be forced to reduce its advertising expenditures if that sector experiences a downturn 
if that sector s spending represents a significant portion of our advertising revenues  any reduction in its advertising expenditures may affect our revenue 
in addition  since political advertising at times accounts for a significant portion of our advertising revenues  normal election cycles may cause our revenues to fluctuate 
changes in government limitations on spending or fundraising for campaign advertisements may also have a negative effect on our earnings derived from political advertising 
we may lose audience share and advertising revenue to competing television and radio stations or other types of media competitors 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
our television and radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other television and radio stations and station groups  as well as with other media 
shifts in population  demographics  audience tastes and other factors beyond our control could cause us to lose market share 
any adverse change in a particular market  or adverse change in the relative market positions of the stations located in a particular market  could have a material adverse effect on our revenue or ratings  could require increased promotion or other expenses in that market  and could adversely affect our revenue in other markets 
other television and radio broadcasting companies may enter the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
our television and radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenue in the face of such competition 
in addition  from time to time  other stations may change their format or programming  a new station may adopt a format to compete directly with our stations for audiences and advertisers  or stations might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns 
these tactics could result in lower ratings and advertising revenue or increased promotion and other expenses and  consequently  lower earnings and cash flow for us 
any failure by us to respond  or to respond as quickly as our competitors  could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
because of the competitive factors we face  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the television and radio broadcasting industries are subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of competition from new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
various new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets  and digital video recorders that allow viewers to digitally record and play back television programming  which may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower our advertising revenues 

table of contents in addition  cable providers and direct broadcast satellite companies are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences  reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets 
competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues 
lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the television and radio broadcasting industries or on our financial condition and results of operations 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
at february   our total indebtedness was approximately  million  and our shareholders equity was approximately million 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates because some of our debt is at variable rates of interest  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our credit facility and our other debt instruments  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 
the terms of our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our direct and indirect subsidiaries may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or to take some actions 
our credit facility and our bond indentures impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  issue preferred stock  incur liens  pay dividends  enter into asset sale transactions  merge or consolidate with another company  dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or make certain other payments or investments 
these restrictions currently limit our ability to grow our business through acquisitions and could limit our ability to respond to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs 
they also could restrict our corporate activities in other ways 
these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 
to service our indebtedness and other obligations  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  to pay dividends and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this ability to generate cash  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our businesses might not generate sufficient cash flow from operations 
we might not be able to complete future offerings  and future borrowings might not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our 
table of contents indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our operating results have been and may again be adversely affected by acts of war and terrorism 
acts of war and terrorism against the united states  and the country s response to such acts  may negatively affect the us advertising market  which could cause our advertising revenues to decline due to advertising cancellations  delays or defaults in payment for advertising time  and other factors 
in addition  these events may have other negative effects on our business  the nature and duration of which we cannot predict 
for example  the war in iraq caused the networks to pre empt regularly scheduled programming in the last month of the first quarter of fiscal and caused several advertisers to cancel their advertising spots  resulting in a loss of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal after the september  terrorist attacks  we decided that the public interest would be best served by the presentation of continuous commercial free coverage of the unfolding events on our stations 
this temporary policy had a material adverse effect on our advertising revenues and operating results for the month of september future events like those of september  or the war in iraq may cause us to adopt similar policies  which could have a material adverse effect on our advertising revenues and operating results 
additionally  the attacks on the world trade center on september  resulted in the destruction of the transmitter facilities that were located there 
although we had no transmitter facilities located at the world trade center  broadcasters that had facilities located in the destroyed buildings experienced temporary disruptions in their ability to broadcast 
since we tend to locate transmission facilities for stations serving urban areas on tall buildings or other significant structures  such as the empire state building in new york  further terrorist attacks or other disasters could cause similar disruptions in our broadcasts in the areas affected 
if these disruptions occur  we may not be able to locate adequate replacement facilities in a cost effective or timely manner or at all 
failure to remedy disruptions caused by terrorist attacks or other disasters and any resulting degradation in signal coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
television programming costs may negatively impact our operating results 
one of our most significant operating cost components is television programming 
we may be exposed in the future to increased programming costs which may adversely affect our operating results 
acquisitions of program rights are usually made two or three years in advance and may require multi year commitments  making it difficult to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  programs must be replaced before their costs have been fully amortized  resulting in write offs that increase station operating costs 
in addition  we have recently experienced increased competition to acquire programming  primarily due to the increased acquisition of syndicated programming by cable operators 
our television stations depend on affiliations with major networks that may be canceled or revoked by the networks 
all of our television stations are affiliated with a network 
under the affiliation agreements  the networks possess  under certain circumstances  the right to terminate the agreement without giving the station enough advance notice to implement a contingency plan 
the affiliation agreements may not remain in place  and the networks may not continue to provide programming to affiliates on the same basis that currently exists 
the non renewal or termination of any of our stations network affiliation agreements could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the success of our television stations depends on the success of the network each station carries 
the ratings of each of the television networks  which is based in large part on their programming  vary from year to year  and this variation can significantly impact a station s revenues 
the future success of any network or its programming is unpredictable 

table of contents to continue to grow our business  we will require significant additional capital 
the continued development  growth and operation of our businesses will require substantial capital 
in particular  additional acquisitions will require large amounts of capital 
we intend to fund our growth  including acquisitions  if any  with cash generated from operations  borrowings under our new credit facility  and proceeds from future issuances of debt and equity both public and private 
our ability to raise additional debt or equity financing is subject to market conditions  our financial condition and other factors 
if we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms when needed  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by competition for suitable properties or other factors we cannot control 
we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions of radio and television stations and publishing properties  when appropriate  in order to grow 
to be successful with this strategy  we must be effective at quickly evaluating markets  obtaining financing to buy stations and publishing properties on satisfactory terms and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals  including  as discussed below  approvals of the fcc and the department of justice 
we also must accomplish these tasks at reasonable costs 
the radio industry in particular has rapidly consolidated 
in general  we compete with many other buyers for radio and television stations as well as publishing properties 
these other buyers may be larger and have more resources 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in buying stations or publishing properties  or whether we will be successful with any station or publishing property we acquire 
our strategy is generally to buy underperforming properties and use our experience to improve their performance 
thus  the benefits resulting from the properties we buy may not manifest themselves immediately  and we may need to pay large initial costs for these improvements 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for future acquisitions  our growth may be impaired 
although part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional radio and television stations  we may not be able to complete all the acquisitions that we agree to make 
station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
also  the fcc sometimes undertakes review of transactions to determine whether they would result in excessive concentration  even where the transaction complies with the numerical ownership limits 
specifically  the staff has had a policy of flagging for closer scrutiny the anticompetitive impact of any transactions that will put one owner in a position to earn or more of the market s radio advertising revenues or will result in the two largest owners receiving or more of those revenues 
while the fcc has noted flagging in public notices in the past  current transactions may be flagged internally by the fcc without public notice 
as discussed below  the fcc s new rules with respect to media ownership are under court review 
we cannot predict how the fcc s approval process will change based on the outcome of the fcc s media ownership proceeding or whether such changes would adversely impact us 
additionally  since the passage of the telecommunications act of  the us department of justice has become more involved in reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations and radio station networks 
the justice department is particularly concerned when the proposed buyer already owns one or more radio stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy 
recently  the justice department has challenged a number of radio broadcasting transactions 
some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring  among other things  divestitures of certain stations 
in general  the justice department has more closely scrutinized radio broadcasting acquisitions that result in local market shares in excess of of radio advertising revenue 
we may not be able to integrate acquired stations successfully  which could affect our financial performance 
our ability to operate our company effectively depends  in part  on our success in integrating acquired stations into our operations 
these efforts may impose significant strains on our management and financial resources 
the pursuit and integration of acquired stations will require substantial attention from our management  and will limit the amount of time they can devote to other important matters 
successful integration of acquired stations will depend primarily on our ability to manage our combined operations 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquired stations or manage our growth or if we encounter unexpected difficulties during expansion  it could have a negative impact on the performance of acquired stations as well as on our company as a whole

under sfas  goodwill and some indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible over its fair value 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and will be measured for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
after initial adoption  any impairment losses under sfas or will be recorded as operating expenses 
in connection with the adoption of sfas effective march   we recorded an impairment loss of million  net of tax  reflected as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the adoption of this accounting standard reduced our amortization of goodwill and intangibles by approximately million in the year ended february  we also incurred a million impairment loss in the fiscal year ended february  as a result of our annual sfas review 
our future impairment reviews could result in additional write downs 
one shareholder controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock  and his interest may conflict with yours 
as of april   our chairman of the board of directors  chief executive officer and president  jeffrey h 
smulyan  beneficially owned shares representing approximately of the outstanding combined voting power of all classes of our common stock  as calculated pursuant to rule d of the exchange act 
he therefore is in a position to exercise a majority of the outstanding combined voting power of all classes of our common stock 
accordingly  mr 
smulyan is able to control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  including the election of a majority of the directors 
the fcc has recently begun more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and pm 
broadcasters risk violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material because of the fcc s broad definition of such material  coupled with the spontaneity of live programming 
recently  the fcc has begun more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry as a whole 
two congressional committees have recently conducted hearings relating to indecency 
legislation has also been introduced in congress that would increase the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming  and depending on the number of violations engaged in  would automatically subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
the fcc has indicated that it is stepping up its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency  and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against broadcast licensees for future serious indecency violations 
the fcc has found on a number of occasions recently  chiefly with regard to radio stations  that the content of broadcasts has contained indecent material 
the fcc issued fines to the offending licensees 
moreover  the fcc has recently begun imposing separate fines for each allegedly indecent utterance  in contrast with its previous policy  which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation 
the fcc has imposed fines totaling  for six allegedly indecent broadcasts at our chicago station  we have filed administrative appeals of four of those fines  totaling  and are currently considering what action  if any  to take regarding the remaining fines  as to which the administrative appeal process has recently concluded 
further  the fcc has sent letters of inquiry to us relating to five additional broadcasts on the chicago station and five broadcasts on one of our st 
louis stations 
these inquiries could result in additional fines or other enforcement action 
in addition  the fcc has dismissed a number of complaints alleging indecent broadcasts at the chicago station  but the complainant has asked the fcc to reinstate eleven of them 
there may also be additional complaints of which we are currently unaware alleging indecent broadcasts by our stations 
the foregoing inquiries and complaints could result in additional fines or other enforcement action 
the fcc has so far assessed fines against us of  for each alleged 
table of contents indecency violation 
during the period since those fines were imposed the commission has frequently imposed fines against broadcasters at the statutory maximum of  per violation  particularly where there have been prior violations 
accordingly  any additional fines imposed on us could be at that level 
moreover  five of the broadcasts which are under inquiry by the fcc are sufficiently recent that they could be subject to the per utterance approach described above  which could increase the total amount of any fines imposed 
if the fcc were to bring enforcement proceedings against any of our television or radio stations  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
further  the alleged violations described above  along with any additional violations that may be asserted by the fcc in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain renewal of the chicago and st 
louis broadcast licenses  for which we must file license renewal applications this year 
the communications act provides that the fcc must renew a broadcast license if i the station involved has served the public interest  convenience and necessity and ii there have been no serious violations of the act or fcc rules  and no other violations of the act or rules which taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
if the commission were to determine that the alleged violations described above fall within either or both of those definitions  the agency could x grant one or both license renewal applications with burdensome conditions  such as requirements for periodic reports  y grant one or both applications for less than the full eight year term in order to allow an early reassessment of the station or stations  or z order an evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge to determine whether renewal of either or both licenses should be denied 
if a station s license renewal were ultimately denied  the station would be required to cease operation permanently 
as a result of these developments  we have implemented measures to reduce the risk of broadcasting indecent material in violation of the fcc s rules 
these and other future modifications to our programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on our competitive position 
our need to comply with comprehensive  complex and sometimes unpredictable federal regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 
we are dependent on licenses from the fcc  which regulates the radio and television broadcasting industries in the united states 
the radio and television broadcasting industries in the united states are subject to extensive and changing regulation by the fcc 
among other things  the fcc is responsible for the following assigning frequency bands for broadcasting  determining the particular frequencies  locations and operating power of stations  issuing  renewing  revoking and modifying station licenses  determining whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulating equipment used by stations  and adopting and implementing regulations and policies that directly affect the ownership  operation  programming and employment practices of stations 
the fcc has the power to impose penalties for violation of its rules or the applicable statutes 
while in the vast majority of cases licenses are renewed by the fcc  we cannot be sure that any of our united states stations licenses will be renewed at their expiration date 
even if our licenses are renewed  we cannot be sure that the fcc will not impose conditions or qualifications that could cause problems in our businesses 
the fcc regulations and policies also affect our growth strategy because the fcc has specific regulations and policies about the number of stations  including radio and television stations  and daily newspapers that an entity may own in any geographic area 
as a result of these rules  we may not be able to acquire more properties in some markets or on the other hand  we may have to sell some of our properties in a particular market 
for example  as a result of our acquisition of lee enterprises in october  we own two top rated television stations in the honolulu market  which is not permitted by fcc rules 
as a result  we have been operating both stations under various temporary waivers to the fcc s ownership rules 
the fcc has adopted new local television ownership rules which continue to prohibit the ownership of two top rated television stations in a single market  and in so doing the fcc ordered companies with temporary waivers including us to file divesting applications to achieve compliance 
however  the implementation of the new rules has been appealed in federal court by a number of broadcasters including us and other groups  and the court has issued 
table of contents an indefinite stay  which has prevented the new rules from becoming effective 
we cannot predict when or how the court will rule on the appeal 
when and if the stay is lifted  we will likely have to either file a divesting application or seek a permanent waiver of the new rules 
if we are required to divest a station on short notice  we may not realize the full value of that station 
as a result of a recent transaction  jeffrey h 
smulyan s voting interest in the company has fallen below for fcc control purposes 
the fcc does not take into account stock options exercisable within days as does the exchange act rule d as a result  the company is no longer eligible for an exemption from the fcc s ownership attribution rules 
therefore  the media interests of minority shareholders who have voting interests in the company of or more or more in the case of certain categories of institutional investors will be attributed to us 
the fcc rules provide for a one year grace period for resolving ownership conflicts resulting from loss of the exemption 
attribution of minority shareholders media interests to us could materially and adversely affect our business as a result of the increased cost of regulatory compliance and monitoring activities  the increased obstacles to our growth strategy or the mandatory divestment of our properties 
further  though we obtained fcc approval for the recent reduction in mr 
smulyan s voting interest  we may need to seek additional approval prior to further material reductions in his interest 
fcc regulations also limit the ability of non us persons to own our capital stock and to participate in our affairs  which could limit our ability to raise equity 
our articles of incorporation contain provisions which place restrictions on the ownership  voting and transfer of our capital stock in accordance with the law 
a court decision invalidated an fcc rule that prohibited common ownership of a broadcast station and a cable television system in the same market 
the elimination of that restriction could increase the amount of competition that our television stations face 
finally  a number of federal rules governing broadcasting have changed significantly in recent years and additional changes may occur  particularly with respect to the rules governing digital television  digital audio broadcasting  satellite radio services  multiple ownership and attribution 
we cannot predict the effect that these regulatory changes may ultimately have on our operations 
any changes in current fcc ownership regulations may negatively impact our ability to compete or otherwise harm our business operations 
in june of  the fcc substantially modified its rules governing ownership of broadcast stations 
the new rules i increase to the national cap on the number of television stations that can be owned nationwide by an entity or affiliated group  ii generally permit common ownership of two television stations within a given market and three stations in some of the largest markets  iii allow  for the first time in many years  common ownership of broadcast stations and daily newspapers in most markets  iv generally allow common ownership of television and radio stations within a given market  and v change the definition of market for purposes of the rules restricting the number of radio stations that may be commonly owned within a given market 
the new rules were appealed in federal court  and in september of  the court stayed the effectiveness of the new rules  pending a decision in the appeal 
as a result of the stay  the former ownership rules were reinstated 
we cannot predict the outcome of the appeal 
recent federal legislation set the national tv ownership cap at  superseding the increase to adopted by the fcc 
this represents an increase from the limit previously in place  and its immediate effect is to allow on a permanent basis the existing levels of station ownership by the fox and cbs networks  which previously had been allowed only as a result of a temporary waiver of the limit 
this may give fox and cbs a competitive advantage over us  since they have much greater financial and other resources than we have 
we cannot predict the impact of these developments on our business 
in particular  we cannot predict the outcome of fcc s media ownership proceeding or its effect on our ability to acquire broadcast stations in the future or to continue to own and freely transfer stations that we have already acquired 
in  we acquired a controlling interest in five fm stations and one am station in the austin  texas market 
under the method of defining radio markets contained in the new ownership rules  it appears that we would be permitted to own or control only four fm stations in the austin market ownership of one am station would continue to be allowed 
the new rules do not require divestiture of existing non conforming station combinations  but do provide that such clusters may be transferred only to defined small business entities 
consequently  if the new rules go into effect and we wish to sell our interest in the austin stations  we will have to either sell to an entity that meets the fcc definition or exclude at least one fm station from the transaction 
as a result of the lee enterprises acquisition  we own two top rated television stations in the honolulu market 
the new ownership rules  like the former rules  generally prohibit common ownership of such stations  and in adopting the new rules  the fcc 
table of contents ordered companies that had requested temporary waivers including us to file divesting applications to achieve compliance 
when and if the court stay of the new rules is lifted  we will likely have to either file a divesting application or request a permanent waiver of the new rules 
if we are required to divest a station on short notice  we may not realize the full value of that station 
our business strategy and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued services of our key employees  the loss of whom could materially adversely affect our business 
our ability to maintain our competitive position depends to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and certain key employees 
their managerial  technical and other services would be difficult to replace and if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel 
our business could be seriously harmed if one of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise competes directly or indirectly against us 
our radio and television stations employ or independently contract with several on air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio and television programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas 
these on air personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a station  and thus  the ability of the station to sell advertising 
these individuals may not remain with our radio and television stations and may not retain their audiences 
our current and future operations are subject to certain risks that are unique to operating in a foreign country 
we currently have several international operations  including a interest in a national radio station in hungary and operations in belgium and  therefore  we are exposed to risks inherent in international business operations 
we may pursue opportunities to buy additional broadcasting properties in other foreign countries 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include the following changing regulatory or taxation policies  currency exchange risks  changes in diplomatic relations or hostility from local populations  seizure of our property by the government  or restrictions on our ability to transfer our property or earnings out of the foreign country  potential instability of foreign governments  which might result in losses against which we are not insured  and difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems 
you may be unable to pursue any legal claims against arthur andersen llp  our former independent public accountants 
our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ending february  and were audited by arthur andersen llp  our former independent public accountant 
arthur andersen llp was convicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the federal government s investigation of enron corp 
in light of the conviction  arthur andersen ceased practicing before the sec on august  as a result  arthur andersen llp has not reissued its audit report with respect to our consolidated financial statements 
further  arthur andersen llp has not consented to the inclusion of its audit report in our various shelf registration statements currently in effect 
as a result  our current and future security holders may not have an effective remedy against arthur andersen llp in connection with a material misstatement or omission in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ending february  and even if our security holders were able to assert such a claim  because arthur andersen llp s operations have ceased  there will likely be insufficient assets to satisfy claims made by investors or by us that might arise under federal securities laws or otherwise

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage interest rate exposure emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended in june of by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these statements  which were effective for emmis on march   establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
these statements require that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction  and on the type of hedge transaction 
gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in the other comprehensive income must be reclassified as earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item  and the ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized in earnings in the current period 
these standards result in additional volatility in reported assets  liabilities  earnings and other comprehensive income 
sfas no 
requires that as of the date of initial adoption the difference between the fair value of the derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet and the previous carrying amount of those derivatives be reported in net income or other 
table of contents comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb accounting changes 
on march   emmis recorded the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
which resulted in an immaterial impact to the results of operations and the financial position of emmis 
sfas no 
further requires that the fair value and effectiveness of each hedging instrument must be measured quarterly 
the result of each measurement could result in fluctuations in reported assets  liabilities  other comprehensive income and earnings as these changes in fair value and effectiveness are recorded to the financial statements 
interest rates at february   the entire outstanding balance under our credit facility  approximately of eoc s total outstanding debt credit facility and senior subordinated debt and of emmis total outstanding debt eoc s debt plus our senior discount notes  bears interest at variable rates 
the credit facility requires eoc to have fixed interest rates for a two year period on at least of its total outstanding debt  as defined including the senior subordinated debt  if eoc s total leverage ratio  as defined  is greater than at any quarter end 
eoc currently has no interest rate swap arrangements as its total leverage ratio  as defined  was less than as of february  based on amounts outstanding at february   if the interest rate on our variable debt were to increase by  our annual interest expense would be higher by approximately million 
foreign currency emmis owns a interest in a hungarian subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency forint 
emmis has a natural hedge against currency fluctuations between the forint and the us dollar since most of the subsidiary s long term obligations are denominated in hungarian forints 
emmis owns nine radio stations in belgium  which are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements  and its investment to date is approximately million 
these subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currency euro 
emmis owns a interest in an argentinean subsidiary  but emmis has agreed to sell its interest to the minority partner 
consequently  the operations for this subsidiary have been classified as discontinued operations and the assets are classified as held for sale as of february  while emmis management cannot predict the most likely average or end of period forint to dollar  or euro to dollar exchange rates for calendar  we believe any devaluation of the forint or euro would have an immaterial effect on our financial statements taken as a whole  as the hungarian and belgium stations accounted for approximately of emmis total revenues and approximately of emmis total assets as of  and for the year ended  february  at february   the hungarian subsidiary had million of us dollar denominated loans outstanding 
the hungarian subsidiary repaid million of us dollar denominated loans during fiscal the argentinean subsidiary had no us dollar denominated loans outstanding during fiscal or at february  emmis currently does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
