executive overview we formed regent in november to acquire  own and operate clusters of radio stations in mid sized and small markets 
our primary objective is to increase regent s value to our stockholders by growing the number of radio stations and markets in which we operate and by improving the financial performance of the stations we own and operate in those markets 
we measure our progress by evaluating our ability to continue to increase the number of stations we own and to improve the post acquisition performance of the radio stations that we acquire 
growth in radio stations and markets 
since our inception  we have negotiated separate transactions for the acquisition and disposition of radio stations in various markets 
we have grown rapidly to our current size of radio stations in fifteen markets 
we achieved this growth through completed and pending acquisitions of stations in markets and the sale or exchange of stations in eleven markets 
we expect to continue to grow our company by entering new markets where we see growth potential 

table of contents additionally  we seek to continue to strategically upgrade our presence in each of our markets through additional acquisitions and to continue to enhance our radio portfolio by selling or exchanging existing stations for stations in markets where there is more opportunity for growth 
of our radio station portfolio  stations have been owned or operated by our company for less than three years 
we consider this group as being in the start up or developmental stages and are the stations that have the most opportunity for improved results going forward 
our strategy is illustrated by our february acquisition of radio stations in four markets from brill media company llc 
that acquisition positioned us to negotiate the following additional four complementary transactions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which strengthened our position in certain markets and allowed us to enter a new  more attractive market the exchange of four radio stations in duluth  minnesota that we had acquired in the brill transaction  for five radio stations serving the evansville  indiana market  a market that we already have a presence in through the brill transaction 
this transaction was completed in january the pending purchase of two radio stations serving the ft 
collins greeley  colorado market  one of which we began providing programming and other services to in february the exchange of six radio stations we currently own in two markets  erie and lancaster  pennsylvania for five radio stations serving the bloomington  illinois market 
in february  we began providing programming and other services to the stations we intend to acquire  and the purchaser of the stations we intend to sell began providing the same such services to those stations 
the pending transaction in ft 
collins greeley in which we will receive million in cash  net of our costs  from another operator to move our antenna off the ktrr fm tower to our kuad fm tower  which will enable us to have a better signal into the ft 
collins greeley market as well as relieve us of the long term lease obligation on the ktrr tower 
in order to fuel our growth  we have obtained funds from a variety of financing transactions  including our january initial public offering  our november private placement of common stock  our april public offering of common stock  and our credit facilities from financial institutions 
after giving effect to our pending transactions  we currently have available million under our current credit facilities for future acquisitions and other purposes  subject to the terms and conditions of our credit facility 
additionally  subject to market conditions  regent s financial performance and other factors  we have the ability to quickly access the public markets for up to approximately million through additional public offerings of common or preferred stock and or various debt securities pursuant to our currently effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission 
performance of our stations and markets 
the principal source of our revenue is the sale of broadcasting time on our radio stations for advertising 
our revenue is driven primarily by the amount of advertising time that we sell and the advertising rates that our radio stations are able to charge 
the advertising rates are based upon a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic arbitron radio market reports 
in evaluating the performance of our various radio stations in our various markets  we focus on same station results as well as overall growth in our revenues and profitability 
we believe that meaningful quarter to quarter comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we have been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of stations acquired or disposed of during those periods 
additionally  barter is excluded in this 
table of contents comparison  as it customarily results in volatility between quarters  although differences over the full year are not material 
the advertising environment for radio in was comparable to  as advertiser demand for air time was sluggish 
the war in iraq slowed what appeared to be a promising first quarter after a relatively strong start in january and february of the war  combined with the lingering events of september  and generally weak economic conditions  created a difficult two year period for the radio industry as a whole  including regent 
we anticipate that the demand for advertising will improve somewhat in while political advertising was less than of our revenue stream in  we expect to see a bigger impact in as it is a presidential election year 
we also anticipate that the olympics will generate additional radio advertising because some advertisers will be unable to obtain television airtime for advertising and typically look to increased radio advertising as an alternative 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  the ability to provide popular programming  local market and regional competition  relative efficiency of radio broadcasting compared to other advertising media  signal strength and government regulation and policies 
from time to time  the markets in which we operate experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect our revenue 
we believe  however  that this impact is somewhat mitigated by our diverse geographical presence 
our financial results are seasonal 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter to produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter to produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
to enhance the operations of our stations we have organized oversight of the radio stations into four regions with a regional vice president responsible for the operations in each region as well as their own market 
the synergies and idea sharing that has been generated by this alignment has been strategic as we continue to develop our stations 
additionally  we have invested in our corporate infrastructure to accommodate our acquisition strategy 
we believe that we are well positioned to rapidly and significantly increase the size of our company  with relatively minimal increases in corporate overhead 
prior to  and excluding gains on the sale or exchange of radio stations  we have historically generated net losses  primarily as a result of significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization relating to the acquisitions of radio stations and interest charges on outstanding debt 
the fcc licenses and goodwill attributable to substantially all of our radio stations have historically been amortized on a straight line method over a to year period 
upon adoption of sfas in january  we ceased amortizing all goodwill and fcc licenses 
additionally  the goodwill and fcc licenses that we recorded for acquisitions that we completed subsequent to july   were not amortized due to this new guidance 
based upon the large number of acquisitions we consummated within the last three years  we anticipate that depreciation charges will continue to be significant for several years 
to the extent that we complete additional acquisitions  our interest expense and depreciation charges related to property and equipment and other intangible assets are likely to increase 
the sarbanes oxley act of section the sarbanes oxley act of was enacted on july   largely in response to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals involving some of the largest and well known companies in the 
table of contents united states 
in the second half of and in fiscal year  we have expended significant internal resources to comply with the new corporate governance mandates contained in this law and related regulations adopted by the securities and exchange commission  the department of labor and the nasdaq national market 
section of the sarbanes oxley act becomes effective this year and it requires that by december   we must document and test the internal controls over financial reporting  form an evaluation  based on sufficient evidence  as to the overall effectiveness of our system of internal controls over financial reporting and  issue an annual assertion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting beginning with the year ended december  we will incur approximately million in increased costs in to comply with section and we are uncertain as to the long term cost effects at this time 
our external auditors must review the work performed by management and perform independent tests of the internal controls and will then issue a report on internal control over financial reporting 
we are currently in the process of documenting all of the financial processes and internal controls in all of our radio stations as well as in the corporate office and anticipate testing our controls in the second quarter of any weaknesses in our internal controls that are found during the testing will be remediated and then retested 
we believe that we will be in full compliance with section by the end of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  allocating the purchase price of acquisitions  evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets  determining the recoverability of our long lived assets and evaluating our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets our fcc licenses qualify as indefinite lived intangible assets  and represent a significant portion of the assets on our balance sheet 
we apply a fair value approach employing a discounted cash flow methodology to test impairment of both indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill on a market by market basis 
to arrive at a value for discounted cash flow of a market  management relies upon estimates of future cash flows and the effects of changes in business conditions 
local economic conditions in each of our markets could impact whether an fcc license or goodwill is impaired  as a decrease or increase in market revenue could negatively or positively impact discounted cash flows 
additionally  other factors such as interest rates  the performance of the s p  as well as capital expenditures can affect the discounted cash flow analysis 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  an impairment loss will be recorded in operating income 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets to be held and used fixed assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
if we were to determine that the carrying amount of an asset was not recoverable  we would record an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of our long lived assets based upon the market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if necessary 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
the amount of intangibles with definite lives that we have recorded is not material 
deferred tax assets at december   we had a deferred tax asset of approximately million before valuation allowance  the primary component of which is our net operating loss carryforwards 
while we have a valuation allowance of million set up for tax assets expiring through  we have determined that it is not necessary to record a valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards for years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration the run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and deductible goodwill by however  there is no assurance that our projections will be achieved  and if our taxable income projections fall short  we most likely would need to record additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that would not be utilized 
the need to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is reviewed quarterly  and if we were to determine that we would be unable to realize a portion  or the remainder of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if it were determined that we would be able to utilize a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that are reserved for in the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction of expense 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate due to unfavorable law changes or unforeseen circumstances  we could experience losses in excess of the current or deferred income tax provisions we have established 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we routinely review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
a one percent change to our 
table of contents allowance as a percent of our outstanding accounts receivable at december  would cause a decrease in net income of approximately million  net of tax 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity by now requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities or assets in some circumstances in the balance sheet 
sfas affects an entity s classification of mandatorily redeemable instruments  financial instruments to repurchase an entity s own equity instruments and financial instruments embodying obligations that the issuer must or could choose to settle by issuing a variable number of its shares or other equity instruments based entirely on a fixed monetary amount known at inception or something other than changes in its own equity instruments 
the company adopted sfas effective june   with no impact to the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
under its currently effective shelf registration statement  the company has the ability to offer for sale financial instruments with characteristics of both debt and equity 
if the company were to issue such instruments  the provisions of sfas would be applied 
results of operations the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years are discussed and analyzed in the following paragraphs 
this commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein 
compared to results from operations in  as compared to  were affected considerably by full year results for our acquisitions in evansville  indiana  ft 
collins greeley  colorado and lancaster  pennsylvania which we began operating in september  and to a lesser extent our acquisitions of radio stations in flint and grand rapids  michigan see note in the notes to the financial statements 
additionally  in march  we began operating five additional stations in evansville  indiana under a time brokerage agreement with clear channel broadcasting  inc and its related affiliates 
accordingly  the results of our operations in are not comparable to those of the prior period  nor are they necessarily indicative of future results 
net broadcast revenues the radio industry has experienced a difficult last few years as the effects of september   the war on terrorism  the war in iraq and other related events  negatively impacted the advertising environment 
overall advertising growth has remained somewhat flat in with national business showing larger growth than local business 
we have felt the impact of such matters and we believe our financial performance is comparable to the radio industry as a whole 
however  the national growth was not as significant to us as national advertising only represents approximately of our revenue 
additionally  eleven of our markets are over in terms of market revenue rank where national business growth was not as significant as in the larger markets 
accordingly  our results were much more impacted by locally driven revenues 
net broadcast revenues of approximately million in represented a increase over net revenues of approximately million 
approximately million of the increase was 
table of contents attributable to full year results for stations we acquired in results for the stations we began operating under time brokerage agreements in contributed approximately million of the net revenue increase  and the difference was due to revenue decreases at stations we owned for both years 
the increase in net revenue in of million was comprised primarily of million of local revenue  million of national revenue  million of non traditional broadcast revenue  and million of non cash barter revenue 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in political revenues of million  as was an off election year  and other miscellaneous revenue of million 
the evansville stations that we exchanged for the duluth stations accounted for revenue generated during that was not in our revenue  although that effect was somewhat mitigated by our operation of the duluth stations from september through december station operating expenses operating expenses were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in the increase is primarily a result of full year results for the stations we acquired in  which represented approximately million of the increase  as well as expenses for the stations we purchased or operated under time brokerage agreements in  which added approximately million of additional operating expense 
the remaining million of cost reduction was attributable to cost savings at the stations we have owned for all of and part of the savings was attributable to compensation savings as a result of the revenue shortfalls 
as was a difficult year for advertising revenue  it was important for us to balance our investment spending with cost control 
our discretionary dollars remained relatively flat to prior year spending 
we have continued to invest in research and promotional expenses  which we incur to properly target our intended demographic audiences within our markets  as well as to promote our radio stations through various advertising campaigns and contest prize give aways  as we believe these expenditures will promote long term growth at our radio stations 
expenses directly related to the generation of revenue such as sales commissions increased approximately million 
the administrative costs required to operate the facilities at our markets such as power and rent increased by approximately million and our compensation and benefits expenses increased by approximately million 
non cash barter expense increased by million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by  from approximately million in  to approximately million in this was primarily due to increased depreciation expense related to acquisitions that were closed during and the second half of corporate expense corporate general and administrative expenses in total remained relatively flat in compared to however  variances occurred within various accounts 
those variances include increases in payroll expense due to annual performance increases  travel and entertainment  technology communications expense as a result of the addition of four markets purchased from brill media  management conferences not held in the prior year  and increased rent expense primarily as a result of the termination of the sublease of our old office space 
these increases were offset by an approximate decrease in incentive compensation due to the difficult business revenue environment in 
table of contents interest expense interest expense increased by from million in to million in the increase was due to debt that was incurred to close the brill transaction in february  as well as the write off of approximately million in unamortized deferred finance costs related to our old credit facility 
average outstanding long term debt balances in were million compared to million in the increase in interest expense was somewhat mitigated by a lower weighted average interest rate in of compared to in income taxes we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in representing a effective rate 
the rate includes a state rate of approximately as well as the federal rate 
additionally  was attributed to a small valuation allowance we recorded for state net operating losses generated in and miscellaneous adjustments accounted for a decrease of 
we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in  prior to the income tax benefit from cumulative effect of accounting change 
this represented a federal rate and a state rate  and included million of income tax expense related to the establishment of valuation allowances on our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire in the years through in arriving at the determination as to the amount of the valuation allowance required for the year ended december   we considered the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from purchase transactions  statutory restrictions on the use of operating losses  and a tax planning strategy available to us 
we determined that when considering the current state of private market values for radio station assets  it would be more likely than not that we would not be able to implement our tax planning strategy within the foreseeable future resulting in the establishment of the valuation allowance 
we determined that it was not necessary in to record additional valuation allowance against our federal net operating loss carryforwards for years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration the run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and deductible goodwill by we have cumulative federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately million at december   which expire in the years through the utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes is limited  pursuant to the annual utilization limitations provided under the provisions of internal revenue code section same station results our revenues are produced exclusively by our radio stations and we believe that an analysis of the revenue of stations that we owned for the full years and is important because it presents a more direct view of whether or not our stations are operating effectively 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for broadcast net revenue  operating income loss  net income loss  net cash provided by used in operating activities or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
while acquisitions have affected the comparability of our operating results to those of  we believe meaningful quarter to quarter net broadcast revenue comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we have been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of markets disposed of 
table of contents during those years 
the following comparable results between and includes the results of stations in twelve markets and are listed in the table below by quarter  excluding the effect of barter transactions dollars in thousands 
quarter net revenue net revenue change net broadcast revenue less remaining stations and barter effect same station net broadcast revenue revenue for the first quarter of was negatively impacted by the war in iraq  as march was particularly affected after two fairly successful months in january and february 
in addition  we had a very successful first quarter of  making comparable revenue growth in difficult  given the economic climate 
also  we had political revenue of approximately  in the first quarter of that we did not have in the first quarter of quarter net revenue net revenue change net broadcast revenue less remaining stations and barter effect same station net broadcast revenue revenue for the second quarter was slightly down compared to the prior year quarter results  as advertising economic conditions showed continued negative impact from the war 
april revenue exceeded prior year and may and june were down and  respectively 
additionally  we had a non traditional broadcast revenue shortfall of approximately  quarter net revenue net revenue change net broadcast revenue less remaining stations and barter effect same station net broadcast revenue the weakness in the advertising economy continued into the third quarter of as revenue was lower by million compared to local revenue was flat compared to the prior year third quarter and national was favorable by 
non traditional broadcast revenue was down by approximately million  half of which was related to two events that were cancelled in but were included in results 
political revenue was down by approximately million compared to the third quarter of 
table of contents quarter net revenue net revenue change net broadcast revenue less remaining stations and barter effect same station net broadcast revenue net revenue for the fourth quarter of showed some modest improvement in the advertising environment as october was down and november and december were flat compared to the fourth quarter of local revenue was up and political revenue was down by approximately million as forth quarter had some hotly contested elections in some of our markets 
additionally  non traditional broadcast revenue was down by approximately million compared to the fourth quarter of compared to results from operations in  as compared to  were affected considerably by full year results for our acquisitions in peoria  illinois  lafayette  louisiana  and to a lesser extent  erie  pennsylvania  and our acquisitions of radio stations in flint and grand rapids  michigan  as well as the disposition of our stations in palmdale  california 
additionally  in september  we began operating the brill media stations under time brokerage agreements 
accordingly  the results of our operations in are not comparable to those of the prior period  nor are they necessarily indicative of future results 
additionally  our results for the third and fourth quarters of were negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks 
net broadcast revenues net broadcast revenues were approximately million in  a increase over net revenues of approximately million 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to full year results for stations we acquired in results for the stations we acquired or began operations under time brokerage agreements in contributed approximately million of the net revenue increase  and the remainder was due to revenue increases at stations we owned for both years  offset partially by the sale of our palmdale  california stations during station operating expenses operating expenses were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in the increase is primarily a result of full year results for the stations we acquired in  which represented approximately million of the increase  as well as expenses for the stations we purchased or operated under time brokerage agreements in  which added approximately million of additional operating expense 
a significant portion of the increase in our operating expense was due to research and promotional expenses we incurred to properly target our intended demographic audiences within our markets  as well as to promote our radio stations through various advertising campaigns and contest prize give aways  which we believe will promote long term growth at our radio stations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by from approximately million in 
table of contents to approximately million in effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite life  and also requires an annual impairment testing of those assets 
amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was approximately million  net of income taxes  for the year ended december  corporate expenses corporate general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was due to a combination of the following salary components of two employees who were charged at the market level in and were charged to corporate expense in  due to our ability to leverage those resources at the corporate level  increased legal expenses  implementation of and compliance with various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase in director s and officer s insurance premiums  and cash compensation paid to outside directors for their service on the company s board of directors  a policy which began in impairment of goodwill in conjunction with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  it was determined that the fair value of goodwill for our peoria  illinois market was less than the carrying value of the goodwill recorded in our financial statements 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of income taxes  against operating income 
gain on sale on long lived assets on march   we completed the sale of wgna am in albany  new york for million in cash 
we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately  on the sale 
we treated the disposal of wgna am as the disposal of long lived assets  rather than a business or a component of a business  due to the fact that the stations had no independent revenue stream from its operations 
interest expense interest expense decreased by in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of the paydown of outstanding debt under our credit facility with proceeds from our april stock offering 
also contributing to the decrease was lower interest rates throughout  as compared to the weighted average interest rate for the year was  compared to for the year 
the weighted average interest rate at december  was  as compared to an average interest rate of at december  gain on sale of radio stations on june   we completed the sale of our three stations in palmdale  california to concord media group  inc we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million on this transaction  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  income taxes we recorded income tax expenses of approximately million in  prior to the income tax benefit from cumulative effect of accounting change 
this represents a federal rate and a state rate  
table of contents and includes million of income tax expense related to the establishment of valuation allowances on our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire in the years through we had cumulative federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately million at december   which expire in the years through the utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes is limited  pursuant to the annual utilization limitations provided under the provisions of internal revenue code section in arriving at the determination as to the amount of the valuation allowance required for the years ended december  and  we considered the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from purchase transactions  statutory restrictions on the use of operating losses  and a tax planning strategy available to us 
consequently  during the second half of  we determined that when considering the current state of private market values for radio stations assets  it would be more likely than not that we would not be able to implement our tax planning strategy within the foreseeable future 
cumulative effect of accounting change upon the adoption of sfas  we completed a transitional impairment analysis of our indefinite lived fcc licenses and recorded an impairment of approximately million  net of income tax benefit of approximately million 
additionally  we completed the two step transitional impairment analysis of goodwill and recorded impairment loss of approximately million  net of income tax benefit of approximately million 
to estimate fair value  we used a discounted cash flow methodology 
these losses are reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources executive overview since our inception  we have demonstrated our ability to access the public markets to raise capital for acquisitions as discussed above 
we have also negotiated three separate credit facilities with a number of banking institutions  with the most recent credit facility being put in place in june we believe that we have sufficient access to funds so that we will be able to continue to pursue our growth strategy during our liquidity has been supported by a strong credit policy that has enabled the company to keep write offs of accounts receivable to approximately of net revenue or lower in the last three years 
additionally  our accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased the last three years from days in to days in  which was further strengthened in by the implementation of a bonus program for the business offices in our radio stations  which is based on certain criteria related to the collection of accounts receivables 
we expect the long term liquidity of the company to be strong  as radio stations typically do not have large capital requirements 
excluding consolidation projects  where we consolidate duplicate facilities in a market  our capital expenditures have been approximately of our net revenue 
additionally  we have maintained a disciplined acquisition approach that has enabled us to consistently keep our debt leverage under our bank covenant levels 
one half of our outstanding term loan is on a fixed interest rate through june and the other half is variable rate 
our interest rates are based on libor rates and we had a weighted average interest rate in of 
our term loan begins to reduce on december  with an initial payment of approximately million and continues quarterly thereafter to termination 
the revolving credit facility begins to reduce on june  and continues thereafter to termination 
we believe the cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to complete our pending acquisition and to meet our requirements for corporate expenses and 
table of contents capital expenditures for the remainder of  based on our projected operations and indebtedness and giving effect to scheduled credit facility commitment reductions 
after giving effect to all completed and pending asset transactions  at december   outstanding borrowings under our existing credit facility would be approximately million  with available borrowings of approximately million  subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility 
we have the capability to borrow up to a leverage ratio of through and at december  our debt leverage ratio including all pending transactions was 
upon the completion of our pending transactions in bloomington  illinois and ft 
collins greeley  colorado  where we will likely borrow on our revolving credit facility  we expect the long term cash needs of the company to be satisfied by cash from operating activities  including the scheduled reductions of our credit facility 
we will further reassess our long term cash requirements as additional acquisitions may be identified 
discussion of consolidated statements of cash flows our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in deposits in transit that is related to improvements in our cash management system through migration to a lockbox collection process 
consolidated cash balances are typically maintained between one to two million dollars as excess cash generated by operating activities after investing activities is utilized to pay down the revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in representing an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to the operating activities of radio stations acquired or operated under time brokerage agreements in and in the latter part of the increase in accounts receivable reduced net cash from operating activities by million in compared to million in the increase in the accounts receivable was due primarily to the increase of the brill station accounts receivables that we began operating in september cash flow used in investing activities was approximately million in compared to approximately million in the increase in was due primarily to the acquisition of the brill stations in capital expenditures were higher in by approximately million due to consolidation projects in flint and peoria and new facilities in utica 
cash flows provided by financing activities were approximately million in  compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million in the increase in reflects the borrowing of funds to close the brill transaction in during  proceeds received from our april stock offering and the final proceeds received from our november private placement of equity were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility 
sources of funds in  our sources of cash totaled approximately million  including million borrowed to pay off the old credit facility  and were derived from a combination of cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under our new credit facility net of financing costs  and  to a much lesser extent  net proceeds from the sale of long lived assets 
on june   we entered into a new senior secured reducing credit agreement with a group of lenders that provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount of million  consisting of a senior 
table of contents secured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of million and a senior secured term loan facility in the amount of million 
the credit facility includes a commitment to issue letters of credit of up to million in aggregate face amount  subject to the maximum revolving commitment available 
regent incurred approximately million in financing costs related to the new credit facility  which are being amortized over the life of the facility using the effective interest method 
the new credit facility is available for working capital and permitted acquisitions  including related acquisition costs
