item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements  including the related notes  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements 
overview our business is organized into three segments timber  paper and paperboard  and converted products 
we benefit from significant integration between our business segments 
during fiscal year  our paper and paperboard segment obtained approximately of its wood chips from logs that were harvested from our timberlands and chipped by our chipping operations 
in the same period  our converted products segment effectively obtained approximately of its paper and paperboard requirements from our longview mill  representing approximately of total mill production 
in addition  our business segments share centralized corporate management  accounting  human resources and information systems support 
our fiscal year ends on october net sales for individual segments are reported net of intercompany transfers 
segment operating profits reflect allocations of selling  general and administrative expenses on the basis of the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
in the case of intercompany transfers of products between segments  cost of products sold is based upon transfer pricing policies that we believe assist us in managing and optimizing the consolidated financial performance of our business as a whole 
for example  paperboard acquired from our paper mill and used in our converting operations is assigned a transfer price equal to the paper mill s cost  except that paperboard purchased through buy sell agreements is assigned a price equal to the cost from the third party 
see selected segment results below for a more detailed discussion of these arrangements 
depending on market conditions  our transfer pricing practices may understate or overstate the actual price at which we could have sold those products into the open market or the actual price in the open market at which we could have purchased the raw materials used to produce those products 
as a consequence  these allocations and transfer pricing policies sometimes result in individual segment results that do not reflect the financial performance that would have resulted for a segment operating as a stand alone business 
our timber segment owns and operates timberlands in oregon and washington and produces logs for sale in the domestic and export markets 
during fiscal year  our domestic customers consisted of approximately independent sawmills and plywood plants 
results of operations for our timber segment also include our sawmill 
net sales of our timber segment are primarily affected by housing starts and other construction activity in the domestic and japanese markets 
construction activity is influenced by mortgage interest rates and general economic conditions in those markets 
net sales in this segment are also affected by supply side factors such as government regulation restricting the harvest of timber from public and certain private lands and competition from logs supplied by foreign producers  especially canadian producers 
the strength of the japanese export market can significantly influence the results of our timber segment since our sales into that market tend to be at higher prices than sales into the domestic market 
because all of our sales are us dollar denominated  our export sales are also significantly influenced by the relative strength of the us dollar 
cost of products sold in the timber segment primarily include contract logging expense  the cost of operating our sawmill  and depletion  which is based on the historical cost of timber that is harvested 
our paper and paperboard segment produces a wide variety of paper and paperboard at our longview mill 
we sell our paper and paperboard products to a number of domestic and export customers 
in fiscal year  our converted products segment obtained approximately of our mill s paper and paperboard page output  either by direct shipment from our mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements 
net sales in the paper and paperboard segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states and southeast asia and the relative strength of the us dollar 
average prices in this segment have also been favorably affected by industry capacity rationalization over the last several years 
the demand for certain specialty products manufactured by our paper and paperboard segment tends to be less dependent on the economic cycles affecting the commodity paper market 
the major component of cost of products sold for the paper and paperboard segment is fiber  which consists primarily of wood chips  but also includes sawdust and recycled materials 
we have invested in processes that allow us to use an increased proportion of less expensive sawdust and recycled materials in making our paper and paperboard products 
cost of products sold also includes labor  energy and chemicals used in processing 
our converted products segment produces corrugated containers  solid fiber boxes  creative point of purchase displays  handle shopping bags and merchandise bags 
nearly all of our converted products are sold domestically for end uses that include packaging for consumables such as fresh and frozen produce and beverages  as well as for toys  furniture and electronics 
net sales in the converted products segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states 
the primary constituent materials for converted products are paper and paperboard 
our converted products segment obtained approximately of its paper and paperboard requirements from our longview mill  either by direct shipment from our mill or from shipments under barter or buy sell agreements 
cost of products sold also includes energy  labor  ink and glue 
our longview mill contains six steam driven generators and one natural gas fired co generation facility  all of which are capable of producing electrical power 
in the past  we elected  based on the relationship between rates we could obtain for third party sales of electricity and the cost to us of purchasing electricity and natural gas  to sell a significant percentage of the electricity that we generated into the market and to allocate the operating profit from those sales to the paper and paperboard and converted products segments based on the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
the primary contracts pursuant to which we purchased and sold power expired in fiscal year and  under current terms  we have significantly less flexibility in selling and using power generated by our facilities 
during the first fiscal quarter of  we elected to sell electrical power  but we discontinued the sale in january due to poor margins 
we also sold a minor amount of electrical power in the fourth quarter of fiscal year electrical power sales for fiscal year were million producing an operating loss of million 
we allocated the operating loss to our manufacturing segments with a loss of million to the paper and paperboard segment and a loss of million to our converted products segment 
we sold no power in fiscal year our future decisions concerning electrical power generation  including the extent to which we operate our co generation facility for sales into the market  will change from period to period based on market conditions 
we do not expect sales of power to meaningfully contribute to our results in the coming year 
we can curtail the operation of certain of our equipment and facilities from time to time to provide us with flexibility in managing our operations and cost structure 
in order to meet market conditions and to maximize the efficient use of our paper machines  we fully curtailed three of our twelve paper machines for all of fiscal year and for substantially all of fiscal year in addition  given market conditions  we curtail the operation of certain of our converting facilities if we believe it is advantageous to do so

fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results net sales 
fiscal year net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year net sales increased as a result of an increase in net sales in our paper and paperboard segment of million  or  partially offset by a decrease in net sales in our timber segment of million  or  a decrease in net sales in our converted segment of million  or  and a decrease of million in net sales of internally generated power to third parties 
see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of an decrease in steam costs resulting from the use of additional low cost biomass fuel  a per unit decrease in natural gas cost  and a per unit decrease in fuel oil cost  partially offset by a per unit increase in cost of electrical power purchased from third parties  and a increase in occ costs 
in addition  cost of goods sold was negatively affected by a million decrease in pension income allocated to cost of products sold to million from million in fiscal year average wood chip costs remained level with fiscal our business process improvement initiatives to improve customer service  reduce inventories and lower procurement costs have contributed favorably to cost reductions in fiscal our cost of products sold also includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the depletion cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year fiscal year costs were negatively affected by a million decrease in page allocated pension income to million compared with million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by less expense associated with our business process improvement initiative and our enterprise resource planning system

see provision for taxes on income below 
provision for taxes on income 
fiscal year provision for income taxes was million  reflecting a tax rate of

for the reasons noted above  net income increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  representing a increase 
selected segment results timber fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease timber net sales  millions timber operating profit  millions logs  thousands of board feet   lumber  thousands of board feet   logs  thousand board feet lumber  thousand board feet fiscal year timber net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in log volume sold and a decrease in log prices  partially offset by an increase in lumber prices of and an increase in lumber volume of 
the log volume decline in fiscal year was primarily due to the decision to begin reducing harvest levels from the increased level of fiscal year and harvest restrictions caused by unusually dry weather conditions in the third fiscal quarter as a consequence of the weakening of the us dollar relative to the yen  export prices improved over fiscal  while domestic prices decreased a modest 
fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales compared with million  or  for fiscal year this decline was a result of decreases in export log volume of and less lumber sold in the export market 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reasons for this decline were the reduced log volume sold  an increase in logging costs  and a increase in depletion costs  due to harvesting from counties with higher depletion rates  partially offset by an increase in average lumber prices and an increase in lumber volume 
page paper and paperboard fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard net sales  millions paper and paperboard operating loss  millions paper  tons   paperboard  tons   paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to a and increase in paperboard volume and price  and a increase in paper volume 
in first fiscal quarter  we renegotiated a long standing barter agreement whereby we swapped equivalent units of paper for paperboard 
the new buy sell agreement provides that we now sell paper and paperboard to our counterpart s converting facilities  and we now purchase paperboard from them for our midwest converting facilities 
in addition to this new agreement  in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we made a similar change from another barter agreement wherein we now sell paperboard to the counterpart s converting facilities and we now buy paperboard for certain of our converting facilities 
as a result of the new agreements  we had a increase in paper and paperboard net sales over fiscal  and a increase in paper and paperboard volume over fiscal we continue to maintain our focus on market niches that tend to have higher and more stable sales price dynamics and offer higher value added products for customers  such as our tea kraft semi extensible paper for use in multiwall bags 
demand and pricing improved in fiscal for tea kraft with volume up and sales up over fiscal year fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year export paper and paperboard volume increased and  respectively  and export paper and paperboard prices increased and  respectively  compared to year ago levels 
these volume and price increases are the result of improved demand for our products and the positive pricing benefits of the weaker us dollar 
fiscal year paper and paperboard operating loss was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year in fiscal year  we allocated losses of million to the segment as a result of power sales  but had no power sales in fiscal year operating results were favorably impacted by a price increase for paperboard of  paper and paperboard volume increases of and  respectively  an decrease in steam costs resulting from the use of additional low cost biomass fuel  a per unit decrease in natural gas cost  and a per unit decrease in fuel oil cost  partially offset by a per unit increase in the cost of electrical power purchased from third parties  a increase in occ costs and less pension income 
average wood chip costs remained level with fiscal year  while labor productivity declined a modest 
the mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year during the year  we continued to fully curtail three of our least efficient machines to match production with incoming orders 
our business process improvement initiatives to improve mill optimization  improve customer service  reduce inventories and lower our procurement costs have contributed favorably to the results 
page converted products fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease converted products sales  millions converted products operating loss  millions converted products  tons   converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume decreased while average price rose modestly 
this reduction in volume was primarily the result of the continued general slowdown in the domestic economy 
fiscal year converted products operating loss was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year operating results for fiscal year were negatively affected by allocated operating losses from the sale of electrical power of million  compared with no electrical power sales in fiscal year the remaining decrease in operating loss from converted products operations was due mainly to improved productivity measured in production hours per ton of in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  and the decrease of in the average mill cost of paper and paperboard supplied to our converting plants  partially offset by the decrease in volume sold and less pension income 
specialty sales  such as bulk bins and four or more color products continue to be an important contributor to the converted products segment of our business  representing of converted products sales for fiscal year and fiscal year fiscal year was favorably impacted by our business process improvement initiatives to improve customer service  reduce inventories  and lower procurement costs 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results net sales 
fiscal year net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year net sales decreased as a result of a million decrease in net sales of internally generated power to third parties  a decrease in net sales in our paper and paperboard segment of million  or  and in our converted products segment of million  or  offset in part by an increase in net sales in our timber segment of million  or 
see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales for fiscal year this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of a increase in natural gas costs per unit  a increase in cost of electrical power purchased from third parties per unit  a increase in old corrugated containers occ costs and losses on third party power sales 
these cost increases were partially offset by an approximate decrease in average wood chip costs 
our cost of products sold also includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the depletion cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in net sales  costs associated with our business process improvement plan and increased health and welfare costs

selected segment results timber fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease timber net sales  millions timber operating profit  millions logs  thousands of board feet   lumber  thousands of board feet   logs  thousand board feet lumber  thousand board feet fiscal year timber net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to an increase in log volume sold and improved lumber prices  partially offset by a decrease in log prices of and a decrease in lumber volume of 
due to the relatively strong demand in the domestic log market  the company was able to temporarily increase harvest levels to improve operating results and cash flow 
the overall log price decline was in part due to a soft japanese housing market and adverse us dollar to japanese yen exchange rates 
however  as a consequence of midyear improvement in the exchange rate  export prices improved modestly in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales compared with million  or  for fiscal year this decline was a result of decreases in export log prices and less lumber sold in the export market 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reason for this improvement was an increase in log volume sold  partially offset by a decrease in average log prices

paperboard volume decreased primarily as a result of our decision not to sell into the asian market at prices that were depressed 
paperboard prices were negatively affected by increased competition in the export market and the strength of the us dollar 
paper volume and prices decreased primarily as a result of the general economic slowdown in the us market 
however  the weaker us dollar in the second half of decreased imports of kraft paper to the united states and increased export pricing and demand 
combined with machine shutdowns and consolidation of converters  both demand and product pricing for most grades improved in the fourth quarter  both domestically and for our export sales 
demand and pricing especially improved in the fourth quarter for light weight kraft paper with high occ content and tea kraft semi extensible paper for use in multiwall bags 
fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year fiscal year paper and paperboard operating loss was million  compared with an operating profit of million for fiscal year operating results were negatively affected by losses from the sale of electrical power allocated to the paper and paperboard segment 
we allocated losses of million to the segment as a result of power sales in fiscal year  compared with allocated operating profits of million in fiscal year operating results were also negatively affected by a increase in the cost of electrical power per unit  increase in natural gas costs per unit  a increase in the cost of occ and lower sales prices 
as a result of operating losses incurred early in the year  the mill operating schedule and crew levels were changed to run and staff nine of our twelve paper machines creating a more steady operation and allowing us to better manage raw material purchases 
due to the new schedule and the availability of lower cost residual wood chips  we used a lower proportion of more expensive chips produced from whole log chipping operations 
operating results were favorably impacted by an reduction in average wood chip costs and improved labor productivity 
the mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year converted products fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease converted products sales  millions converted products operating profit  millions converted products  tons   converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume decreased and average price decreased 
this deterioration was primarily the result of the general slowdown in the domestic economy 
fiscal year converted products operating loss was million  compared with an operating profit of million for fiscal year operating results were negatively affected primarily by allocated operating losses from the sale of electrical power of million for fiscal year  compared with allocated operating profits of million in fiscal year operating results were also negatively affected by volume and price declines and the increased cost of paper and paperboard supplied to us by the longview mill 
the average mill cost of paper and paperboard supplied to our converting plants increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year labor productivity improved for the year resulting from changing our operating schedules and crew levels to match customer demand 
substantial progress has been made in reducing rollstock and finished goods inventories and controllable waste 
page liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of improved management of receivables and inventories  increases in payables and less noncash pension income 
the decreases in fiscal years and were primarily due to decreases in operating profits during each of those fiscal years 
net cash used for investing was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year our capital expenditures  including timberland acquisitions  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance  were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we substantially completed a capital program to enable us to increase our domestic converted products business in an effort to reduce our reliance on selling into the competitive export paperboard market 
as a result of these substantial capital investments  we substantially reduced our capital expenditures for fiscal years and significant capital expenditures completed in fiscal year include the rebuild of paper machine  the rebuild of chemical recovery furnace and modernization of pulp mill controls 
significant capital expenditures in included the construction of our new bowling green  kentucky converting plant  purchasing of flexo folder gluers  expansion of the material handling system and other equipment upgrades at our spanish fork  utah converting plant  upgrading our amsterdam  new york converting facility by expanding the building  increasing the corrugator s capacity and purchasing a flexo folder gluer  and the completion of the replacement of the press section of a paper machine which began in we expect capital expenditures to total approximately to million for each of fiscal year and fiscal year  including expenditures for timber purchases  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance 
net cash used for financing was million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  while net cash provided by financing was million in fiscal year the change for fiscal years and primarily reflect a million and a million decrease  respectively  in borrowings resulting from reduced capital expenditures and dividends 
the change in fiscal year primarily reflects a million increase in borrowings during the fiscal year to fund capital expenditures such as the construction of our bowling green  kentucky converting plant and the purchase of founders stock for million 
during fiscal years and  we did not purchase shares of our stock 
during fiscal year  we purchased an aggregate of  shares of our stock for approximately million 
each quarter we determine the amount of our dividend based on operating results  current market conditions and debt levels 
cash dividends of per share were declared and paid in both the second and third quarters of fiscal year in the aggregate amount of million each 
the resumption of the dividend in the second fiscal quarter of was based on improved operating performance and positive economic conditions that affect our business 
however  economic recovery was slower than expected and to ensure compliance with certain debt covenants  we opted to forego the dividend for the fourth fiscal quarter cash dividends of per share were declared and paid in the first fiscal quarter of in the aggregate amount of million 
there were no additional dividends declared or paid in the remainder of fiscal year the first fiscal quarter dividend reduction from prior levels was based on fourth fiscal quarter earnings 
the suspension of the dividend for the remainder of fiscal year was due primarily to the net loss incurred in the first six months of and economic conditions that were negatively affecting our business 
during fiscal year  we declared and paid total dividends of per share  for page an aggregate amount of million 
our primary financing arrangements restrict the amount of dividends we may declare based on certain financial performance tests 
in july  we entered into two fixed to floating interest rate swaps for a total of million of the million senior subordinated notes 
the purpose of the swaps is to manage our exposure to fixed rate debt by converting a portion of our outstanding debt from a fixed to a lower variable interest rate 
the new floating rate swaps have rates of approximately 
previously the company had entered into other fixed to floating interest rate swaps which were subsequently terminated to monetize the gain incurred due to lower interest rates and changes in yield 
in the second fiscal quarter  we entered into two swaps for a total of million which were terminated in october with a gain of million 
simultaneously with the termination  we entered into two swaps totaling million  which were terminated in may for a gain of million 
in both instances  the proceeds were used to repay debt and will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the senior subordinated notes  which mature in a deferred gain of million is included in other liabilities at october  at october   our financial position for borrowed debt included long term debt of million and short term borrowings of million 
at october   we had million outstanding under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition  we had million of senior subordinated notes outstanding 
also outstanding at october   were other various senior notes totaling million  million under an unsecured and uncommitted bank line of credit  and revenue bonds of million 
our financing arrangements require us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth  short and long term borrowing ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and restrict our payment of dividends 
the company was in compliance with such covenants at october  during the fiscal year  we obtained limited waivers from the holders of certain senior notes with respect to compliance with covenants that require us to maintain a specified ratio of net income available for fixed charges to fixed charges 
subsequent to the end of the third fiscal quarter  we obtained amendments for those senior notes outstanding that had a fixed charge coverage covenant 
the amendments changed the coverage requirements and the specified ratio to match a similar covenant in our agreement governing our revolving credit facility 
the company has been and remains in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenant 
in connection with the grant of the amendments  we agreed to pay certain fees to the holders of the senior notes 
we have reduced borrowed debt to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year and million at the end of fiscal year our debt peaked at million at january  due to borrowings made in connection with substantial capital expenditures  as well as timberland acquisitions  dividends and stock repurchases in and decreased operating profits in fiscal years and compared with fiscal year we have been able to reduce borrowed debt this fiscal year by million by maintaining a lower level of capital spending on new projects and by improving operating results through the implementation of our business process improvement initiatives 
in addition  we have suspended our dividend until operating profits and cash flow return to more acceptable levels 
we expect to continue to reduce debt in fiscal year by continuing to focus on operational improvements and modest levels of capital spending 
during december  we entered into a new four year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the initial borrowings under the new revolving credit facility were used to repay and cancel our old million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and to pay transaction costs on the new revolving credit facility 
page as of october   our aggregate annual debt principal repayments are as follows principal fiscal year amount a  a includes million drawn on our million revolving credit facility that was repaid in december and replaced with a new million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in december we believe that our cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our uncommitted line of credit provide sufficient resources to fund operations and to meet our debt payment obligations and foreseeable capital expenditure requirements 
other we continually review any known environmental exposures including the cost of remediation 
at the present time  we are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality  the environmental protection agency epa has issued a final air and water quality rule referred to as the cluster rule 
we estimate that over the next to years required pollution control capital expenditures could range from million to million 
we have included these and other environmental expenditures in our capital expenditure budget discussed above 
although future pollution control expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty and could continue to escalate because of continuing changes in laws and regulations and uncertainty as to how they will be interpreted and applied  we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
as part of an industry supported effort  forestry regulations have been developed in oregon and washington to protect salmon 
these regulations restrict the harvest of timber near streams and other environmentally sensitive areas  thereby reducing the timber that can be harvested and increasing costs 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities and interest rate swaps 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings and swaps are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
we do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives  other than our entering into the interest rate swaps to obtain a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings 
see note to our financial statements included in item for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate swaps 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable page rate debt increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would increase by million based on our outstanding debt as of october  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our critical accounting policies are those that may require a higher level of judgment  estimates and complexity 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are those which deal with pension expense and income and impairment of long lived assets 
pension assumptions used in the determination of pension income  including the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation are evaluated by us  reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant impact on our financial position and results from operations 
we base our discount rate assumptions on rates of return on long term high quality bonds 
the company reduced its discount rate as of october  to from to reflect decreases in rates of return on high quality bonds which had occurred from the prior year 
the discount rate of was used in the determination of net periodic pension income for fiscal year in addition  the company reduced its discount rate as of october  to from to reflect decreases in rates of return for high quality bonds which have occurred since october  net periodic pension income for fiscal year will be based on the assumed discount rate 
our assumption regarding the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected average rates of return for current asset classes in the plan investment portfolio 
the expected rate of return for fiscal year was changed to from to reflect future expected returns for the portfolio and was used in determining net periodic pension income for the year 
the expected rate of return for fiscal year will remain at 
at the end of fiscal year  the plan assets consisted of approximately equities and other assets 
the changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return effective october  contributed substantially to the reduction in net periodic pension income for fiscal year long lived assets an impairment of a long lived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and when the carrying value is not recoverable through future operations 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets annually and when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations 
to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset group is impaired  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset and the likelihood of the outcomes 
if the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable through the future cash flows  it is considered impaired 
an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value

forward looking statements are based on the company s estimates and projections on the date they are made  and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
actual events could differ materially from those anticipated by the company due to a variety of factors  including those factors outlined in the following factors that may affect our future operating results and  among others developments in the world  national  or regional economy or involving the company s customers or competitors affecting supply of or demand for the company s products  energy or raw materials  changes in product  energy or raw material prices  delays in the implementation of cost savings initiatives or the failure to obtain expected benefits from cost savings initiatives  capital project delay  cost overruns or unforeseen maintenance on capital assets  unforeseen developments in the company s business  page adverse changes in the capital markets or interest rates affecting the cost or availability of financing  or other unforeseen events 
we do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements should circumstances or our estimates or projections change 
factors that may affect our future operating results you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report 
they are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock and other securities could decline 
cyclical industry conditions and commodity pricing have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results reflect the general cyclical pattern of the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
most of our products are commodity products and are subject to competition from other timber companies and paper and paperboard products manufacturers worldwide 
historically  prices for our products have been volatile  and we  like other participants in the forest  paper and packaging products industries  have limited influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand in the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
product supply is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
demand is affected by the state of the economy in general and a variety of other factors 
the demand for our timber is primarily affected by the level of new residential construction activity and home repair and remodeling activity 
demand for our paper and packaging products is primarily affected by the state of the global economy in general and the economies in north america and east asia in particular 
a prolonged and severe weakness in the markets for one or more of our principal products could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our cash requirements  including the payment of interest and principal on our debt 
our industries are highly competitive and subject to wide price fluctuations that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the forest  paper and packaging products industries are highly competitive globally  and no single company is dominant 
these industries have suffered  and continue to suffer  from excess capacity 
during fiscal year  our longview mill operated at of capacity 
these industries are also capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs 
our competitors include large  vertically integrated forest  paper and packaging products companies and numerous smaller companies 
larger companies that compete with us in each of our markets may be better able to withstand the adverse nature of the business cycle because they may have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past  we have seen significant competition in our export markets as our global competitors have benefited from the strength of the us dollar relative to their currencies 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition and volatility within our industry  especially during periods of reduced demand 
during fiscal  the us dollar has gradually weakened which has had a positive effect on our export business  particularly on european competition in the japanese lumber market and in turn gave the japanese buyer an advantage to purchase us wood page products 
if this trend reverses  future decreases in prices for our products would adversely affect our operating results 
these factors  coupled with our substantial leveraged position  may harm our ability to respond to competition and other market conditions 
price fluctuations in raw materials could adversely affect our ability to cost effectively obtain the materials needed to manufacture our products 
the most significant raw material used in our operations is fiber  including wood  recycled and other fiber  which during fiscal year accounted for of our costs of products produced in our paper and paperboard segment  not including shipping  warehousing and outward freight 
we obtained approximately of our wood fiber requirements at open market prices during fiscal year we also obtained almost all of our recycled fiber on the open market 
wood and recycled fiber are both subject to commodity pricing  which fluctuates on the basis of market factors over which we have no control 
in addition  the cost of fiber that we purchase in the market has at times fluctuated greatly because of economic or industry conditions  particularly the conditions in the pacific northwest  where we purchase most of our fiber 
further  our access to wood fiber could be adversely affected by consolidation of sawmills in the pacific northwest that supply wood fiber to our longview mill  mill closures due to oversupplied domestic lumber markets  as well as more stringent environmental or other regulations affecting the supply or cost of timber to those sawmills 
we may not be able to pass any future raw material cost increases through to our customers through product price increases 
increased costs of raw materials  and our inability to pass increased costs through to our customers could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our operations require substantial capital and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
our operations require substantial capital 
capital requirements for expansion  replacement and maintenance of existing facilities or equipment or to comply with existing and future changes in environmental laws and regulations may be substantial 
although we maintain our equipment with regular periodic and scheduled maintenance  we cannot be sure that key pieces of equipment will not need to be repaired or replaced or that we will not incur significant additional costs associated with environmental compliance 
the costs of repairing or replacing equipment and the associated downtime of an affected production line could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
if our future capital resources are inadequate to provide for our operating needs  capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be harmed 
we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures and liabilities 
our businesses are subject to many federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the restoration and reforestation of timberlands  harvesting timber near waterways  discharges of pollutants and emissions  and the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances or other contaminants 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business and we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  significant expenditures to remain in compliance 
we expect that the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject will become more stringent and more stringently enforced in the future 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions 
page some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners  operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination 
investigations may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated  and closures of facilities may trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities 
consequently  we cannot be sure that existing or future circumstances or developments with respect to contamination  including unanticipated discovery of contamination or discharges of hazardous substances  will not require significant expenditures by us or that internally generated funds or other sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
some environmental laws permit individuals  citizens groups and other third parties to file claims against us based upon alleged violations of laws or damages to property stemming from contamination  or upon alleged injury to persons stemming from exposure to hazardous substances used or otherwise controlled by us 
we may be required to expend significant sums to defend and or settle existing or future claims 
high energy costs could adversely affect our results of operations 
energy costs are a significant variable operating expense for us and are susceptible to rapid and substantial price increases and volatility 
although our costs for energy declined during fiscal year  they remain at relatively high levels and could rapidly increase 
should energy costs increase in future periods  we may not be able to pass all increased energy costs through to our customers 
in addition  the primary contracts pursuant to which we advantageously purchased and sold power in the past have expired and  under current terms  we have less flexibility in our ability to mitigate the costs of energy used by our facilities 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies and offshore manufacturing could result in fluctuations in the price of and the demand for our products 
while all of our revenues are earned in us dollars  a large portion of our sales are made to customers operating in markets that use currencies other than us dollars 
for the fiscal year  exports accounted for over of our total sales 
of this amount  of our total sales came from timber export sales  all to japan  and of our total sales came from export sales of paper and paperboard  primarily to hong kong  canada and southeast asia 
in fiscal year  the weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of these countries has helped our products be more competitive in the export market 
however  strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of these countries could make it more expensive for our customers operating in foreign markets to purchase our products  could make our products less price competitive with our foreign competitors  and could consequently reduce the demand for our products 
in addition  adverse currency valuations could make paper and paperboard from foreign competitors more price competitive in the us market 
this situation has caused  and from time to time in the future may cause  excess supply of paper and paperboard in the united states  which  in turn  would likely result in a decrease in us paper and paperboard prices 
in addition  the migration of domestic manufacturing to offshore locations  particularly to china as we have seen in fiscal  could adversely affect the pricing of and demand for our products domestically 
page our substantial debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from responding to economic  industry or competitive conditions and fund operational requirements 
we have a significant amount of debt 
at our october  fiscal year end  we had million of borrowed debt 
our substantial amount of debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt  thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the forest  paper and packaging products industries  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds  even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
natural disasters or other events may cause losses to our timber holdings or limit our ability to harvest our timber 
the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be limited by natural disasters and other events such as fire  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding  other weather conditions and other causes 
the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  as is typical in the industry  we do not maintain insurance for any loss of our standing timber from natural disasters or other causes 
in addition  fire and other natural disasters in adjacent or nearby timberlands may limit our access to  or impede our ability to harvest  our timber 
in periods of poor logging conditions  we may harvest less timber than expected  thus impacting our net sales of timber during that period 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions 
over  of our employees  or over of our workforce  are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
as a result  there is a risk of work stoppage due to strikes or walkouts 
we have collective bargaining agreements expiring at various times through calendar year  including four agreements covering approximately employees that will expire during calendar year any significant work stoppage as a result of the failure to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single complex in longview  washington 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single complex in longview  washington 
since we do not have pulp and paper production elsewhere  a material disruption at our mill could result in a material disruption of our paper making operations 
such disruptions could be caused by prolonged power failures  a breakdown of our continuous pulp digesters or recovery furnaces  page chemical spill or release  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including railroad tracks  bridges  tunnels and roads  or fires  floods  earthquakes or other disasters 
although we currently have certain business insurance and replacement value insurance  we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover the total amount of any losses caused by any of the above events 
in addition  we are not insured against any losses due to interruptions in our business due to damage to or destruction of our longview pulp and paper making complex caused by earthquakes or to major transportation infrastructure disruptions or other events that do not occur on our premises 
a disruption in our pulp and paper operations would also adversely affect our converting plants  which in fiscal year obtained approximately of their paper and paperboard requirements from our mill 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives  but we have entered into two interest rate swaps to obtain a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings 
see note to our financial statements included in item for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate swaps 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would increase by million based on our outstanding debt as of october  page
