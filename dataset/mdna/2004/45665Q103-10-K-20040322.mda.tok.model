item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to forward looking statements on page general following is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements of infinity and the financial statements of the agency business that infinity assumed from gai on january  together  these businesses comprise infinity s operations since that date 
references in this discussion to infinity include the nsa group and the assumed agency business unless the context indicates otherwise 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements  and following  the financial statements of the assumed agency business as of and for the twelve month periods ended december  and infinity was incorporated in the state of ohio in september as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of afg 
on december   afg transferred to infinity all of the outstanding common stock of the nsa group 
through a reinsurance transaction effective january   infinity acquired the assumed agency business consisting of the personal lines business written through independent agents by afg s principal property and casualty subsidiary  gai 
the assumed agency business had net earned premiums of million in consisting primarily of standard and preferred private passenger automobile insurance 
the assumed agency business is not included in infinity s historical financial statements for periods prior to the acquisition of the nsa group and the assumption of the assumed agency business have been accounted for at afg s historical carrying amounts as transfers of net assets between entities under common control in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of insurance reserves  the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments  and accruals for litigation are the areas where the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
insurance reserves insurance reserves  or unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  are management s best estimate of the ultimate amounts that will be paid for all claims that have been reported up to the date of the current accounting period but that have not yet been paid  plus an estimate of claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the company incurred but not reported  or ibnr  and the expenses to be paid to settle claims allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses  or alae and ulae 
liabilities for the costs of losses and lae for both reported and unreported claims are estimated based on historical trends adjusted for changes in loss cost trends  underwriting standards  policy provisions  product mix and other factors 
estimating dollar amounts for unpaid losses and lae is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors  which are subject to significant variation 
changes in underlying estimates or assumptions and the resulting adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of operations in the periods in which estimates change 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management analyzes the adequacy of reserves using actuarial data and analytical reserve development techniques  including projections of ultimate paid losses  to determine the ultimate amounts of reserves 
historical medical  hospitalization  material repair and replacement costs  general economic trends and the legal environment are examples of major factors taken into account in developing these estimates 
in developing ibnr reserve amounts  quarterly estimates are made of ultimate frequency  or number of claims per earned car year  and severity  or claim cost per earned car year 
frequency can be affected by factors such as driving patterns  gas prices  changes in classes of insured drivers  and weather events 
factors affecting the severity trend include medical cost and product repair cost trends  and litigation expense patterns 
management believes that infinity s relatively low average policy limit and concentration on the nonstandard auto driver classification help stabilize fluctuations in frequency and severity 
an increase in either frequency or severity of for the current accident year would decrease earnings per share by 
other than temporary losses on investments changes in the market values of investment securities are usually recorded as changes in unrealized gains or losses on investments  a component of shareholders equity 
net earnings are not affected until the disposition of a given security or  if an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded as a realized capital loss and the cost basis of the security is reduced 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include whether the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  the extent to which market value is less than cost basis  historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer sec filings  issuer news releases  near term prospects for improvement in the issuer and or its industry  industry research and communications with industry specialists  third party research and credit rating reports  internally generated financial models and forecasts  discussions with issuer management  and ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
infinity recorded pretax impairment charges on securities as follows in thousands twelve months ended december  fixed maturities equities total 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following chart summarizes infinity s security positions with unrealized losses which were less than twelve months old and greater than twelve months old as of december  in thousands less than twelve months number of amortized market unrealized securities cost value loss fixed maturities equity securities total greater than twelve months number of amortized market unrealized securities cost value loss fixed maturities equity securities total management regularly evaluates for potential impairment each security position that i has a market value of less than of its book value or ii exceeds  as well as each position held for which one or more impairment charges have been recorded in the past 
the process of evaluation includes assessments of each bullet point listed above 
for the unrealized loss positions in the chart  the majority of the evidence that management gathered and considered indicated near term recovery  resulting in conclusions that these particular unrealized losses were more likely of a temporary nature 
should the preponderance of evidence turn negative for one or all of these positions in the future  impairment charges would likely be recorded 
since it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become other than temporarily impaired  total impairment charges could be material to the results of operations in a future period 
management believes that it is not likely  however  that such impairment charges will have a significant effect on infinity s liquidity 
accruals for litigation infinity continually evaluates potential liabilities and reserves for litigation using the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under this guidance  reserves for loss may only be recorded if the likelihood of occurrence is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
management considers each legal action using this guidance and records reserves for losses as appropriate 
infinity believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate potential liability for litigation are appropriate 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of these claims or lawsuits  management does not expect them to have a material effect on infinity s financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources ratios the naic s model law for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december   the capital ratios of all infinity insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
sources of funds infinity is organized as a holding company with all of its operations being conducted by its insurance subsidiaries 
accordingly  infinity will have continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends  and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations will come primarily from dividends and distributions from the insurance subsidiaries 
infinity plans to file a consolidated federal income tax return including all owned us subsidiaries for periods after the initial public offering 
infinity has executed a tax allocation agreement with its eligible subsidiaries under which each subsidiary agrees to pay infinity taxes computed on a separate company taxable income basis 
infinity agrees to pay each subsidiary for the tax benefit  if any  of net losses used by other members of the consolidated group 
the resulting provision or credit will be currently payable to or from the parent company  infinity property and casualty corporation 
in july  infinity secured a million  seven year amortizing term loan and added a revolving credit line of million in the fourth quarter of proceeds of million were contributed to infinity s insurance subsidiaries to support future growth of their business and reduce their reliance on reinsurance 
the remaining proceeds were used to repay a million promissory note issued in connection with infinity s initial public offering and for general corporate purposes 
the term loan was collateralized by the assets of infinity including a pledge of stock of infinity s insurance subsidiaries and contained various covenants that require infinity to meet certain minimum net worth and financial ratio standards 
principal payments of million were made in and a required supplemental payment of million was made in january from the proceeds of the overallotment share issuance in connection with the secondary stock offering 
in february infinity issued million of senior notes due  bearing a fixed interest rate 
interest payments due in are million 
the proceeds of this offering were used to prepay in full the principal balance of the term loan 
refer to footnote of the consolidated financial statements for more information on this transaction 
infinity s insurance subsidiaries generate liquidity primarily by collecting and investing premiums in advance of paying claims 
infinity had positive cash flow from operations of approximately million in  million in  and million in as of december   infinity property and casualty corporation had million of cash and investments  of which million was owed to its subsidiaries 
in  infinity s operating subsidiaries paid infinity million in ordinary dividends 
in  they may pay to infinity up to million in ordinary dividends without prior regulatory approval 
management believes that infinity s cash and investment balances and cash flows generated from operations  including dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries  are adequate to meet its future liquidity needs 
quota share agreement infinity utilizes the reinsurance market to manage its capital and surplus levels relative to its reserve liabilities  supporting its capacity for growth as well as manage its risk 
throughout  infinity s insurance subsidiaries ceded of their personal auto physical damage business on a funds withheld basis to inter ocean 
infinity renewed this agreement for on terms substantially equivalent to those in effect in except that infinity added the flexibility to elect  on a quarterly basis  the percentage of business to be ceded under the reinsurance agreement 
the allowable range was between and 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued because infinity obtained the million term loan facility  the amount of premiums ceded under this agreement was reduced from to for the third and fourth quarters of premiums ceded under this agreement for the twelve month periods ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
in september  the inter ocean agreement was amended to include coverage of gai s personal lines that infinity would otherwise assume as part of the assumed agency business 
accordingly  gai s participation in the inter ocean reinsurance agreement reduces the size of the assumed agency business 
premiums ceded by gai under this agreement were million and million for the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively 
effective january   infinity entered into a new reinsurance agreement with american re under essentially the same terms as the inter ocean agreement except the minimum amount of physical damage premiums permitted to be ceded is and the agreement does not cover the assumed agency business 
infinity is ceding of physical damage premiums for the first quarter of investments infinity s investment portfolio at december   contained  million in fixed maturity securities and million in equity securities  all carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholder s equity on an after tax basis 
at december   infinity had pretax net unrealized gains of million on fixed maturities and million on equity securities 
approximately of the fixed maturities that infinity held were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies at december  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
management believes that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return 
investments in mortgage backed securities mbss represented approximately one fifth of infinity s fixed maturities at december  mbss are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates 
when these prepayments occur faster than planned  market rates are usually lower for new investments than those that were prepaid 
for both twelve month periods ended december  and  prepayments on mbss were approximately million 
approximately of infinity s mbss are rated aaa and all are investment grade 
individual portfolio securities are sold creating gains or losses as market opportunities exist 
since all of these securities are carried at market value on the balance sheet  there is virtually no effect on liquidity or financial condition upon the sale and ultimate realization of unrealized gains and losses 
the average duration of infinity s fixed maturity portfolio was years at december  summarized information for securities with unrealized gains and losses in infinity s balance sheet at december  is shown in the following table dollars in millions 
approximately million of fixed maturities and million of equity securities had no unrealized gains or losses at december  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued summarized information for infinity s investment portfolio follows in millions gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized market december  cost gains losses value of total fixed maturities common stocks total gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized market december  cost gains losses value of total fixed maturities common stocks total december  december  number of positions held with unrealized gains losses number of positions held that individually exceed unrealized gains of  losses of  percentage of positions held with unrealized gains that were investment grade losses that were investment grade infinity s investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of million at december  there was no single industry segment concentration that accounted for more than million of these losses at that date 
at december   infinity s investment portfolio included million of gross unrealized losses  million of these losses were in securities issued by companies in the airline industry and million was in securities issued by an electric service industry firm 
no other industry segment accounted for more than million of unrealized losses at december  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the table below sets forth the scheduled maturities of fixed maturity securities at december  based on their market values in millions 
securities that do not have a single maturity date are reported at average maturity 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers 
securities securities securities with with with no unrealized unrealized unrealized all fixed maturity gains losses gains or losses maturities one year or less after one year through five years after five years through ten years after ten years mortgage backed securities contractual obligations infinity s contractual obligations as of december  are in thousands long term operating due in debt a leases total b and after total a includes an additional payment of  made on january   pertaining to the transaction described in note in february  this loan arrangement was replaced with a term loan  with the following payment commitment schedule million million million and after million total million b not included are total reserves for losses for known and unknown claims  which totaled million at december  it is not possible to reliably predict the timing of payment for these liabilities 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued exposure to market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
infinity s exposures to market risk relate primarily to its investment portfolio which is exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  equity price risk 
fixed maturity portfolio the fair value of infinity s fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
infinity s fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
this practice allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of infinity s insurance companies are managed with an attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
the following table provides information about infinity s fixed maturity investments at december  and  which are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the table shows expected principal cash flows in millions and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and collectively for all years thereafter 
callable bonds and notes are included based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield 
mbss and sinking fund issues are included based on maturity year adjusted for expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows may differ from those expected 
principal cash flows december  principal cash flows december  thereafter thereafter total  total fair value  fair value equity price risk equity price risk is the potential economic loss from adverse changes in equity security prices 
although infinity s investment in equity securities is only of total investments  it is concentrated in a relatively limited number of positions  approximately half of the total is in three investments  two of these three are electric utilities 
while this approach allows management to more closely monitor the companies and industries in which they operate  it does increase risk exposure to adverse price declines in a major position 
results of operations underwriting infinity s insurance subsidiaries sell nonstandard  standard and preferred personal auto insurance and  to a lesser extent  nonstandard commercial auto coverage and a complement of other personal lines insurance products 
nonstandard coverage is a product designed for drivers who  due to their driving record  age or vehicle type  represent higher than normal risks and pay higher rates for comparable coverage 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio  which is the sum of the ratios of losses  lae and underwriting expenses to earned premiums 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  other income or federal income taxes 
while losses on claims reported are generally determinable  the process of determining overall loss and lae reserves is also highly dependent upon the use of estimates in the case of losses incurred or expected but not yet reported or developed 
actuarial procedures and projections are used to obtain best estimates which are then included in the overall results 
these estimates are subject to changes in claim amounts and frequency and are periodically reviewed and adjusted  as additional information becomes known 
in accordance with industry practices  such adjustments are reflected in current year underwriting results 
as a result  the ratio of loss and lae expenses component of the combined ratio includes development of prior year reserves in addition to provision for losses and lae occurring in the current year 
underwriting expenses include expenses that vary directly with premium volume commissions and premium taxes as well as expenses that are relatively fixed administrative expenses 
accordingly  underwriting expenses tend to move in the same direction as premiums but at a slower rate 
as a result  the underwriting expense ratio tends to decrease when premiums grow and increase when premiums decline 
since early  infinity s insurance subsidiaries have been increasing their premium rates with a goal of achieving underwriting profits  even if it entails foregoing volume 
as with all property and casualty companies  the beneficial impact of these price increases is reflected in infinity s financial results over time 
infinity implements price increases on its in force policies as they are renewed  which generally takes between six and twelve months for the entire book of business 
infinity recognizes increased premiums on particular policies as the premiums are earned  generally over the course of the six to twelve months after the policy is effective 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net earned premiums and combined ratios for infinity and the assumed agency business were in millions net earned premiums gaap nsa group gross written premiums ceded reinsurance net written premiums change in unearned premiums net earned premiums assumed agency business net written premiums gross of the inter ocean agreement ceded premiums under the inter ocean agreement net written premiums net of the inter ocean agreement change in unearned premiums net earned premiums combined ratios gaap nsa group loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio assumed agency business loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio weighted average of infinity and agency loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio combined ratio gross of inter ocean agreement compared to the nsa group s net earned premiums fell million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  primarily as a result of actions taken to discontinue writing inadequately priced business in certain focus states 
earned premiums excluding the effect of the inter ocean reinsurance agreement declined to million  due primarily to a reduction in business volume partially offset by rate increases 
the loss and lae ratio improved by points for the twelve month period ended december  from the same period in excluding the effects of the inter ocean reinsurance agreement  the loss and lae ratio improved points 
the expense ratio improved by points in compared to primarily as a result of savings from consolidation efforts taken 
excluding the effect of the inter ocean agreement  the expense ratio improved points from in the twelve month period ended december  to in the same period in 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the assumed agency business s net earned premiums decreased million  or  for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  primarily as a result of a reduction in business volume 
earned premiums excluding the effect of the inter ocean reinsurance agreement declined million  or a reduction of  due primarily to a reduction in business volume partially offset by rate increases 
the loss and lae ratios for the assumed agency business improved from during the twelve month period ended december  to as a result of increases in rates  lower frequency of claims per auto insured and moderate increases in the average cost per claim as well as a reduction in business in the non focus states 
excluding the effects of the inter ocean reinsurance agreement  the loss and lae ratio improved from to 
the expense ratio increased points from for the twelve month period ended december  to for the same period in excluding the effects of the inter ocean reinsurance agreement  the expense ratio increased by points from for the twelve months of to for this increase was attributable to a charge of million from an increase in the rate of amortization of deferred acquisition costs following a periodic review of the deferability of specific acquisition costs 
excluding this charge  the expense ratio fell points for the twelve month period ended december  from the same period in compared to infinity s net earned premiums decreased million during due primarily to the inter ocean reinsurance agreement  effective april   under which infinity ceded of the personal automobile physical damage business written by its insurance subsidiaries during excluding the effect of this agreement  net earned premiums declined approximately  reflecting lower business volume partially offset by the impact of rate increases 
policies in force declined from approximately  on december  to  on december  the decline in policy counts was due to rate increases and actions taken to reduce business in certain non focus or non profitable states as well as decisions by insureds not to renew 
during  infinity increased personal auto rates about over rates in effect at year end underwriting expenses in included the effect of million in ceding commissions earned under the inter ocean reinsurance agreement 
commissions earned under this agreement generally vary directly with the loss and lae ratio on the business ceded 
accordingly  infinity s expense ratio reflected the benefit of strong underwriting results in the business ceded to inter ocean 
overall  infinity s combined ratio improved points over due primarily to recent rate increases 
excluding the effect of the inter ocean agreement  infinity s combined ratio for was compared to in net earned premiums of the assumed agency business decreased million in reflecting the impact of the inter ocean reinsurance agreement  effective january   under which of gai s personal automobile physical damage business written through independent agents was ceded 
excluding the effect of this agreement  net earned premiums increased million reflecting rate increases implemented in the later part of  partially offset by a reduction in volume from certain unprofitable business 
the combined ratio was flat as an increase in prior year development was offset by the shift away from underperforming business and the increase in rates over the past year 
underwriting expenses fell million in compared to reflecting gai s million ceding commission earned on premiums ceded under the inter ocean reinsurance agreement 
the remaining discussion of results of operations relates to infinity s consolidated statement of operations 
investment income changes in investment income reflect fluctuations in market rates and changes in average invested assets 
fluctuations in average invested assets reflect primarily the timing of dividends and capital contributions as capital requirements and the cash needs of infinity change 
the assumed agency business represents a portion of gai s personal lines business and is not a separate legal entity  accordingly  it does not have a separate investment portfolio and related investment income 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to net investment income decreased million for the twelve month period ended december  versus the comparable period due to lower yields available for newly invested funds  and to a lesser extent due to a reallocation to tax advantaged securities  partially offset by an increase in average invested assets of 
average invested assets increased as a result of the transfer at january  of million of securities and cash in conjunction with infinity s assumption of insurance liabilities of the assumed agency business  as well as proceeds received in july from the term loan 
compared to net investment income decreased million in compared to due primarily to i a million increase in interest expense included in net investment income on funds held from the aforementioned automobile reinsurance agreement ii a decrease in interest rates and iii an decrease in average invested assets 
average invested assets decreased due primarily to dividends paid in the fourth quarter of and the last three quarters of realized gains losses on investments compared to infinity recorded impairments for unrealized losses deemed other than temporary and realized gains on sales and disposals as follows before tax  in thousands twelve months ended december  impairments total on realized realized securities gains gains held on sales losses fixed maturities equities total compared to realized gains losses on investments include provisions for other than temporary impairment of securities still held of million in and million in increased impairment charges in recent years reflect  among other things  a rise in corporate defaults in the marketplace 
infinity owned warrants to buy the common stock of a publicly traded company in under generally accepted accounting principles  these investments are considered derivatives and marked to market resulting in realized gains and losses 
realized gains losses on investments include a loss of  in to adjust the carrying value of these warrants to their market value of  at december  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income other income increased million for the twelve month period ended december  from the corresponding period  primarily due to a nonrecurring gain of million on the commutation of service and indemnity agreements with afg and increased finance and service charge income 
interest expense interest expense was accrued at a fixed rate of on the million note due to afg until its repayment in mid july  using a portion of the proceeds of the million term loan 
the term loan accrued interest at a variable rate  which averaged from the date of issue through december  the risk of variability in future interest expense was partially hedged by the interest rate swap 
refer to footnote of the consolidated financial statements for more information on this instrument 
for the twelve month period ended december   interest expense was in thousands million note due to afg million term loan interest rate swap total other operating and general expenses compared to corporate general and administrative expenses include costs associated with the new parent company beginning in february other expenses fell million for the twelve month period ended december  from the same period in due primarily to a million litigation settlement in compared to other operating and general expenses for include goodwill amortization of million
