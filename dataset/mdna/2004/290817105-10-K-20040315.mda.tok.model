item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction embrex is an international biotechnology company engaged in the development of innovative in ovo solutions that meet the needs of the global poultry industry 
the company derives most of its global revenues from fees for the number of eggs processed by the inovoject system 
other revenue sources for the company come from lease fees related to the egg remover system and vaccine saver option 
in addition to these sources  the company may sell each of these devices to distributors under special circumstances in selected countries and to human flu vaccine manufacturers 
revenues from these sources are categorized as device revenues in the company s financial statements 
another source of revenues for the company is product sales  which currently consists of sale of an in ovo vaccine for infectious bursal disease 
the company also derives some revenues from contract r d  grant sources and other minor products 
the company s cost of revenue are primarily attributable to the costs of supporting the company s devices at customer locations around the world 
these costs include the labor  travel and parts necessary to ensure proper operation and maintenance of embrex s devices located at hatcheries of the company s customers  as well as associated depreciation  sales and property tax expenses

device revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in  representing increases of from to  and from to the revenue increase derives mainly from increased device fees  which is primarily due to an increase in the inovoject system customer base  as well as new egg remover installations 
other revenues decreased from million in to million in the other revenues were derived from miscellaneous revenues for minor products  refunds and miscellaneous grants 
the other revenues were primarily derived from funding provided by cobb vantress in support of the gender sort project  federal advanced technology program atp funds supporting the company s collaborative development project with origen therapeutics  inc and small business innovation research funding for device development work 
the decrease from to is primarily due to grant funding from cobb vantress in support of the gender sort project that occurred in that did not recur in  as well as the withdrawal of the atp grant 
during  the us dollar weakened against selected currencies compared to the same period during if average exchange rates during had remained the same as the average exchange rates for these currencies during  then the company s revenues would have increased approximately million rather than the actual increase of million 
the revenues include device lease fees derived from multi year contracts and paid trials in the united states and foreign countries  and the sale of inovoject and egg remover systems to distributors and human flu vaccine manufacturers 
the sale of inovoject systems and egg remover systems to distributors and human flu vaccine companies may cause variability in revenue and gross profit on an annual and quarterly basis 
embrex estimates that as of december   it was vaccinating in excess of of the estimated nine billion broiler birds grown in the united states and canada in given its market penetration  the company expects only minor inovoject systems revenue and earnings growth in this market  most of which is anticipated to come from new egg remover installations 
in addition  the introduction of competitor machines could affect growth and or the maintenance of the company s revenues 
sales of bursaplex  the company s proprietary vaccine for the treatment of avian infectious bursal disease  was the source of million of product revenues in as compared to million of product revenues in and million of product revenues in  representing revenue decreases of for over and a decrease for over overall bursaplex sales decreased during primarily due to lower sales caused by the company s japanese distributor s excess inventory  a weak market in latin america and a weak market in asia caused primarily by lower poultry production in korea resulting from an oversupply of poultry and poor economic conditions at the end of the company anticipates that conditions in the asian market in will continue to be challenging as the current avian influenza outbreak may impact poultry production levels as consumption in  and exports from  the region are reduced  which may result in decreased injection activity 
embrex will continue to monitor developments and intends to take appropriate steps as necessary 
management anticipates minor revenue and earnings growth in from existing inovoject system operations in the united states and canada  higher revenue and earnings growth from new inovoject system leases in other countries  and sales of bursaplex and newplex products to poultry producers worldwide 
however  the rate at which the marketplace will accept the inovoject system technology outside the united states and canada  the 
table of contents degree of acceptance of our competitor s machines within the united states and elsewhere  the timing of regulatory approvals of third party vaccines for in ovo use outside the united states and canada  costs associated with market expansion  possible variability in united states hatchery bird production as a result of grain price fluctuations  and variability in the demand for  and pricing of  us poultry and poultry products both inside and outside the united states  will impact the pace of revenue growth  if any  and sustained profitability from the installation and operational throughputs of inovoject systems 
in addition  avian disease outbreaks in markets where embrex has device placements and sales also may affect future revenues 
cost of revenue cost of revenue was of total revenues in as compared to and of total revenues in and  respectively 
year end gross margin decreased from in to in this is partially due to additional costs related to servicing the company s devices  along with the reduction in other revenues  primarily due to the suspension and withdrawal of atp funding during operating expenses vs

the company continues to manage its research and development effort to leverage its know how  patent position  market presence and expenditures 

table of contents the company s overall research and development expenses reflect expenditures incurred in three distinct departments the first of these  r d  is responsible for expenditures associated with the work on our product portfolio and in particular the newplex vaccine  inovocox  the in ovo coccidiosis vaccine  and  prior to its termination  the collaboration with origen therapeutics 
operating expenses for r d in were million  compared to expenses of million 
this decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to lower contract r d expenses  which partially resulted from a change in the inovocox team s focus from pure research to the design and building of the embrex poultry health facility 
the second of these  global product development supply gpds  is responsible for development and testing of commercial machine devices and supply of biological products 
this group is currently responsible for development and commercial testing related to the gender sort project and overseeing construction of the embrex poultry health manufacturing facility for the production of inovocox 
gpds operating expenses for and were million and million  respectively 
the increase from to is primarily due to purchasing the gender sort system from advanced automation  inc and the subsequent write down of the system as an r d expense  totaling million 
additionally  increased staff related expenses occurred as a result of a realignment of the gender sort team from engineering and manufacturing to gpds contributed in the expense increase year over year 
the third is engineering and manufacturing  which makes design modifications and improvements to the inovoject and egg remover systems and the vaccine saver option  as well as final assembly and testing prior to installation of a company device at a customer s hatchery 
operating expenses for engineering and manufacturing decreased from million in to million in this is due to realignment of contract r d expenses and engineering personnel to the gender sort project 
other income and expense interest income totaled   and  in years  and  respectively

interest costs of  related to the term loan for construction of the embrex poultry health biological facility are not reflected in the interest expense totals as this amount is being capitalized as part of the construction cost of the facility 
management expects to continue to rely principally on the use of internally generated funds to finance the cost of additional devices in  as was the case in

the net income statement effect of this million increase from resulted in a lower full year tax rate and the incurred income tax expense 
income from the fort dodge settlement was offset by net operating loss carry forwards in embrex europe  ltd 
as a jurisdiction analysis indicated that the settlement should be recorded by the company s european subsidiary 
therefore no tax provision was recorded for the million settlement net of legal expenses

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are material to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts to date  the company has not experienced any material trade accounts receivable collection issues 
however  based on a review of cumulative balances  industry experience and the current economic environment  the company currently reserves from to of trade accounts receivable  depending on the credit terms in various markets  as an allowance for uncollectible accounts

based on the sale and lease of devices and sale of products  the company has established a reserve for future claims 
the reserve is based on the estimated damages that a customer would experience if an inovoject system or batch of bursaplex should fail to perform to product specifications 
the consolidated balance reserved for warranties as of december  was million 
inventory obsolescence to date  the company has not experienced any material inventory obsolescence 
however  based on a percentage of the current product and device parts inventory levels  the company has established a reserve against future device 
table of contents parts obsolescence due to technological improvements and limited shelf life of product inventories 
the percentage used to calculate the reserve is based on a historical percentage rate adjusted for anticipated technological advances on devices and shelf life of existing biological product inventories 
the consolidated balance reserved for product and parts obsolescence as of december  was million 
deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets based upon amounts that are likely to be realized 
based on the company s recent profitability and belief that will result in an overall profit  the company has recorded deferred tax assets of million

the reserve covers expected short term claims and is based on historical data adjusted for major events and anticipated changes in headcount or participation 
the net balance reserved for the self insured employee health plan as of december  was million 
effect of inflation management expects cost of product sales and device revenues  operating expenses and capital equipment costs to change in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels 
while management generally believes that the company will be able to offset the effect of price level changes by adjusting selling lease prices and effecting operating efficiencies  any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse affect on its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents balances totaled million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase from to reflects the cash received from financing the building of the embrex poultry health facility and a favorable currency translation adjustment  offset by a million decrease in cash provided by operations and an million increase in cash used for investing in capital expenditures

for investing activities  the embrex poultry health facility used million  and device purchases and other capital expenditures required million 
these were partially offset by the million net effect of million of investments in patents and goodwill  and the million of cash received from the repayment of the advance automation loan 
see part  item  products under development gender sorting device for more information regarding this loan 
financing activities provided million primarily due to the drawdown of million from the company s bank  branch banking and trust company bb t  under the construction term loan described below and borrowings of million under the company s credit facility with bb t described below 
the issuance of common stock for million was offset by common stock repurchases of million described below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is in changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately  and of embrex s revenues for the years ended   and  respectively  were derived from our operations outside the united states 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
during  the british pound and selected latin american currencies strengthened against the us dollar compared to the same period during if average exchange rates during had remained the same as the average exchange rates for these currencies during the same period of  then the company s revenues would have been million instead of million representing a year to year growth rate of as compared to the actual exchange adjusted growth rate of 
accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component reduction of shareholders equity were million at december  as compared with million at december  this million change was mainly attributable to the weakening us dollar with respect to most of the currencies in which the company has an exchange rate risk 
since embrex europe is embrex s largest subsidiary  the exchange rate change between the us dollar and british pound and the british pound and the euro were the primary contributors to the million change in currency translation adjustments 
to date  the company has not utilized any derivative financial instruments or other hedging instruments to affect this exposure
