the automotive supply industry in which the company competes is cyclical and is influenced by the level of north american and western european vehicle production 
the company s sales results are influenced heavily by the volume of oem production of light vehicles builds in the markets it serves 
us retail automotive sales were down in versus and down in versus industry wide north american free trade agreement nafta builds were down in versus and up in versus within nafta  the builds of the big oem s were down in versus  and up in versus in western europe  builds were down nearly in versus and down in versus in south america  builds were down in versus and down in versus our relationships with our customers 
collins aikman does business with all of the world s largest vehicle manufacturers including ford  general motors  daimlerchrysler  toyota  honda  nissan  volkswagen  renault and porsche 
these relationships have typically developed over a period of many years  and have  in many cases  been enhanced by the company s recent acquisitions  which has provided the company with a resulting global footprint and capacity to supply a full range of interior products 
in each case  there is a complex mutual dependency and cooperation between the company and its customers necessary to ensure that vehicle programs are successful in key areas of quality  timing and cost 
at the same time  customer expectations are evolving  as vehicle manufacturers continue to outsource more design and integration responsibilities to the company and other tier suppliers 
as a result  customer satisfaction  especially at critical inflexion points such as new vehicle launches and vehicle refreshes  has become more complicated and places significant demands on the company s resources 
also  there is an inherent tension between the company and its customers resulting from intense competition and pricing pressures within the industry 
for example  oem customers in the automotive industry attempted to impose price decreases and givebacks throughout such attempted price decreases were generally in the to range 
several reductions have been agreed to  and others are currently being negotiated with oems and pressures may increase if overall economic and industry conditions do not improve 
finally  on some vehicle programs involving component integration at the tier level  the company is either a supplier to  or a customer of  some of its largest tier competitors  such as delphi  visteon and lear 
these types of arrangements are becoming more common within the industry  and add a new level of complexity to customer relationships  including the relationship with the vehicle manufacturer as the ultimate customer 
our ability to secure profitable new business 
the company actively pursues new business opportunities with its traditional customer base as well as with potential new customers 
the company seeks to distinguish itself on a variety of factors  including its global footprint  its capacity to supply a full range of interior products and its full service capabilities such as design  engineering  manufacturing and quality services 
there is intense competition and pricing pressure on all of these opportunities 
price is typically achieved through direct negotiations with the customer  but in certain instances customers have utilized auctions or relied on benchmarking data that have included reputed world class suppliers in emerging markets 
at the same time  the company seeks to manage its cost structure through a variety of strategies  such as vertical integration initiatives that provide greater cost control opportunities 
for example  since the company is a major purchaser of raw materials like resins  it can arrange favorable supply contracts and benefit broadly from material science developments and product simplification 
additionally  the company believes that it has the world s largest fleet of injection molding equipment for automotive products  which provides a unique ability to benefit from process improvements and best practices with respect to its plastics products on a global basis 
our ability to successfully realize the benefits of our restructuring and integration initiatives 
the company has undertaken a series of restructuring and integration initiatives to rationalize first its global manufacturing footprint and more recently its salaried workforce  including home office headcount 
these activities are expected to have the following primary benefits first  the company has closed about subscale plants and other facilities such as warehouses and consolidated activity into world class operations  which will result in a significant densification of production and resulting gains in fixed cost absorption and operating efficiencies 
second  the company is beginning to win more bundled awards with a full range of slush molded  injection molded and carpet  acoustics and fabric components on new vehicle programs 
and third  the company s salaried workforce will shrink by more than from the legacy levels  while effectiveness and customer service levels will improve due to consolidation  standardization and level loading of support infrastructure 
the impact of raw materials and energy costs 
the company is a significant consumer of resin and nylon feedstocks  which presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the company 
the challenge results from the company s sensitivity to price movements in these raw materials such as those related to recent short run spikes in the oil market  while the opportunity arises from the company s ability to leverage its buying power as  in management s opinion  the largest single automotive grade resin buyer in the world 
the company has largely been able to avoid these pricing pressures due to its ability to negotiate with a variety of global suppliers  and to shift volume from one supplier to another 
however  it is possible that the company may begin to see increased cost pressure if the spikes in the oil market continue 
the company s customers have historically been reluctant to provide pricing relief based on this type of raw material cost increases  as recently demonstrated in the handling of the recent near tripling of global steel prices 
our liquidity and capital resources 
the company is highly leveraged  due primarily to financing associated with recent acquisitions 
another contributing factor has been that most new business awards in the automotive industry require that suppliers advance certain costs relating to tooling and engineering and design services  which in some cases are incurred years before vehicle launch and are reimbursed over many years following vehicle launch as part of the piece price 
in february  the company obtained amendments to its credit facilities that significantly loosened the principal financial covenants 
the company also obtained an additional revolving credit facility of million and a new term loan in the amount of million  the proceeds of which were used to pre fund debt amortization requirements 
as a result  the company has greatly improved its financial flexibility and liquidity and has no significant amortization requirements until june impact of acquisitions 
our results for the periods discussed have been impacted by several key acquisitions  which  together with related financing transactions  have substantially increased revenues and cash flow and materially altered the company s capital and operating structure 
for example  in  the company completed three key acquisitions the acquisition of becker group llc  a leading supplier of plastic components to the automotive industry  the acquisition of joan automotive fabrics  a leading supplier of body cloth to the automotive industry  and joan s affiliated yarn dyeing operation  western avenue dyers  lp  and the acquisition of textron automotive company s trim division tac trim  one of the largest suppliers of instrument panels and fully assembled cockpit modules and a major automotive plastics manufacturer of interior and exterior trim components in north america  europe and south america 
these acquisitions  together with the company s acquisition of southwest laminates  a fabric lamination business  contributed approximately  million of additional net sales in and drove the increase in net sales from the prior year 
in addition  these acquisitions were financed by varying combinations of the company s common stock and preferred stock  warrants to purchase the company s common stock  cash on hand and borrowings under a revolving credit facility  public issuances of debt  and sales of the acquired companies accounts receivable under the receivables facility 
the company also completed the following acquisitions in and the acquisition of dutton yarns yarn texturizing business  the acquisition of delphi corp 
s plastic injection molding plant and related equipment in logro o  spain  and the acquisition from textron of the remaining interest of an italian automotive joint venture 
these transactions have likewise impacted the company s financial results and capital structure  although not to the same degree as the transactions described above 
impact of integration activities and restructuring initiatives 
we have devoted considerable efforts throughout  and to properly integrate the acquired companies 
we have also implemented a series of restructuring initiatives to ensure that the resulting combined operations have the proper structure and necessary resources to perform on a profitable basis 
these initiatives were directed initially at establishing a proper  global manufacturing footprint and included combining and rationalizing the company s legacy and acquired operations in north america  europe and south america 
more recent restructuring initiatives have focused on developing an appropriate overhead structure  including strengthening and streamlining the senior management team on a worldwide basis 
as a consequence of these restructuring initiatives  the company has incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges in each of  and for severance costs  plant and office closures  equipment and lease impairments  contractual obligations and other restructuring activities  which have impacted cash flow  operating income and net income 
for a more detailed description of these charges  see footnote  results of operations 
key indicators of performance 
in evaluating our business  our management uses operating income as an important indicator of performance 
in addition management also considers ebitda to be a useful proxy for measuring the cash generated by our business  and it is commonly used in the industry to analyze operating performance  liquidity and entity valuation 
we define ebitda as operating income plus depreciation and amortization 
management believes ebitda to be a good measure of operating performance because cash generation is necessary for the company to achieve many of the critical success factors outlined above  including investment in cost reduction activities  reducing leverage and improving liquidity 
additionally  management reviews return on invested capital  working capital changes and capital expenditures as critical financial performance metrics 
management also uses certain non financial metrics of performance  including equipment utilization and efficiency  service  production and first time quality performance  set up and tool changeover time  employee turnover and absenteeism  and safety performance

net sales for the global soft trim segment decreased million to  million from included in net sales was approximately million from small acquisitions and million in exchange gains from strengthening canadian and european currencies 
the decrease primarily resulted from the reduced impacts of business volume of million  million due to plant closures and other factors  including a decrease in continuing business of existing programs of million and commercial items of million 
contributing to the reduced continuing business of existing programs was the overall decrease in automotive builds and lower cost products going into vehicles in comparison to the prior year 
gross profit gross profit for was million  down million from gross margin for was compared to in overall margins were impacted by a third and fourth quarter improvement at the problem plants identified in the first half of the remainder of the impact is discussed as follows 
the us and mexico plastics segment had a decline in gross profit which was primarily attributed to an increase in the mix of the cockpit modules that carry a lower overall margin due to high purchased component content and commercial items of million 
offsetting these decreases was million from improved material and manufacturing efficiencies 
the global soft trim segment also contributed to the decline in gross profit primarily due to the mix of components  as well as commercial items of million 
the international plastics segment s gross profit increased due to a million improvement in material and manufacturing efficiencies offset by a decrease from volume and mix and million in commercial items 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million to million compared to million in as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from for to in contributing to the cost decrease were savings realized in connection with the salaried workforce restructuring and the previously announced european restructuring programs and rationalization of selling  general and administrative functions 
offsetting these decreases were higher net engineering and design related costs for significant new program awards of million  a million increase from the prior year 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets charges during  the company undertook three restructuring programs resulting in a million charge

included in the third quarter restructuring charge was million related to the separation agreement with thomas evans  the former chairman and ceo 
the third program resulted in a restructuring charge of million and impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter 
the objective of this program was to consolidate plant operations in europe and to further de layer management in north america 
the restructuring programs resulted in the separation of over  personnel 
operating income operating income for decreased million to million compared to the decrease was primarily due to the problem plants identified in the first six months of  higher net engineering and design related costs for significant new program awards of million  the impact of sales mix of million and commercial items includes pricing and contractual arrangements of million  offset by material and manufacturing efficiencies of million 
also  contributing to the decline was a million increase in restructuring and impairment charges 
operating income at the us and mexico plastics segment declined million primarily as a result of the problem plants identified in the first six months of  higher net engineering and design related costs for significant new program awards  the impact of sales mix and commercial items includes pricing and contractual arrangements of million 
offsetting these decreases were manufacturing efficiencies of million 
included in operating income are million in restructuring and million in impairment charges compared to million in restructuring and million in impairment charges in operating loss at the international plastics segment decreased million 
the reduction was primarily a result of material and manufacturing efficiencies of million  offset by an increase in restructuring and impairment charges and the impact of sales mix of million 
included in operating income are million in restructuring and million in impairment charges compared to million of restructuring and million in impairment charges in the global soft trim operating income decreased million primarily as a result of sales mix of million and commercial items includes pricing and contractual arrangements of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an improvement in material and manufacturing efficiencies of million 
also offsetting the decrease was a reduced amount of restructuring and impairment charges from to included in operating income are million in restructuring and million in impairment charges compared to million in restructuring and million in impairment charges in interest expense  net net interest expense from debt instruments increased million to million for the increase is primarily due to higher average borrowing levels during the year 
subsidiary preferred stock requirements in connection with the tac trim acquisition on december   products issued to textron inc preferred stock with a liquidation preference of million and an estimated fair market value of million 
in june  products repurchased million of liquidation preference series a preferred stock that was initially valued at million  along with accrued dividends of million 
the difference between the initial recorded value and the initial liquidation preference is being accreted over the life of the stock using the effective interest method 
during  interest expense from subsidiary preferred stock accretion and dividend costs were million and million  respectively 
the preferred stock accretion and dividend costs were million and million  respectively 
effective april  the company will  exercise its option to convert all  shares of the series c redeemable preferred stock to series b preferred stock on an equivalent share basis 
the primary difference between the series c and series b preferred stock was that series c holders are entitled to participation in distributions of products common equity tied to the appreciation in the value of products common equity subsequent to the issuance date of the securities 
each series c preferred stock holder will receive one share of series b redeemable preferred stock on the equivalent share basis 
loss on sale of receivables in connection with the receivables sold to non recourse facilities and through factoring arrangements  a loss of million was recognized during  compared to a loss of million in the increase is due to new non recourse factoring arrangements entered into during other expense income  net in  other expense income  net primarily included million of foreign currency transaction gains offset by million of losses related to derivatives used in the company s hedging strategies and the minority interest share of gains in a consolidated subsidiary of million

change in accounting principle during  the company implemented a change in the method of accounting for holiday pay so that such pay is accrued  and expense is recognized during the period for which the actual holiday occurs 
formerly  certain of the company s businesses accrued holiday pay and recognized expense based upon an equal monthly amount within the fiscal year 
the change in method better matches holiday expense with the period that the actual holiday occurs and the pay is earned 
as the prior method allocated costs within the fiscal year  there is no effect on prior years 
there was no effect on the entire fiscal year as the change only impacted interim periods 
additionally  during  the company implemented a change in the method of accounting for crib supply inventories held at plants 
crib supply inventories include small motors  replacement parts for production equipment and other miscellaneous repair parts for building equipment and machinery 
the company implemented a perpetual crib supply inventory system and harmonized its policy to consistently account for the capitalization of crib supply inventories 
formerly  the company had different capitalization thresholds following the various acquisitions in late and  which ranged from not capitalizing any crib supply items to capitalizing only items greater than two thousand dollars 
the new accounting method better matches the cost with the period benefiting from the expenditure  as such  inventories are charged to expense as they are placed into service and begin generating revenue 
pro forma and the cumulative effect amounts relating to the change in accounting for crib inventories is not determinable as perpetual records of crib inventory were not maintained at all the plants prior to the application of the new method in the second quarter of for the plants that previously had no perpetual records  the effect of the change was million after tax or per share recorded to increase inventory and reduce cost of sales in the three months ended june  for the year ended december   the incremental effect of the adoption had an insignificant effect 
during  the company completed its implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived assets are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment

as a result of the test  the company recorded an impairment loss of million relating to the uk plastics business in the international plastics segment 
net loss attributable to common shareholders in june  million of proceeds from a million share common stock offering was used to repurchase series a preferred stock at a price of of its liquidation preference of million 
the redeemed series a preferred stock had a carrying value of million 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the difference between the million in carrying value and the million cash payment was excluded from net income and recorded directly to equity in the company s accumulated deficit account 
although this million equity charge is excluded from net income  the charge is included in the computation of earnings loss per share and is included in the net loss attributable to common shareholders 
compared to net sales net sales for increased to  million up  million from the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the acquisitions of tac trim  becker  joan and southwest laminates swl  which contributed approximately  million 
sales for increased approximately million or over pro forma sales of  million 
new programs  increased content  a higher north american build rate and the acquisition of swl drove this sales increase 
in north america the build rate increased about 
pro forma sales are based on previous filings with the securities and exchange commission and include tac trim  becker and joan for the full year 
excluding the impact of the acquisitions  net sales decreased from the decrease is due primarily to million of discontinued non automotive and low margin business and million of commercial items offset by a million increase in new business and a million strengthening of foreign currencies 
net sales for the us and mexico plastics segment increased  million to  million from excluding the impact of the tac trim and becker acquisitions totaling approximately  million  net sales for us and mexico plastics decreased 
this reduction is primarily due to shutdowns of customer assembly plants 
net sales for the international plastics segment increased to million from without the benefit of tac trim sales totaling approximately million  sales decreased 
the decrease was primarily due to customer price reductions 
net sales for the global soft trim segment increased to  million compared to excluding the acquisition of joan and swl  which contributed approximately million to net sales  sales increased 
the increase is primarily due to increased production volumes and impact from continuing business  as well as a million impact from strengthening european currencies  offset by the weaker canadian currency and commercial items 
gross profit for  gross profit increased to from in excluding the favorable impact on gross profit from the tac trim and becker acquisitions  the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the global soft trim segment 
the global soft trim segment s increase resulted from approximately million in material and manufacturing efficiencies  partially offset by million of commercial items and rebates and million of product launch and plant consolidation cost 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in the increase is due to the additional costs assumed from the acquisitions offset by million of goodwill amortization expensed in due to the elimination of duplicate efforts  reduced headcount and reduced discretionary spending  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined from in to in restructuring and impairment of long lived assets charges during  the company undertook three restructuring programs resulting in million in restructuring charges and million in related impairment charges 
the goal of the first restructuring program that resulted in a charge of million in the first quarter was to de layer management in the north american and european operations 
the objective of the second program that resulted in a million restructuring charge and million impairment charge in the third quarter was to realign the operations in north america 
included in the third quarter restructuring charge was million related to the separation agreement with thomas evans  the former chairman and ceo 
the third program resulted in a restructuring charge of million and impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter 
the objective of this program was to consolidate plant operations in europe and to further de layer management in north america 
the restructuring programs resulted in the separation of over  personnel during  the company undertook two restructuring programs resulting in charges totaling million 
the goal of the first quarter restructuring program which  resulted in a charge of million  was to de layer management in the north american and european operations 
the second program resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million 
the objective of this program was to downsize three facilities in north america via better utilization of manufacturing and warehouse floor space including associated headcount reductions and to reduce headcount in our mexican operations 
the million charge includes million of severance and other exit costs and million of asset impairment charges 
operating income operating income increased million from the majority of the increase was due to the acquisitions 
however  material and manufacturing efficiencies also contributed to the increase  partially offset by commercial items  product launch and plant consolidations costs and an increase in restructuring charges 
the us and mexico plastics segment results reflect a million improvement in operating performance 
after considering the approximate million impact of acquisitions  the us and mexico plastics business operating income remained unchanged 
negative effects on operating income included a decrease in sales volumes and resulting inefficiencies associated primarily with certain gm models  million of product launch and plant consolidation costs  million related to the decline in plastic sales due to the shutdown of customer assembly plants and commercial items 
these decreases were offset by purchasing and spending savings and reductions in administrative expenses 
the international plastics operating performance was adversely impacted by commercial items and operating inefficiencies  as well as million due to restructuring charges 
these reductions were offset by spending and purchase savings 
global soft trim operating income increased million primarily the result of million of improved material and manufacturing efficiencies  million of sales growth resulting from an increase in light vehicle build  million of reductions in administrative expense  and approximately million from the impact of the acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by million of commercial items and million of operating inefficiencies due to launch costs associated with the bmw mini program 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased million to million for the increase in interest expense is primarily attributed to higher average debt balances and increased amortization of debt issue costs resulting from the tac trim acquisition  partially offset by the benefit of working capital reductions 
subsidiary preferred stock requirements in connection with the tac trim acquisition on december   products issued to textron preferred stock with a liquidation preference of million and an estimated fair market value of million 
in june  products repurchased million of liquidation preference series a preferred stock that was initially valued at million  along with accrued dividends of million 
the difference between the initial recorded value and the initial liquidation preference will be accreted over the life of the stock using the effective interest method

the preferred stock accretion and dividend costs were million and million  respectively 
loss on sale of receivables the company has the ability to sell  through its carcorp subsidiary  interests in a pool of accounts receivable 
in connection with the receivable sales  a loss of million was recognized during  compared to a loss of million for in december  the company entered into a new larger receivable facility in connection with the tac trim acquisition  resulting in up front fees of million 
other expense income  net in  other expense income  net primarily included million of losses related to derivatives used in the company s foreign currency hedging strategy offset by million of foreign currency transaction gains  million of losses related to investments in joint ventures  million of losses from sale and leaseback transactions and the minority interest share of losses of a consolidated subsidiary of million 
in  other expense income  net primarily included a million loss on early extinguishment of debt and million of foreign currency transaction losses offset by million of derivatives gains and a million gain related to a stock demutualization 
the company adopted sfas during and reclassified million loss on the early extinguishment of debt recorded for the year ended december  to other expense income  net from an extraordinary item in the amount of million net of income taxes of million 
income taxes the company recognized an income tax expense of million for compared to an income tax benefit of million in net cash taxes paid during the period were million 
the primary reasons for the company s relatively high effective tax rate are non deductible preferred stock dividends and accretion  foreign losses for which tax benefits are not allowed and certain taxes that do not fluctuate directly with income 
discontinued operations during and  the company received payment on environmental claims related to discontinued operations  for which reserves were previously charged  and received proceeds of million and million  respectively

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the difference between the million in carrying value and the million cash payment was excluded from net income and recorded directly to equity in the company s accumulated deficit account 
although this million equity charge is excluded from net income  the charge is included in the computation of earnings loss per share and is included in the net loss attributable to common shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources the company and its subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s ability to utilize availability under its various credit arrangements and receivables facility is limited  in accordance with covenants established under the senior secured credit facility 
however  at december   there were no restrictions and the company had million in aggregate of unutilized availability 
the total availability at december  was comprised of million under the company s receivables facility  million under the company s revolving credit facility and approximately million under uncommitted bank facilities in foreign locations 
the numbers indicated above under the revolving credit facility were further reduced by outstanding letters of credit of million as of december  funding limitations are based on the company s financial performance and target levels established by the covenants 
at december   there were no funding limitations 
in october  the company entered into third and fourth amendments to the senior secured credit facilities credit agreement 
the principal changes resulting from these amendments were to permit the add back of certain restructuring charges for covenant calculation purposes  to increase the maximum permitted leverage ratio for periods beginning with the third quarter of and make adjustments to the interest coverage ratio 
previously  in the second quarter  the company executed a second amendment to the senior secured credit agreement 
the principal changes were modifications of certain covenants  including an increase in the maximum permitted leverage covenant and a decrease in the minimum interest coverage ratio 
the amendment is effective for periods following the first quarter other modifications were made to the credit agreement and are detailed in note long term debt and capital lease obligations as well as in the copy of the amendments  which are filed as an exhibit to this form k 
in february  the company entered into the fifth amendment to the senior secured credit facilities credit agreement which allowed the establishment of a new million supplemental revolving credit facility and the million tranch a term loan 
in connection with these new expanded facilities  million was used to prepay existing tranche a and tranche b term loans in direct order of maturity 
the company s principal sources of funds are cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities  receivables arrangements and sales leaseback arrangements 
in addition  to facilitate the collection of funds from operating activities  the company has sold receivables under its receivables facility and has also entered into an accelerated payment collection program with two of its larger customers 
if those additional liquidity sources were to become unavailable or limited by customer concentration or credit quality or otherwise  the company would require additional capital  access to which is not assured 
during  the company issued common stock  although such issuances are not likely to be a source of financing in the near term 
the company continues to seek means to generate additional cash for debt reduction and its growth strategy 
among its potential cash generation projects  the company seeks to further improve working capital management including factoring of receivables and to continue to utilize lease financings 
operating activities net cash provided by the continuing operating activities of the company was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily the result of increases in other asset balances  offset by increases in proceeds from non recourse factoring facilities  increases in proceeds from participating interests in accounts receivable  reductions in accrued expenses and other liabilities  decreases in inventories and other positive working capital changes 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of the company was million for  compared to net cash used of million for the increased use of cash was primarily the result of a million increase in capital expenditures

however  there can be no assurances that contingent liabilities will not arise or that known contingent liabilities or related claims will not exceed the company s expectations or that insurance will be available to cover these liabilities 
because the cash requirements of the company s operations are substantially a function of these contingencies  it is possible that actual net cash requirements could differ materially from the company s estimates

critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
considerable judgment is often involved in making these determinations  the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different results 
management believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate  however actual results could differ from those estimates

under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized

the company completed its initial impairment test in the second quarter of and recorded an impairment loss of million having no tax impact  or per average basic and diluted share relating to the uk plastics business in the former european and rest of world automotive systems segment 
the impairment loss was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and  therefore  is accounted for as if it occurred on january  the company completed its annual impairment test on november  indicating that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values 
the company s first quarter results were below the forecasts utilized in testing for the goodwill impairment for the year ended december  the conditions in the markets in which the company operates continued to deteriorate and customer production schedules continued to decline  and therefore  the company reduced its operating and financial plans for as a result  the company initiated an impairment test outside of the annual testing date of november during the second quarter during the second quarter  the company carefully reviewed all of its assumptions regarding revenue growth  improved operating margins and planned capital expenditures

the company s ability to generate future taxable income is dependent on numerous factors  including general economic conditions  the state of the automotive industry and other factors beyond management s control 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectation of future taxable income
