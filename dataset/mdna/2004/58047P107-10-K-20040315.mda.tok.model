while the majority of our investment portfolio continues to be senior debt investments  our business strategy to diversify our investments to cover the entire capital structure has resulted in an increase in subordinated debt investments and equity investments and has increased the percentage of our investment portfolio that is in majority owned and control companies 
our investment in telecomm north corp 
is part of a strategy to make more control investments with platform companies 
we intend to consolidate a number of une p clec telecommunications companies into several larger clecs  which will provide more scale to their operations  which we believe will improve profitability  leverage the overhead and network infrastructures  and provide more options with respect to capitalization alternatives

as of december  and  net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled million and million  respectively 
for additional information on the decrease in unrealized depreciation on investments  see the section entitled net investment gains and losses 
in addition to various risk management and monitoring tools  we also use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio 
we use the following to investment rating scale 
below is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating investment rating summary description capital gain expected or realized full return of principal and interest or dividend expected with customer performing in accordance with plan full return of principal and interest or dividend expected but customer requires closer monitoring some loss of interest or dividend expected but still expecting an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment expected which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment 
table of contents the following table shows the distribution of our investments on the to investment rating scale at fair value as of december  and dollars in millions investment rating investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio total the investment rating balance increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to originations and upgrades of and rated investments 
the origination of rated investments included new equity and subordinated debt in control companies and the rating upgrades included investments in the telecommunications and information services sectors 
early payoffs created most of the decrease in the rated investments 
we monitor loan concentrations in our portfolio  both on an individual loan basis and on a sector or industry basis  to manage overall portfolio performance due to specific customer issues or specific industry issues 
at december   of the investments with a rating  million were loans  all of which were on non accrual

we monitor individual customer s financial trends in order to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each customer and to evaluate overall portfolio quality 
we closely monitor the status and performance of each individual investment on a quarterly and  in some cases  a monthly or more frequent basis 
because we are a provider of long term privately negotiated investment capital to growth oriented companies and we actively manage our investments through our contract structure and corporate governance rights  we do not believe that contract exceptions such as breaches of contractual covenants or late delivery of financial statements are necessarily an indication of deterioration in the credit quality or the need to pursue remedies or an active workout of a portfolio investment 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the customer to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will  as a general matter  place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal has been paid 
however  we may make exceptions to this policy if the investment is well secured and in the process of collection 
at december  and  there were million and million  respectively  of loans  or approximately and  respectively  of the investment portfolio  greater than days past due

the non accrual and past due loans at december  and primarily represented borrowers in the publishing  telecommunications and paging businesses 
portions of the trade publishing industry which are dependent on financial  technology or telecommunications advertising  experienced sluggish advertising revenue 
certain companies in the telecommunications industry have suffered from competitive pressure from low cost and prepaid cellular calling plans

at december   of the million of loans to other affiliates  none were on non accrual status 
when principal and interest on a loan is not paid within the applicable grace period  we will contact the customer for collection 
at that time  we will make a determination as to the extent of the problem  if any 
we will then pursue a commitment for immediate payment and if we have not already  we will begin to more actively monitor the investment 
we will formulate strategies to optimize the resolution process and will begin the process of restructuring the investment to better reflect the current financial performance of the customer 
such a restructuring may involve deferring payments of principal and interest  adjusting interest rates or warrant positions  imposing additional fees  amending financial or operating covenants or converting debt to equity 
in general  in order to compensate us for any enhanced risk  we receive additional compensation from the customer in connection with a restructuring 
during the process of monitoring a loan that is out of compliance  we will in appropriate circumstances send a notice of non compliance outlining the specific defaults that have occurred and preserving our remedies  and initiate a review of the collateral 
when a restructuring is not the most appropriate course of action  we may determine to pursue remedies available under our loan documents or at law to minimize any potential losses  including initiating foreclosure and or liquidation proceedings 
prior to our conversion to a business development company  we provided an allowance for loan losses estimated to be sufficient to absorb probable future losses  net of recoveries 
from inception through november   we had provided million of allowance for loan losses  including million of allowance recorded in the asset acquisition and had charged off million

the amendment increased this ratio to for any date prior to and including june  and decreased this ratio to thereafter 
this amendment also included a waiver with respect to the applicability of the charge off ratio for periods prior to february additionally  this amendment required us to increase the amount of collateral held by the noteholders by pledging the mcg commercial loan trust class c notes  which we own 
as noted below  on february   the requirement relating to loan charge offs was eliminated 
on february   we entered into an agreement with wachovia bank  national association to amend the revolving credit facility that we had established through mcg master trust 
the amendment to the revolving credit facility  among other things  provides for the following a decrease in our borrowing capacity from million to million  which will further be reduced to million on june  and to million by september   an extension of the revolving period to september   permits recourse to mcg capital itself in the event that the interest and principal payments from the loans we transferred to mcg master trust in connection with the revolving credit facility are insufficient to repay the outstanding amount due under the revolving credit facility  eliminates a requirement relating to loan charge offs at the servicer level that we were previously required to seek a waiver from in february changes the date on which the holder of the notes issued by mcg master trust receives final payment on such notes from june to september  and reduces the interest rate payable under the revolving credit facility from the commercial paper rate plus to libor plus 
warehouse facility on january   our wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose indirect subsidiary  mcg commercial loan trust entered into a million secured warehouse credit facility with an affiliate of ubs ag 
we will use the warehouse credit facility to fund our origination and purchase of a diverse pool of loans  including broadly syndicated rated loans  that we intend to securitize using an affiliate of the lender as the exclusive structurer and underwriter or placement agent 
advances under the credit facility will bear interest at libor plus 
the warehouse credit facility operates much like a revolving credit facility that is primarily secured by the loans acquired with the advances under the credit facility 
in addition  the lender will have recourse to mcg capital corporation itself in a maximum aggregate amount of million in the event that the principal and interest payments from the loans transferred to mcg commercial loan trust are insufficient to repay the outstanding amount due to the lender 
the warehouse credit facility is cancelable by the lender for cause at any time and has an expiration term of september  outstanding borrowings our million revolving credit facility sponsored by wachovia bank  national association is scheduled to terminate on september   or sooner upon repayment of our borrowings thereunder after september  our million securitization facility is scheduled to terminate on february  or sooner upon repayment of our borrowings 
our million secured warehouse facility with an affiliate of ubs ag is scheduled to terminate on september

each of our borrowing facilities is funded through bankruptcy remote  special purpose  wholly owned subsidiaries of ours and  therefore  their assets may not be available to our creditors 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our borrowings 
dividends we have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
in order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company  we are required to i distribute at least of our investment company taxable income and of any ordinary pre ric built in gains we recognize between january  and december   less any taxes due on those gains to avoid corporate level taxes on the amount distributed to stockholders other than any built in gain recognized between january  and december  and ii distribute actually or on a deemed basis at least of our income both ordinary income and net capital gains to avoid an excise tax 
we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders of all of our income  except for certain net capital gains and adjustments for long term incentive compensation expense 
we intend to make deemed distributions to our stockholders of any retained net capital gains 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the investment company act of and due to provisions in our credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company 
we cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level 

table of contents the following table summarizes our dividends declared and paid on all shares  including restricted stock  to date date declared record date payment date amount december  december  january  august  august  october  june  june  july  march  april  april  december  december  january  september  october  october  june  june  july  march  april  april  december  january  january  total declared the aggregate dividend of per share in december consisted of a dividend of per share for the fourth quarter of and an additional dividend of per share representing the distribution of substantially all of our earnings and profits since inception through december  the aggregate dividend of declared in september consisted of a dividend of per share for the third quarter of and an additional dividend of per share which represented the remaining distribution of our earnings and profits since inception through december  the aggregate dividend declared in december along with the dividend declared in september  were required for us to qualify as a regulated investment company 
related party transactions prior to election to be regulated as a business development company  we terminated our stock option plan and adopted a restricted stock program under which we issued  shares of restricted common stock to employees and directors 
the total number of shares issued for the termination of the option plan was based upon the black scholes option pricing model and assumptions and approved by our board of directors 
see recent developments and note i to consolidated financial statements 
we made cash payments totaling million to non executive employees for the taxes imposed on them associated with the issuance of restricted common stock 
the cash payments assumed a combined federal and state tax rate of for each employee 
additionally  in connection with the termination of our stock option plan  certain executive officers and employees purchased a portion of the  shares of restricted common stock at a per share price of 
those executive officers and employees issued partially non recourse notes to us  with an aggregate face value of million secured by approximately million shares with a value of million at the initial public offering price 
the notes are payable at the end of a four and a half year term  subject to acceleration  bear interest at payable annually and are secured by all of the restricted common stock held by such employee and for some employees  for a specified time period  additional shares of our common stock the employee owns 
the notes are non recourse as to the principal amount but recourse as to the interest 
amounts due on these loans are reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income recognition interest on commercial loans is computed by methods that generally result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the customer to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will  as a general matter  place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal has been paid 
however  we may make exceptions to this policy if the investment is well secured and in the process of collection 
paid in kind interest in accordance with gaap  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual paid in kind pik interest  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term 
however  in certain cases  a customer makes principal payments on its loan prior to making payments to reduce the pik loan balances and  therefore  the pik portion of a customer s loan can increase while the total outstanding amount of the loan to that customer may stay the same or decrease 
pik loans represented million or of our portfolio of investments as of december  and million or of our portfolio of investments as of december  pik related activity for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended december  in millions beginning pik loan balance pik interest earned during the period change in interest receivable on pik loans principal payments of cash on pik loans pik loans converted to other securities realized loss ending pik loan balance as noted above  in certain cases  a customer may make principal payments on its loan that are contractually applied first to the non pik loan balance instead of the pik loan balance 
if all principal payments from these customers had been applied first to any pik loan balance outstanding at the time of the payment  and any remainder applied to the non pik loan balance  an additional million of payments would have been applied against the december  pik loan balance of million and an additional million of payments would have been applied against the december  pik loan balance of million 
as of december   of the million of pik loans outstanding have an investment rating of or better and as of december   of the million of pik loans outstanding had an investment rating of or better 
the net increase in loan balances as a result of contracted pik arrangements are separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
loan origination fees loan origination fees are deferred and amortized as adjustments to the related loan s yield over the contractual life of the loan 
in certain loan arrangements  warrants or other equity interests are received from the borrower as additional origination fees 
the borrowers granting these interests are typically non publicly traded companies 
we record the financial instruments received at fair value as determined by our board of directors 
fair values are determined using various valuation models which attempt to estimate the underlying value of the associated entity 
these models are then applied to our ownership share considering any discounts for transfer restrictions or other terms which impact the value 
changes in these values are recorded through our statement of operations 
any resulting discount on the loan from recordation of warrant and other equity instruments are accreted into income over the term of the loan 
we had million and million of unearned income as of december  and december   respectively 

table of contents unearned income activity for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended december  in millions cash received equity interest and future receivables total cash received equity interest and future receivables total beginning unearned income balance additional fees unearned income recognized unearned fees applied against loan balance a ending unearned income balance a when a loan is paid off at an amount below our cost basis  we apply any fees received that have not been recognized as income against the outstanding loan amount to reduce the cost basis  which has the effect of reducing any realized loss 
other fees in certain investment transactions  we perform investment banking and other advisory services 
for services that are separately identifiable and external evidence exists to substantiate fair value  income is recognized as earned which is generally when the investment transaction closes 
valuation of investments at december   approximately of our total assets represented investments recorded at fair value 
value  as defined in section a of act  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii for all other securities and assets  fair value is as determined in good faith by the board of directors 
since there is typically no readily available market value for the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment 
unlike banks  we are not permitted to provide a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we must determine the fair value of each individual investment on a quarterly basis 
we will record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has decreased in value  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  our investment has also appreciated in value  where appropriate 
as a business development company  we invest primarily in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of private companies 
the structure of each debt and equity security is specifically negotiated to enable us to protect our investment and maximize our returns 
we generally include many terms governing interest rate  repayment terms  prepayment penalties  financial covenants  operating covenants  ownership and corporate governance parameters  dilution parameters  liquidation preferences  voting rights  and put or call rights 
in many cases  our loan agreements also allow for increases in the spread to the base index rate if the financial or operational performance of the customer deteriorates or shows negative variances from the customer s business plan and  in some cases  allow for decreases in the spread if financial or operational performance improves or exceeds the customer s plan 
our investments are generally subject to some restrictions on resale and generally 
table of contents have no established trading market 
because of the type of investments that we make and the nature of our business  our valuation process requires an analysis of various factors 
our fair value methodology includes the examination of  among other things  the underlying investment performance  financial condition and market changing events that impact valuation 
with respect to private equity securities  each investment is valued using industry valuation benchmarks  and then the value is assigned a discount reflecting the illiquid nature of the investment  and  where appropriate  as our minority  non control position 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering  or subsequent equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private equity valuation 
securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange generally will be valued at the prevailing bid price on the valuation date 
however  restricted or thinly traded public securities may be valued at discounts from the public market value due to the restrictions on sale 
securitization transactions periodically  we transfer pools of loans to special purpose entities spes for use in securitization transactions 
these on balance sheet securitization transactions comprise a significant source of our overall funding  with the total face amount of the outstanding loans and equity investments assumed by third parties equaled million at december  and million at december  on april   the company adopted the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which applies prospectively to all securitization transactions occurring after march  adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our operations or financial position 
transfers of loans have not met the requirements of sfas no 
for sales treatment and are  therefore  treated as secured borrowings  with the transferred loans remaining in investments and the related liability recorded in borrowings 
recent developments in january of  we entered into a credit and warehouse agreement with ubs ag 
this agreement allows us to borrow up to million subject to partial recourse and other covenants and restrictions 
this facility provides financing for loans that will collateralize a potential future term securitization 
in february of  we amended our revolving credit facility  established through mcg master trust 
the amendment reduces the total availability under the facility to million  extends the facility s revolving period to september with required payments down to million by that date  adds recourse to mcg for payments  and revises certain other provisions of the agreement including reducing the interest rate and adjusting final maturity from june of to september of in the first quarter of  as part of a review of our executive compensation  the compensation committee of our board of directors agreed with certain of our executive officers to allow the forfeiture restrictions to lapse with respect to their tier i and tier ii shares immediately upon full repayment of the partially nonrecourse promissory notes that are secured by the restricted stock 
in addition  the compensation committee waived the performance based forfeiture restrictions and modified the time based forfeiture provisions associated with the tier iii shares through their respective amended and restated restricted stock agreements 
the impact of these changes on long term incentive compensation expense  assuming a market price of our common stock of and assuming that all of the executives repay their promissory notes in the first quarter of  would be an increase of up to approximately million for the first quarter of and million for the year ending december  in march of  we acquired the assets of kagan world media  a media  communications and entertainment research firm based in carmel  ca 
kagan publishes analytics in the form of newsletters and databooks and covers valuation  m a deals  revenue forecasts  cash flow  and subscriber trends in cable  broadcast  home video  motion picture  newspaper and wireless industries 
kagan sponsors conferences  provides appraisals and offers litigation support and expert testimony on valuations to the industries it serves 

table of contents risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the risks described below and all other information contained in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes and the schedules and exhibits to this annual report 
risks related to our business and financial results we have a limited operating history as a business development company and as a regulated investment company  which may impair your ability to assess our prospects 
prior to our initial public offering in december  we had not operated as a business development company under the investment company act of or as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
as a result  we have limited operating results under these regulatory frameworks that can demonstrate to you either their effect on our business or our ability to manage our business under these frameworks 
in addition  prior to our initial public offering  our management had no prior experience managing a business development company or regulated investment company 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate successfully as a business development company and a regulated investment company 
because there is generally no established market for which to value our investments  our board of directors determination of the value of our investments may differ materially from the values that a ready market or third party would attribute to these investments 
under the act  we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or  if there is no readily available market value  at fair value as determined by our board 
we are not permitted to maintain a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we are required by the act to specifically value each individual investment and to record any unrealized depreciation for any asset that we believe has decreased in value 
because there is typically no public market for the loans and equity securities of the companies in which we invest  our board will determine the fair value of these loans and equity securities pursuant to our valuation policy 
these determinations of fair value necessarily will be somewhat subjective 
accordingly  these values may differ materially from the values that would be determined by a third party or placed on the portfolio if there existed a market for our loans and equity securities 
we make loans to and invest in privately owned small and medium sized companies  which may default on their loans  thereby reducing or eliminating the return on our investments 
our portfolio primarily consists of loans to and securities issued by small and medium sized privately owned businesses 
compared to larger publicly owned firms  these companies may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  may have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs  may have a weaker financial position  and may need more capital to expand or compete 
these businesses also may experience substantial variations in operating results 
they may face intense competition  including from companies with greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
typically  they also depend for their success on the management talents and efforts of an individual or a small group of persons 
the death  disability or resignation of any of their key employees could harm their financial condition 
furthermore  some of these companies do business in regulated industries and could be affected by changes in government regulation 
accordingly  these factors could impair their cash flow or result in other events  such as bankruptcy  which could limit their ability to repay their obligations to us  and may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
deterioration in a borrower s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in any collateral for the loan 
some of these companies may be unable to obtain financing from public capital markets or from traditional credit sources  such as commercial banks 
accordingly  advances made to these types of customers may entail a higher risk of loss than advances made to customers who are able to utilize traditional credit sources 
these conditions may also make it difficult for us to obtain repayment of our loans 

table of contents furthermore  there is generally no publicly available information about such companies and we must rely on the diligence of our employees to obtain information in connection with our investment decisions 
if we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies  we may not make a fully informed investment decision and we may lose money on our investments 
if the industry sectors in which our portfolio is concentrated experience adverse economic or business conditions  our operating results may be negatively impacted 
our customer base is primarily in the communications  information services  media and technology  including software and technology enabled business services  industry sectors 
these customers can experience adverse business conditions or risks related to their industries 
see business market opportunity for a discussion of the types of businesses in each sector that we target 
accordingly  if our customers suffer as some customers currently are due to these adverse business conditions or risks or due to economic slowdowns or downturns in these industry sectors  we will be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio and our operating results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  if demand for financing by existing and new customers in these industries declines  we may not be able to increase our lending and investment volume and our operating results will be adversely affected 
economic downturns or recessions may impair our customers ability to repay our loans  harm our operating results and reduce our volume of new loans 
many of our customers may be susceptible to the economic downturns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods 
therefore  our non performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods 
economic downturns or recessions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments 
economic downturns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in net income 
unfavorable economic conditions could also lead to a decrease in revenues and assets 
an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the industry sectors in which we concentrate  causing us to be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio and experience diminished demand for capital in these industry sectors and  consequently  our operating results may be negatively impacted 
at december  and  there were million and million  respectively  of loans  or approximately and  respectively  of the investment portfolio  greater than days past due 
at december   including million of the loans greater than days past due  there were million of loans  or approximately of the investment portfolio  on non accrual status 
at december   including all million of the loans greater than days past due  there were million of loans  or approximately of the investment portfolio  on non accrual status 
the non accrual and past due loans primarily represented borrowers in the publishing  telecommunications and paging businesses 
portions of the trade publishing industry which are dependent on financial  technology or telecommunications advertising  experienced sluggish advertising revenue 
certain companies in the telecommunications industry have suffered from competitive pressure from low cost and prepaid cellular calling plans at december   of the million of loans to our majority owned companies  million were on non accrual status 
at december   of the million of loans to our majority owned companies  million were on non accrual status 
as of december   of the million of loans to controlled companies  million were on non accrual status 
at december   all million of the loans to our controlled companies were on non accrual status 
as of december   of the million of loans to other affiliates  million were on non accrual status 
at december   of the million of loans to other affiliates  none were on non accrual status 
unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs  limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us 
these events could prevent us from increasing our loan originations and investments and harm our operating results 

table of contents if we fail to qualify as a regulated investment company  we will have to pay corporate level taxes on our income and our income available for distribution would be reduced 
we elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code with the filing of our federal corporate income tax return for  which election was effective as of january  if we can meet certain requirements  including source of income  asset diversification and distribution requirements  as well as if we continue to qualify as a business development company  we will qualify to be a regulated investment company and will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders as dividends  allowing us to substantially reduce or eliminate our corporate level tax liability 
covenants and provisions in our credit facilities limit the ability of our subsidiaries and our securitization trusts to make distributions to us  which could affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to maintain our status as a regulated investment company 
in addition  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to make distributions to our shareholders because in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income 
if we fail to qualify as a regulated investment company  we will have to pay corporate level taxes on all of our income whether or not we distribute it  which would substantially reduce the amount of income available for distribution to our stockholders 
even if we qualify as a regulated investment company  we generally will be subject to a corporate level income tax on the income we do not distribute 
moreover  if we do not distribute at least of our income  we generally will be subject to a excise tax 
see regulation as a business development company and certain us federal income tax considerations taxation as a regulated investment company 
because we will distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders  we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth 
if additional capital is unavailable or not available on favorable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired 
in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to a regulated investment company  we intend to distribute to our stockholders all of our income except for certain net capital gains 
we expect to elect to make deemed distributions to our stockholders of the retained net capital gains 
in addition  as a business development company  we generally will be required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
because we will continue to need capital to grow our loan and investment portfolio  this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all  or may be restricted by the terms of our securitization facilities 
if additional funds are not available to us  we could be forced to curtail or cease our new lending and investment activities  and our net asset value could decrease 
we have substantial indebtedness and servicing our indebtedness could reduce funds available to grow our business 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our securitization facilities 
as a result  our current financial structure has a high proportion of debt and our debt service is substantial 
as of december   the weighted average annual interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was 
in order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness  we must achieve annual returns on our december  total assets of at least 
our ability to service our debt depends largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures 
in addition  our subsidiaries have sold some of our loans to trusts that serve as the vehicles for our securitization facilities  and we do not hold legal title to these assets 
however  we bear losses of principal and interest from defaults on these loans held by the trusts up to the amount of our retained interest in the trusts  which was approximately million as of december  
table of contents our securitization facilities impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities  including limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our status as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
borrowings  also known as leverage  magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and  therefore  increase the risks associated with investing in our securities 
leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique 
if the value of our consolidated assets increases  then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged 
conversely  if the value of our consolidated assets decreases  leveraging would cause net asset value attributable to our common stock to decline more than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged 
similarly  any increase in our consolidated revenue in excess of consolidated interest expense on our borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage 
any decrease in our consolidated revenue would cause net income to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock 
as a business development company  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
if this ratio declines below  we may not be able to incur additional debt and may need to sell a portion of our investments to repay some debt when it is disadvantageous to do so  and we may not be able to make distributions 
at december   this ratio was approximately 
if we are not able to refinance our debt or able to do so on favorable terms  we would not be able to operate our business in the ordinary course 
our million revolving credit facility sponsored by wachovia bank  national association is scheduled to terminate on september   or sooner upon repayment of our borrowings thereunder after september  our million securitization facility is scheduled to terminate on february  or sooner upon repayment of our borrowings 
our million secured warehouse facility with an affiliate of ubs ag is scheduled to terminate on september  we cannot assure you that we will be able to extend the terms of these facilities or obtain sufficient funds to repay any amounts outstanding under these facilities before they expire or terminate either from a replacement facility or alternative debt or equity financing 
if we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under these facilities and are declared in default or are unable to refinance these facilities  we would not be able to operate our business in the regular course 
even if we are able to refinance our debt  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms 
you may not receive distributions 
we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions 
see regulation as a business development company 
also  restrictions and provisions in our securitization facilities limit our ability to make distributions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company 
see certain us federal income tax considerations taxation as a regulated investment company 
we cannot assure you that you will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level 
we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contracted payment in kind interest  which 
table of contents represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term 
the increases in loan balances as a result of contracted payment in kind arrangements are included in income in advance of receiving cash payment  and are separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to maintain our status as a regulated investment company 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and certain us federal income tax considerations taxation as a regulated investment company 
if we fail to manage our growth  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since purchasing our business from first union national bank in our growth has placed and could continue to place significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we must continue to refine and expand our marketing capabilities  our management of the investment process  our access to financing resources and our technology 
as we grow  we must continue to hire  train  supervise and manage new employees 
we may not develop sufficient lending and administrative personnel and management and operating systems to manage our expansion effectively 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operations could be adversely affected and our financial results could be adversely affected 
if we need to sell any of our investments  we may not be able to do so at a favorable price and  as a result  we may suffer losses 
our investments are usually subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid because there is usually no established trading market for such investments 
the illiquidity of most of our investments may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price  and  as a result  we may suffer losses 
in addition  if we were forced to immediately liquidate some or all of the investments in our portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation could be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
we may be required to liquidate some or all of our portfolio to meet our debt service obligations or to maintain our qualification as a business development company and as a regulated investment company if we do not satisfy one or more of the applicable criteria under the respective regulatory frameworks 
our business depends on our key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of bryan j 
mitchell  our chief executive officer  steven f 
tunney  our president and chief operating officer  b 
hagen saville  one of our executive vice presidents  and robert j 
merrick  our chief credit officer  as well as other key personnel 
mr 
mitchell was diagnosed in may with adenocarcinoma  a form of colon cancer  for which he was treated through surgery and a series of post operative treatments that ended in december mr 
mitchell s illness is in remission and has not significantly impaired his ability to perform his duties 
the loss of any of these key employees would likely have a significant detrimental effect on our business 
in addition  if any two of mr 
mitchell  mr 
saville  mr 
tunney or mr 
merrick cease to be actively involved in our management  the lender under one of our securitization facilities could  absent a waiver or cure  replace us as the servicer of the loans and declare a default 
fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our income 
a significant increase in market interest rates could harm our ability to attract new customers and originate new loans and investments  our non performing assets could increase and the value of our portfolio could decrease because our floating rate loan customers may be unable to meet higher payment obligations 
conversely  a significant decrease in interest rates would reduce our net income  all other things being equal 
approximately of the loans in our portfolio  based on amounts outstanding at fair value as of december   were at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark libor or prime rate and approximately were at fixed rates
