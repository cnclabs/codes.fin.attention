critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  vendor funds  intangible assets  income taxes  assets held for sale  impairment of long lived assets  self insurance  restructuring  benefit costs  contingencies  litigation and unearned income 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company  based on its ongoing review  will make adjustments to its judgments and estimates where facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain

the company also receives vendor funds for buying activities  such as volume commitment rebates and credits for purchasing products in advance of their need 
the terms of vendor funds arrangements vary in length  from short term arrangements that are completed within a quarter  to long term arrangements that are expected to be completed within ten years 
accounting for vendor funds is discussed in emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  which the company adopted as of the beginning of as a result of this guidance  the company began recognizing the vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of cost of sales when the related products are sold as opposed to the previous method of recognizing these credits as a reduction to cost of sales when the merchandising activity was performed in accordance with the underlying agreements 
vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions of inventory 
the amount of vendor funds remaining in ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates 
management estimates these amounts based on the average inventory turnover rates by product category for the company s grocery  general merchandise and lobby departments and by average inventory turnover rates by department for the company s remaining inventory 
the amount of vendor funds reducing the company s inventory inventory offset as of january  was  an increase of from the beginning of the vendor funds inventory offset as of january  was  a decrease of from the beginning of long lived asset impairments the company regularly reviews long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on operational performance 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long lived assets is impaired 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable  the fair value of the asset is compared to its carrying value 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of the assets is determined by internal real estate specialists or by independent quotes 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment and inflation 
for properties that have closed and are under long term operating lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using credit risk free rates and net of estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property  is recognized as a liability and charged to operations 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect net recoverable values 
internal real estate specialists estimate the subtenant income and asset recovery values based on their historical experience and knowledge of the market in which the store to be closed is located  the results of the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions 
the actual cost of disposition for these leases and related assets is affected by specific real estate markets  the economic environment and inflation 
goodwill the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in upon adoption  the aggregate of the goodwill allocated to the stores in each reporting unit became the reporting units goodwill balance 
in order to determine if a reporting unit s goodwill was impaired  a combination of internal analysis  focusing on each reporting unit s implied ebitda multiple and estimates of fair value from independent valuation specialists were used 
based on these analyses  there was no impairment of goodwill at the adoption date 
subsequently  during the fourth quarter of and  the company completed its annual impairment review and determined that there was no impairment 
the fair value estimates could change in the future depending on internal and external factors  including the success of strategic sourcing initiatives  labor cost controls and competitive activity 
self insurance the company is primarily self insured for property loss  workers compensation  automobile liability costs and general liability costs 
the company records its self insurance liability  determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
any actuarial projection of ultimate losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
sources of this variability are numerous and include  but are not limited to  future development of previous claims  future economic conditions  court decisions and legislative actions 
for example  workers compensation costs were  and in  and respectively 
the increase in costs was primarily attributable to development of prior year claims that were higher than previously estimated while the annual number of workers compensation claims has decreased year to year 
the company s workers compensation liabilities are from claims occurring in various states 
individual state workers compensation regulations have received a tremendous amount of attention from state politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen an escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting workers compensation 
the changes in a state s political and economic environment increase the variability in the unpaid claim liabilities 
the company s workers compensation reserves do not contemplate any of these potential developments 
legal contingencies the company records reserves for legal contingencies when the information available to the company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
predicting the outcomes of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposures involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates 
in addition  the company regularly monitors its exposure to the loss contingencies associated with these matters and may from time to time change its predictions with respect to outcomes and its estimates with respect to related costs and exposures 
it is possible that material differences in actual outcomes  costs and exposures relative to current predictions and estimates  or material changes in such predictions or estimates  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
pension costs pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are dependent on the company s selection of actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
actual returns on plan assets exceeded return assumptions over an extended period in the past  which kept pension expense and cash contributions to the plans at modest levels 
weaker market performance may significantly increase pension expense and cash contributions in the future 
changes in the interest rates used to determine the discount rate may also cause volatility in pension expense and cash contributions 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
for example  in the company s discount rate assumption was and its long term asset return assumption was 
using these assumptions  the company s pension expense was  following expense of in and income of in if the company had decreased its estimated discount rate to and its expected return on plan assets to  the company s pension expense would have been and net earnings would have decreased approximately if the company had increased its discount rate assumption to and its expected return on plan assets to  pension expense would have been and net earnings would have increased approximately recently issued and adopted accounting standards in july the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no
