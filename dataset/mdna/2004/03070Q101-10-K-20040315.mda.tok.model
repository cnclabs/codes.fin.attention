table of contents leading gaming technology slot machines are the core driver of our casino business 
we believe that leading our markets in slot machine trends is essential to our success 
the most significant innovation in slots today is ticket in  ticket out  which creates a more convenient coinless gambling experience for our customers and increases the revenue we earn on each machine 
we led our markets in the introduction of this technology and currently approximately of the slot machines at our ameristar branded properties have ticket in  ticket out capability 
we plan to increase this to approximately by the end of we were also the first operator in our markets to introduce a large supply of new generation nickel and penny video reel slot machines 
although many of our competitors now offer these machines  we believe that we gained a significant competitive advantage by leading this trend 
we also continue to focus on the most appropriate product mix 
we continually analyze slot utilization and slot machine win per unit and determine the most profitable slot machine mix 
marketing our marketing efforts are designed to support each of our properties as the number one casino and entertainment destination in their respective markets 
our multi tiered players clubs are designed to identify and reward guests based on their level of play 
our best players receive enhanced personalized service and additional benefits through our hosting and ambassador teams 
we communicate our entertainment and promotional activities to our guests through targeted direct mail as well as traditional media channels television  print  radio and outdoor advertising 
centralized operations since the inception of the company  we have developed a number of best practice processes and strategies for our operations 
we believe that we can enhance our revenues and minimize our costs by standardizing these practices across all properties 
we have centralized operations in marketing  food and beverage  hotel and gaming 
in administration  we have centralized many aspects of purchasing  accounts payable  human resources  information technology and other departments 
we build into these processes a high level of collaboration and communication among our six casino properties and our corporate team 
working together allows us to continually refine these processes and at the same time efficiently manage our business 
future expansion we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations through a variety of means  including entering new north american markets created by the legalization or expansion of casino gaming  developing new casinos or buying existing casinos in established north american casino gaming markets and expanding through continued growth at our existing properties 
although our preference is to own and operate each of our gaming properties  we may also consider expansion opportunities involving management contracts or joint ventures  including native american gaming opportunities 

table of contents we are also exploring expansion opportunities in the united kingdom in anticipation of the expected reform of that country s casino gaming laws 
draft legislation was published for comment by the government in late that would allow large scale modern casinos to be developed throughout the united kingdom 
government officials have announced intentions to introduce primary reform legislation in late or early  although no assurance has been given that this schedule will be adhered to 
the development of modern casinos would further require the adoption of secondary gaming legislation  the adoption of planning and tax policies conducive to attract development  the formation of a new regulatory agency and the adoption of regulations 
we continually review the operating performance of each of our existing properties and the feasibility of enhancing their performance through targeted capital expenditure programs 
in doing so  we assess the anticipated relative costs and benefits of the projects under consideration  the availability of cash flows and debt financing to fund capital expenditures and competitive and other relevant factors 
during  we intend to add more coinless slot machines at our properties  achieving a installed base at each of our ameristar branded properties  and begin a complete renovation of the hotel rooms at ameristar council bluffs and ameristar kansas city

further  the iowa legislature is considering a bill which  among other things  would permit the operation of table games and video poker at pari mutuel racetracks 
see risk factors for further discussion of these matters 
vicksburg ameristar vicksburg competes with three other gaming operations located in vicksburg 
in october  a change of ownership occurred at one of ameristar vicksburg s competitors 
we believe that  to date  the change in ownership has benefited ameristar vicksburg 
there were no major capital improvements or expansions by our vicksburg market competitors in the vicksburg market also faces regional competition from two casinos owned by a native american tribe in philadelphia  mississippi  located about miles east of jackson and miles east of vicksburg 
vicksburg is also subject to competition from four casinos and one slots only racetrack in shreveport and bossier city  louisiana  located approximately miles from vicksburg 
several potential gaming sites still exist in or near vicksburg and from time to time potential competitors have proposed the development of additional casinos 
in addition  proposals have been made from time to time to develop additional native american casinos in louisiana and mississippi  some of which could be competitive with the vicksburg market if completed 
jackpot the jackpot properties compete with four other hotels and motels three of which also have casinos in jackpot 
there were no major capital improvements or expansions in the jackpot market in we are not aware of any other expansion plans by existing or potential competitors in jackpot in the near future  however  casinos with video lottery terminals vlt similar to slot machines are operated on native american land in idaho  including one near pocatello with approximately vlt machines that is operated by the shoshone bannock tribes 
in november  the idaho electorate passed proposition  which legalized specific ticket pay gaming machines on native american reservations in the state  along with a limited growth plan allowing an increase of in machine count per year  not to exceed over the next years  with a subsequent renegotiation of compacts thereafter 
a legal challenge to proposition has been filed and is currently pending 
litigation is also pending concerning the scope of gaming permitted under the compact between the state of idaho and the shoshone bannock tribes 
in addition  casino gaming on native american lands in both western washington and northeastern oregon has been in operation for several years and casinos also operate in alberta  canada

incorporation ameristar was incorporated in nevada in risk factors the gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is very competitive and we face dynamic competitive pressures in each of our markets 
several of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
we may be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses 
our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations 
these restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain customers 
the legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could result in a significant increase in competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic difficulties faced by state governments  as well as the increased acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity  could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming 
from time to time  legislation and ballot measures have been unsuccessfully proposed in kansas and nebraska for the legalization of gaming 
in nebraska  proponents of referenda that would legalize various forms of casino gaming are soliciting signatures to place the referenda on the statewide ballot in november in both nebraska and kansas  bills have been introduced in the legislature for the legalization of casino gaming 
these proposals would authorize gaming in or near  among other places  omaha  nebraska and kansas city  kansas  in close proximity to our existing facilities in council bluffs  iowa and kansas city  missouri  respectively 
the legalization of gaming in these locations and the additional competition resulting from the subsequent development of competing gaming properties could have a material adverse effect on us 
even if the current proposals are unsuccessful  we expect similar proposals will be made in the future and may be adopted 
the missouri gaming commission has announced that it will consider applications for additional gaming licenses in the st 
louis area 
st 
louis city officials and members of the missouri gaming commission have also stated that they would like to see a currently operating casino in downtown st 
louis improved or replaced 
if one or more additional gaming licenses are issued in the st

louis improved  ameristar st 
charles would face additional competition 

table of contents the iowa racing and gaming commission recently approved the addition of slot machines for one of our competitors in council bluffs  and this competitor also plans to add a new buffet and certain other non gaming amenities 
additionally  the iowa legislature is currently considering a bill that would  among other things  eliminate the cruising requirements currently applicable to riverboat casinos and permit table games and video poker at pari mutuel racetracks which are currently limited to slot machines 
if enacted  we believe that ameristar council bluffs would be adversely affected by the operation of table games and video poker at the competing racetrack casino in council bluffs 
native american gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state licensed casinos  which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets 
recently  our jackpot properties have seen intensified competition from an idaho native american facility that is closer to a portion of our market area 
the entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  internet and other account wagering and gaming services  which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play las vegas style casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees  our results could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
periods of economic downturn and budget deficits such as currently exist in many states may intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in  large gaming tax increases were enacted in illinois and indiana 
in  illinois enacted an additional large gaming tax increase  the state of new jersey increased various taxes on casinos and casino patrons and the state of nevada increased its tax on gross gaming revenues from to 
the iowa supreme court ruled in that the differential in the maximum gaming tax rate applicable to slot operations at racetracks and riverboat casinos violates the equal protection clauses of the iowa and united states constitutions  and a lower state court subsequently ruled that the racetracks were due a refund of taxes paid in excess of a rate for prior periods 
this decision was reversed by the united states supreme court in with respect to those portions of its decision that relied on federal law 
however  in february  the iowa supreme court reaffirmed its holding based solely on state constitutional grounds 
in order to overcome the budgetary constraints resulting from this court decision  the iowa legislature is currently considering a bill which would  among other things  increase the maximum gaming tax rate on riverboat casinos from to 

table of contents several bills have recently been introduced in the missouri legislature that would increase the gaming tax rate and eliminate the existing loss limit per two hour cruise 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees  depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors such as the elimination of the loss limit in missouri  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the states of missouri  iowa  mississippi and nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries 
the missouri gaming commission  the iowa racing and gaming commission  the mississippi gaming commission and the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our missouri  iowa  mississippi or nevada subsidiaries  respectively  for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
our licenses in missouri need to be renewed every two years  our gaming license in iowa must be renewed or continued every year  and our gaming license in mississippi must be renewed every three years 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved  and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities 
however  gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under the laws of all the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that our existing licenses  permits and approvals will be maintained or extended 
we also cannot assure you that any new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 
financial leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations 
our leverage ratio as defined in our senior credit facilities has improved from as of december  to as of december   and our total indebtedness including obligations under capital leases has decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  however  the degree to which we are leveraged could have important adverse consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  
table of contents requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 
the terms of our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that may restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facilities and the indenture are subject to various exceptions that are intended to allow us to operate without undue restraint in certain anticipated circumstances  we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities and the indenture 
if an event of default under our senior credit facilities occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facilities are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
worsening economic conditions or geopolitical circumstances may adversely affect our business 
our business may be adversely affected by economic downturns and instability  as we are dependent on discretionary spending by our customers 
any worsening of current economic conditions could cause fewer people to spend money at our properties and could adversely affect our revenues 
other geopolitical events  such as terrorism or the threat of terrorism  may deter customers from visiting our properties 
we have limited opportunities to grow our business 
the casino gaming industry has limited growth opportunities 
most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses 
although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming  in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations  such as pari mutuel racetracks 
moreover  it is not clear whether the tax  land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially acceptable 
we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities that do arise  and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources than we do 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our business

certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes 
this acceleration could be triggered in the event mr 
neilsen sells a significant portion of his stock or upon his death if his estate  private foundation  heirs or devisees sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock  which they might have to do in order to pay estate tax liabilities or satisfy legal requirements applicable to shareholdings by private foundations 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the travel and tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 
recently  the us coast guard promulgated regulations under the maritime transportation security act of which apply to facilities and vessels on or near navigable waterways 
these regulations require  among other measures  patrons of such facilities to undergo security screening and physical search and to produce photo identification 
however  we recently received approval from the coast guard to utilize an alternative program that will allow us to avoid imposition of many of the most intrusive measures of the new regulations 
we do not anticipate that the costs associated with the implementation of the alternative program will be material 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological 
table of contents problems  weather interference  floods  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we employ fast track design and construction methods in some of our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway 
although we believe that the use of fast track design and construction methods can reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  may involve additional construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of funds under our senior credit facilities at any time will be dependent upon  among other factors  the amount of our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda during the preceding four full fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our future consolidated ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete current or future construction projects 
as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure you that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
if any of our key personnel leaves us  our business may be significantly affected 
we depend on the continued performance of craig h 
neilsen  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and the rest of our management team 
if we lose the services of mr 
neilsen  any of our other key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the market for qualified property and corporate management personnel is subject to intense competition 

table of contents we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel 
recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel is particularly difficult at ameristar vicksburg and the jackpot properties due to local market conditions 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
adverse weather conditions in the areas in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if our midwestern properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our riverboat and barge facilities could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
cruises of the council bluffs casino vessel are subject to risks generally incident to the movement of vessels on inland waterways  including risks of casualty due to river turbulence  other vessels and severe weather conditions 
in addition  us coast guard regulations set limits on the operation of vessels and require that vessels be operated by a minimum complement of licensed personnel 
the us coast guard also requires all united states flagged passenger vessels operating exclusively in fresh water to conduct a thorough dry dock inspection of underwater machinery  valves and hull every five years 
less stringent inspection requirements apply to permanently moored barges like those at ameristar kansas city  ameristar st 
charles and ameristar vicksburg 
the ameristar council bluffs riverboat was due for its dry dock inspection in november  but we have been accepted into a us coast guard program that has extended the dry dock requirement to october by undergoing a thorough underwater inspection 
we may be unable to further extend the dry dock requirement  and a dry dock inspection would take the council bluffs casino out of service for a substantial period of time 
this could have a material adverse effect on ameristar council bluffs and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will actually obtain any further extension of the dry dock requirement or that similar extensions will be obtained in the future 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced some geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although we reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel floats in  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site to evaluate what further steps  if any  may be necessary to stabilize the site to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of a riverboat or barge facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our long term debt facilities 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our credit agreement 

table of contents we could face severe penalties and material remediation costs if we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
as is the case with any owner or operator of real property  we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by government agencies or courts  which could adversely affect our operations 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities 
government regulation the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
we are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming 
the limitation  conditioning or suspension of gaming licenses could and the revocation or non renewal of gaming licenses  or the failure to reauthorize gaming in certain jurisdictions  would materially adversely affect our operations in that jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in law that restrict or prohibit our gaming operations in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on us

a pledge of the stock of a mississippi gaming subsidiary and the foreclosure of such a pledge are ineffective without the prior approval of the mississippi commission 
moreover  restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued by a mississippi gaming subsidiary or its holding companies and agreements not to encumber the securities of a holding company are ineffective without the prior approval of the mississippi commission 
we have obtained approvals from the mississippi commission for such guarantees  pledges and restrictions in connection with offerings of securities  subject to certain restrictions  but we must obtain separate prior approvals from the mississippi commission for pledges and stock restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions 
moreover  the regulations of the mississippi commission require us to file a loan to licensees report within days following certain financing transactions and the offering of certain debt securities

the mississippi legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management  repurchases of voting securities and other corporate defense tactics that affect corporate gaming licensees in mississippi and registered corporations may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming 
the mississippi commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon mississippi s gaming industry and to further mississippi s policy to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates  preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form  and promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs 
approvals are  in certain circumstances  required from the mississippi commission before a registered corporation may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities such as repurchases which treat holders differently in excess of the current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated 
mississippi s gaming regulations also require prior approval by the mississippi commission of a plan of recapitalization proposed by the registered corporation s board of directors in response to a 
table of contents tender offer made directly to the registered corporation s stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of the registered corporation

we previously have obtained a waiver of foreign gaming approval from the mississippi commission for operations in other states in which we conduct gaming operations and will be required to obtain the approval or a waiver of such approval from the mississippi commission prior to engaging in any additional future gaming operations outside of mississippi 
if the mississippi commission were to determine that we or acvi had violated a gaming law or regulation  the mississippi commission could limit  condition  suspend or revoke our approvals and the license of acvi  subject to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures 
in addition  we  acvi and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation 
because of such a violation  the mississippi commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities 
limitation  conditioning or suspension of any gaming license or approval or the appointment of a supervisor could and revocation of any gaming license or approval would materially adversely affect us  our gaming operations and our results of operations 
license fees and taxes  computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved  are payable to the state of mississippi and to the counties and cities in which a mississippi gaming subsidiary s operations are conducted 
depending upon the particular fee or tax involved  these fees and taxes are payable either monthly  quarterly or annually 
gaming taxes are based upon the following a percentage of the gross gaming revenues received by the casino operation  the number of gaming devices operated by the casino  or the number of table games operated by the casino 
the license fee payable to the state of mississippi is based upon gaming receipts generally defined as gross receipts less payouts to customers as winnings and the current maximum tax rate imposed is of all gaming receipts in excess of  per month 
the foregoing license fees we pay are allowed as a credit against acvi s mississippi income tax liability for the year paid 
the gross revenues fee imposed by the city of vicksburg equals approximately of gaming receipts 
the mississippi commission s regulations require as a condition of licensure or license renewal that an existing licensed gaming establishment s plan include a car parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which amount to at least of the casino cost 
the mississippi commission later adopted amendments to the regulation that would increase the infrastructure development requirement from to for new casinos or upon the acquisition of a closed casino  but would grandfather existing licensees 
we believe that acvi is in compliance with the previously existing infrastructure requirement and is not subject to the increased infrastructure requirement

another significant operating use of cash in is interest payments 
our cash interest payments were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect our cash interest payments to decrease in as a result of the february amendment to our senior credit facilities  which is described in note notes payable and long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business  including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole 
our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  which reduced the amount available to borrow under our senior credit facilities 
we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
for more information  see note notes payable and long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 

table of contents excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired at december  we had approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of the missouri properties in december according to the requirements of sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   we completed our initial assessment and our annual assessment for impairment and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the assessment in both cases requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine its estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
star awards program our customer reward program  star awards  allows customers to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the customers gaming activity 
customers can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program 
the reward credit balance is forfeited if a customer does not earn any reward credits over any subsequent month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was accrued 
the value of these point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services are netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 
cash coupons our former  current and future players may be awarded  on a discretionary basis  cash coupons based  in part  on their play volume 
the coupons are redeemable within a short time period  generally seven days  and are redeemable only on a return visit 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed 
self funded employee health care insurance program our employee health care benefits program is self funded up to a maximum amount per claim 
accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
at december  and  our estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled million and million  respectively 
we consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities  based upon statistical data provided by the independent third party administrator of the health care benefits program 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
we continually monitor the potential for changes in estimates  evaluate our insurance accruals and adjust our recorded provisions 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets and million of deferred tax liabilities 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue services and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on historical precedent 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period in which the examination issues are settled
