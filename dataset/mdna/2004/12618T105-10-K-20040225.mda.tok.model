item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading economic and business consulting firm that applies advanced analytic techniques and in depth industry knowledge to complex engagements for a broad range of clients 
we offer two types of services legal and regulatory consulting and business consulting 
we estimate that we derived approximately of our revenues in fiscal from business consulting and legal and regulatory consulting  and approximately from neuco  a subsidiary of which we own 
neuco develops and markets a family of neural network software tools and complementary application consulting services that are currently focused on electricity generation by utilities 
we derive revenues principally from professional services rendered by our employee consultants 
in most instances  we charge clients on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues in the period when we provide our services 
we charge consultants time at hourly rates  which vary from consultant to consultant depending on a consultant s position  experience  and expertise  and other factors 
we derive a portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts 
revenues from fixed price engagements are recognized using a proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred  substantially all of which are labor related  to the total estimated project costs 
we derived and of our revenues from fixed price engagements in fiscal and  respectively 
we generate substantially all of our professional services fees from the work of our own employee consultants and a portion from the work of our outside experts 
factors that affect our professional services revenues include the number and scope of client engagements  the number of consultants we employ  the consultants billing rates  and the number of hours our consultants work 
revenues also include expenses billed to clients  which include travel and other out of pocket expenses  outside consultants  and other reimbursable expenses 
our costs of services include the salaries  bonuses  and benefits of our employee consultants 
our bonus program awards discretionary bonuses based on our revenues and profitability and individual performance 
costs of services also include out of pocket and other expenses that are billed to clients  and the salaries  bonuses  and benefits of support staff whose time is billed directly to clients  such as librarians  editors  and programmers 
our gross profit  which equals revenues less costs of services  is affected by changes in our mix of revenues 
we experience significantly higher gross margins on revenues from professional service fees than on revenues from expenses billed to clients 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries  bonuses  and benefits of our administrative and support staff  fees to outside experts for generating new business  office rent  marketing  and other costs 
utilization because we derive the majority of our revenues from hourly billings by our employee consultants  our utilization of those employee consultants is one key indicator that we use to measure our operating performance 
we calculate utilization by dividing the total hours worked by our employee consultants on engagements during the measurement period by the total number of hours that our employee consultants were available to work during that period 
utilization was percent for fiscal  percent for fiscal  and percent for fiscal historically  we have experienced higher utilization in our legal and regulatory consulting practice than in our business consulting practice because our business consulting practice devotes a greater portion of its time to sales and marketing efforts 
fiscal periods our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in november  and accordingly  our fiscal year will periodically contain weeks rather than weeks 
in particular  fiscal contained weeks 
this additional week of operations in fiscal will affect the comparability of results of operations of this fiscal year with other fiscal years 
historically  we have managed our business based on four week billing cycles to clients and  consequently  have established quarters that are divisible by four week periods 
as a result  the first  second  and fourth quarters of each fiscal year are week periods  and the third quarter of each fiscal year is a week period 
however  the fourth quarter in fiscal was weeks long 
accordingly  period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful if the periods being compared have different lengths 
the additional week in fiscal resulted in million of revenues and was not material to our results of operations 
the terms fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal refer to the week periods ended november   november   november   the week period ended november   and the week period ended november   respectively 
acquisitions and international expansion on october   we acquired the consulting business of dr 
gordon c 
rausser for million in cash 
if the acquired business meets specified performance targets  we will owe dr 
rausser additional consideration  payable in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we loaned dr 
rausser million  on a full recourse basis  for the purchase of our common stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method  and the results have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
we are currently in discussion with dr 
rausser  who may agree to extend substantially the duration of his exclusive relationship with us  and we may agree to extend the time for the repayment of his loan and for him to meet his specified performance targets 
on july   we acquired certain assets from pa consulting group  inc for million in notes 
the acquisition has been accounted for under purchase accounting  and the results of operations have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
in april and may  we completed the acquisitions of certain assets of the north american and uk operations of the chemicals and energy vertical practice cev of the then arthur d 
little corporation adl for an aggregate of million in cash 
arthur d 
little  inc is now known as dehon  inc the acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the effective date of the acquisition of the north american business was april   and the effective date of the acquisition of the uk business was may  the results of operations related to the acquisitions have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the respective effective dates 
we believe that the acquisition of the cev business enhanced our position in consulting to the chemicals and petroleum industries 
we acquired employee consultants  accounts receivable  and the ongoing client projects being handled by the acquired employee consultants 
of the million purchase price  million was recorded as intangibles  consisting primarily of customer relationships  million was recorded primarily as accounts receivable  and the remaining million was recorded as goodwill  all of which is expected to be deducted for tax purposes 
the portion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill primarily related to the extensive industry experience of the acquired employee consultants 
in fiscal  our international operations grew moderately 
our international revenues for fiscal reflect a full year of operations of the uk portion of the cev business that we acquired in may revenues from our international operations accounted for   and  of our total revenues in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively  as more fully described in note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the arthur d 
little and adl trademarks were purchased by a third party 
software subsidiary in june  we acquired a majority interest in neuco  inc neuco was established by us and an affiliate of commonwealth energy systems as a start up entity to develop and market a family of neural network software tools and complementary application consulting services for electric utilities 
neuco s financial statements are consolidated with our financial statements 
neuco recognized revenues of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal neuco generated a net profit of approximately  in fiscal  sustained a net loss of approximately million in fiscal  and generated a net profit of  in fiscal as of november   our interest in neuco was percent 
in march  neuco repurchased and cancelled shares from a minority interest stockholder  which increased our interest in neuco to percent from percent 
this transaction has been recorded as an adjustment of capital 
at november   our percent interest in neuco  combined with other considerations  represented control 
the portion of the results of operations of neuco allocable to its other owners is shown as minority interest on our statement of income  and that amount  along with the capital contributions to neuco of its other owners  is shown as minority interest on our balance sheet 
all significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if our assumptions based on past experience or our other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the performance of professional services 
the contracts that we enter into and operate under specify whether the engagement will be billed on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
typically  these engagements are of a short  predetermined time frame and generally last three to six months  although some of our engagements can be much longer in duration 
each contract must be approved by one of our vice presidents 
we recognize substantially all of our revenues under written service contracts with our clients 
revenues from time and materials service contracts are recognized as the services are provided based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates  as well as a computer services fee based upon hours worked 
revenues from fixed price engagements are recognized on a proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred  substantially all of which are labor related  to the total estimated project costs 
project costs are based on the direct salary and associated fringe benefits of the consultants on the engagement plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement that are not reimbursed by the client 
the proportional performance method is used since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and terms set forth in the contract  and are indicative of the level of benefit provided to our clients 
our fixed price contracts generally include a termination provision that reduces the agreement to a time and materials contract in the event of termination of the contract 
there are no costs that are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
our financial management maintains contact with project managers to discuss the status of the projects and  for fixed price engagements  financial management is updated on the budgeted costs and resources required to complete the project 
these budgets are then used to calculate revenue recognition and to estimate the anticipated income or loss on the project 
in the past  we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which have resulted in lower than anticipated income or losses on those contracts 
we may experience similar situations in the future 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
revenues also include expenses billed to clients  which include travel and other out of pocket expenses  outside consultants  and other reimbursable expenses 
these reimbursable expenses included in revenues are as follows in thousands year ended november  november  november  reimbursable expenses billed to clients    we recognize revenues for services only in those situations where collection from the client is reasonably assured 
our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
for fiscal and fiscal  our average days sales outstanding dsos were days and days  respectively 
we calculate dsos by dividing the sum of our accounts receivable and unbilled services balance  net of deferred revenue  at the end of the quarter by daily revenues 
daily revenues are calculated by dividing quarter revenues by the number of days in a quarter 
our project managers and finance personnel monitor payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy  and relationship of our accounts receivable and revenues 
in determining these estimates  we examine historical write offs of our receivables and review client accounts to identify any specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to estimate accurately the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as of november  and november   million and million  respectively  were provided for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for our acquisitions of consolidated companies under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their expected useful lives 
intangible assets consist principally of non competition agreements and customer relationships and are generally amortized over five to ten years 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets  of acquired businesses that are consolidated 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted in fiscal  we ceased amortizing goodwill arising from acquisitions 
in lieu of amortization  we perform an impairment review of our goodwill annually  or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment 
there were no impairment losses related to goodwill due to the application of sfas no 
in fiscal and fiscal if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of income 
the net amount of goodwill was approximately million as of november  we assess the impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the net amount of intangible assets was approximately million as of november  accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that result from temporary differences between book and tax accounting  as well as net operating loss carryforwards 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
as a result of operating losses incurred in certain of our foreign subsidiaries  anticipated additional operating losses in the future  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we recorded valuation allowances in certain of these foreign subsidiaries based on the facts and circumstances affecting each subsidiary 
had we not recorded these allowances  we would have reported a lower effective tax rate than that recognized in our statements of income in fiscal if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state  or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction  and as a result of acquisitions 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  and later amended in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 

fin no 
is an interpretation of arb no 
and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  or vies 
this interpretation is based on the theory that an enterprise controlling another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
business enterprises are required under the provisions of this interpretation to identify vies  based on specified characteristics  and then determine whether they should be consolidated 
an enterprise that holds a majority of the variable interests is considered the primary beneficiary and is the enterprise that should consolidate the vie 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is also required to include various disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements 
additionally  an enterprise that holds a significant variable interest in a vie  but that is not the primary beneficiary  is also required to make certain disclosures 
this interpretation  as amended  is effective for all enterprises with a variable interest in vies created after january  for variable interests in a vie created before february   we are required to apply the provisions of this interpretation to that entity by the end of the first interim or annual reporting period that ends after march  as of november   we had no interests in any vie 
we do not believe that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table provides operating information as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended november  weeks november  weeks november  weeks revenues costs of services gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations interest income  net income before provision for income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal we experienced revenue increases in fiscal primarily in our chemicals and petroleum  materials and manufacturing  competition  finance  and energy and environment practice areas 
these increases were partially offset by a revenue decrease in our transportation practice area 
the increase in revenues was effected by an increase in utilization  increased billing rates for our employee consultants  an increase in the average number of employee consultants  and an increase in expenses billed to clients 
the total number of employee consultants decreased to at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal however  the average number of our employee consultants for fiscal was higher than the average for fiscal  largely because the average for fiscal includes the employee consultants hired in connection with the acquisition of the cev business only for a portion of that year 
utilization was for fiscal as compared with for fiscal revenues derived from fixed price engagements increased to of total revenues for fiscal from for fiscal this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of the cev business in fiscal  which traditionally entered into fixed price engagements 
costs of services 
costs of services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an overall increase in compensation expense for our employee consultants of million  an increase in reimbursable expenses billed to clients of million  and an increase of million attributable to an increase in the average number of employee consultants 
as a percentage of revenues  costs of services decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to increased leverage arising from higher utilization of our employee consultants 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in overall compensation to our administrative staff of million  an increase in commission payments to outside experts of million  an increase in rent expense of million  and an increase in other selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the primary contributors to the decrease as a percentage of revenues were relative decreases in travel expenses  legal and other professional fees  as well as an overall increase in revenue at a greater rate than the increases in those selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include rent and other costs that are principally fixed in nature 
these decreases were partially offset by a revenue related increase in commission payments to outside experts 
interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other income decreased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from foreign exchange losses and the overall decline in short term interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the slightly higher rate in fiscal was due primarily to a higher federal statutory rate because the growth in our net income pushed us into the top tax bracket 
minority interest 
minority interest in the results of operations of neuco changed to a profit of  in fiscal from a loss of  in fiscal due to an increase in profits in neuco 
net income 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal diluted net income per share increased by to per share from per share 
net income increased at a greater rate than diluted net income per share due to the dilutive impact of the additional shares issued as a result of the public offering of our common stock completed in august   the exercise of approximately thousand options during fiscal  and the increase in the number of outstanding in the money stock options 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of employee consultants  particularly as a result of the acquisition of the cev business  increased billing rates for our consultants  and to a lesser extent  an additional week of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in utilization and a decrease in neuco revenue 
utilization was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal average utilization decreased in fiscal in part because of the acquisition from adl  and otherwise would have averaged for the year 
the total number of employee consultants increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal we experienced significant revenue increases during fiscal primarily in our chemicals and petroleum  finance  and electric utility practice areas 
costs of services 
costs of services increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of employee consultants  particularly those acquired from adl  and to a lesser extent  an overall increase in salaries and bonuses paid to our employee consultants 
as a percentage of revenues  costs of services increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to lower utilization of our employee consultants  particularly as a result of the business acquired from adl  where the related employee consultants were not immediately utilized to the same extent as our other employees 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary contributors to the decrease as a percentage of revenues were a decrease in amortization of goodwill resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
and a decrease in commission payments to outside experts 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in overall compensation for administrative staff and rent expense 
interest and other income  net 
net interest income decreased by  or  from million in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from the overall decline in short term interest rates during fiscal and an increase in interest expense related to notes payable 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was unchanged at in fiscal and fiscal although our effective tax rate was unchanged  neuco s net losses  some of which neuco cannot receive a current tax benefit  were offset by the use of certain net operating losses in mexico that were previously fully reserved 
minority interest 
minority interest in the results of operations of neuco decreased from a gain of  in fiscal to a loss of  in fiscal due to a change from profit at neuco in fiscal to a loss in fiscal liquidity and capital resources general 
in fiscal  we had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
we completed the year with cash and cash equivalents of million  short term and long term investments of million  and working capital of million 
we believe that current cash balances  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
sources of cash in fiscal during fiscal  we generated cash primarily from three sources cash provided by our operating activities  proceeds from a public offering of our common stock  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our operating activities provided net cash of million  resulting primarily from net income of million and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities of million 
the increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation for our employee consultants  which will be paid in the first and second quarters of fiscal the increase in cash generated from operating activities was offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
we received net proceeds of million from a public offering of our common stock that we completed in august during fiscal  we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net sales of investments in fiscal contributed an additional million 
additional cash resources 
in fiscal  we had a line of credit agreement that permitted borrowings of up to million with interest at the bank s base rate percent at november  and percent at november  
borrowings under the agreement were secured by our accounts receivable 
the terms of the line of credit included certain operating and financial covenants 
no borrowings were outstanding as of november  and november  we terminated this line of credit in january on january   we entered into a senior loan agreement with a bank for a two year  million revolving line of credit 
subject to the terms of the agreement  we may use borrowings under this line of credit for acquisition financing  working capital  general corporate purposes  letters of credit  and foreign exchanges contracts 
as of february   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
we must repay any borrowings under the line of credit no later than january  borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  either at libor plus an applicable margin or at the prime rate 
applicable margins range from to  depending on the ratio of our consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  for the preceding four fiscal quarters  subject to various adjustments stated in the senior loan agreement 
these margins are adjusted both quarterly and each time we borrow under the credit facility 
a commitment fee of is payable on the unused portion of the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by of the stock of our us subsidiary cra security corporation and by of the stock of our foreign subsidiaries  amounting to net assets of approximately million as of november  as part of our business  we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other consulting firms  practices or groups or other businesses 
in recent years  we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash  and we may continue to do so in the future 
to pay for an acquisition  we may use cash on hand  cash generated from our operations or borrowings under our revolving credit facility  or we may pursue other forms of debt or equity financing  including public and private offerings of common stock  convertible subordinated debt securities or other securities 
our ability to secure short term and long term debt or equity financing in the future will depend on several factors  including our future profitability  the levels of our debt and equity and the overall credit and equity market environments 
in connection with our acquisition of the consulting business of dr 
rausser  we loaned dr 
rausser million  which he used to purchase shares of our common stock 
the loan is scheduled to be repaid in and is collateralized by shares of the company 
if the acquired business meets specified performance targets  we will owe dr 
rausser additional consideration  payable in the first quarter of fiscal uses of cash in fiscal during fiscal  we used cash primarily for capital expenditures 
we spent million to purchase property and equipment 
other uses of cash in fiscal included approximately million used to make the final payment on notes payable in connection with our july acquisition of a line of business from pa consulting group  inc  approximately million used by neuco to repurchase shares from a minority interest stockholder  and approximately million to make payments on amounts owed to former stockholders 
debt restrictions 
under our senior credit agreement  we must comply with various financial and non financial covenants 
the financial covenants require us to maintain a minimum consolidated working capital of million and require us to comply with a consolidated total debt to ebitda ratio of not more than to and a consolidated senior debt to ebitda ratio of not more than to compliance with these financial covenants is tested on a fiscal quarterly basis  commencing with the first quarter of fiscal also  the senior credit agreement prohibits us from paying dividends and places restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  repurchase our securities  make acquisitions and dispositions  and enter into business combinations 
any indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility may become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of stated events of default  including our failure to pay principal  interest or fees or a violation of any financial covenant 
as of february   we were in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit agreement 
impact of inflation 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
factors affecting future performance we depend upon only a few key employees to generate revenue our business consists primarily of the delivery of professional services  and accordingly  our success depends heavily on the efforts  abilities  business generation capabilities  and project execution capabilities of our employee consultants 
in particular  our employee consultants personal relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
if we lose the services of any employee consultant or if our employee consultants fail to generate business or otherwise fail to perform effectively  that loss or failure could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our employee consultants generated engagements that accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal and in fiscal our top five employee consultants generated approximately of our revenues in fiscal and in fiscal we do not have any employment agreements with most of our employee consultants  and they can terminate their relationships with us at will and without notice 
the non competition and non solicitation agreements that we have with some of our employee consultants offer us only limited protection and may not be enforceable in every jurisdiction 
our failure to manage growth successfully could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations any failure on our part to manage growth successfully could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
over the last several years  we have continued to open offices in new geographic areas  including foreign locations  and to expand our employee base as a result of internal growth and acquisitions 
we expect that this trend will continue over the long term 
opening and managing new offices often requires extensive management supervision and increases our overall selling  general  and administrative expenses 
expansion creates new and increased management  consulting  and training responsibilities for our employee consultants 
expansion also increases the demands on our internal systems  procedures  and controls  and on our managerial  administrative  financial  marketing  and other resources 
we depend heavily upon the managerial  operational  and administrative skills of our officers  particularly james c 
burrows  our president and chief executive officer  to manage our expansion 
new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect the overall quality of our work 
our entry into new lines of business could adversely affect our results of operations if we attempt to develop new practice areas or lines of business outside our core economic and business consulting services  those efforts could harm our results of operations 
our efforts in new practice areas or new lines of business involve inherent risks  including risks associated with inexperience and competition from mature participants in the markets we enter 
our inexperience may result in costly decisions that could harm our business 
for example  neuco  our majority owned software subsidiary  was not profitable in three of the last five fiscal years  which harmed our results of operations in those years 
clients can terminate engagements with us at any time many of our engagements depend upon disputes  proceedings  or transactions that involve our clients 
our clients may decide at any time to seek to resolve the dispute or proceeding  abandon the transaction  or file for bankruptcy 
our engagements can therefore terminate suddenly and without advance notice to us 
if an engagement is terminated unexpectedly  our employee consultants working on the engagement could be underutilized until we assign them to other projects 
in addition  because much of our work is project based rather than recurring in nature  our consultants utilization depends on our ability to secure additional engagements on a continual basis 
accordingly  the termination or significant reduction in the scope of a single large engagement could reduce our utilization and have an immediate adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we depend on our antitrust and mergers and acquisitions consulting business we derived approximately of our revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal from engagements in our antitrust and mergers and acquisitions practice areas 
any substantial reduction in the number or size of our engagements in these practice areas could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we derived the great majority of these revenues from engagements relating to enforcement of united states antitrust laws 
changes in federal antitrust laws  changes in judicial interpretations of these laws  or less vigorous enforcement of these laws as a result of changes in political appointments or priorities or for other reasons could substantially reduce our revenues from engagements in this area 
in addition  adverse changes in general economic conditions  particularly conditions influencing the merger and acquisition activity of larger companies  could adversely affect engagements in which we assist clients in proceedings before the us department of justice and the us federal trade commission 
the recent economic slowdown may continue to have an adverse effect on mergers and acquisitions activity  which has reduced the number and scope of our engagements in this practice area in recent periods 
any continuation or worsening of the downturn could cause this trend to intensify  which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we derive our revenues from a limited number of large engagements we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large engagements 
if we do not obtain a significant number of new large engagements each year  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could suffer 
our ten largest engagements accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal and in each of fiscal and our ten largest clients accounted for approximately   and of our revenues in those years  respectively 
in general  the volume of work we perform for any particular client varies from year to year  and a major client in one year may not hire us again 
we enter into fixed price engagements we derive a significant portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts 
these contracts are more common in our business consulting practice  and would likely grow in number with any expansion of that practice 
if we fail to estimate accurately the resources required for a fixed price project or fail to satisfy our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project budget  we might generate a smaller profit or incur a loss on the project 
on occasion  we have had to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  and we may have to take similar action in the future  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our business could suffer if we are unable to hire additional qualified consultants as employees our business continually requires us to hire highly qualified  highly educated consultants as employees 
our failure to recruit and retain a significant number of qualified employee consultants could limit our ability to accept or complete engagements and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
relatively few potential employees meet our hiring criteria  and we face significant competition for these employees from our direct competitors  academic institutions  government agencies  research firms  investment banking firms  and other enterprises 
many of these competing employers are able to offer potential employees significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths  or geographic locations than we can 
competition for these employee consultants has increased our labor costs  and a continuation of this trend could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations 
we depend on our outside experts we depend on our relationships with our exclusive outside experts 
in fiscal and fiscal  six of our exclusive outside experts generated engagements that accounted for approximately and of our revenues in those years  respectively 
we believe that these outside experts are highly regarded in their fields and that each offers a combination of knowledge  experience  and expertise that would be very difficult to replace 
we also believe that we have been able to secure some engagements and attract consultants in part because we could offer the services of these outside experts 
most of these outside experts can limit their relationships with us at any time for any reason 
these reasons could include affiliations with universities with policies that prohibit accepting specified engagements  the pursuit of other interests  and retirement 
as of november   we had non competition agreements with of our outside experts 
the limitation or termination of any of their relationships with us  or competition from any of them after these agreements expire  could harm our reputation  reduce our business opportunities and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
to meet our long term growth targets  we need to establish ongoing relationships with additional outside experts who have reputations as leading experts in their fields 
we may be unable to establish relationships with any additional outside experts 
in addition  any relationship that we do establish may not help us meet our objectives or generate the revenues or earnings that we anticipate 
acquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses 
the expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we acquire a business  we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own 
moreover  we may be unable to realize the financial  operational  and other benefits we anticipate from any acquisition 
competition for future acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets 
further  acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks  such as charges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw  diversion of our management s time  attention  and resources  decreased utilization during the integration process  loss of key acquired personnel  increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial  operational  financial  and administrative systems including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  dilutive issuances of equity securities  the assumption of legal liabilities  amortization of acquired intangible assets  potential write offs related to the impairment of goodwill  difficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures  and additional conflicts of interests 
our international operations create special risks we may continue our international expansion  and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial and business risks  including greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  cultural differences that result in lower utilization  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs  and other barriers  greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  longer sales cycles  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  potentially adverse tax consequences  such as trapped foreign losses  less stable political and economic environments  and civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity 
particularly as a result of the acquisition of the cev business  we conduct a portion of our business in the middle east 
the recent military conflict in the region has significantly interrupted our business operations in that region and has slowed the flow of new opportunities and proposals  which ultimately has adversely affected our revenues and results of operations 
if our international revenues increase relative to our total revenues  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on our operating results 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations from one quarter to the next 
if our revenues or net income in a quarter fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock could fall significantly 
our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons  including the number of weeks in our fiscal quarter  the number  scope  and timing of ongoing client engagements  the extent to which we can reassign employee consultants efficiently from one engagement to the next  the extent to which our employee consultants take holiday  vacation  and sick time  employee hiring  the extent of fees discounting or cost overruns  fluctuations in revenues and results of operations of our software subsidiary  neuco  severe weather conditions and other factors affecting employee productivity  and collectibility of receivables and unbilled work in process 
because we generate the majority of our revenues from consulting services that we provide on an hourly fee basis  our revenues in any period are directly related to the number of our employee consultants  their billing rates  and the number of billable hours they work in that period 
we have a limited ability to increase any of these factors in the short term 
accordingly  if we underutilize our consultants during one part of a fiscal period  we may be unable to compensate by augmenting revenues during another part of that period 
in addition  we are occasionally unable to utilize fully any additional consultants that we hire  particularly in the quarter in which we hire them 
moreover  a significant majority of our operating expenses  primarily office rent and salaries  are fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenues fail to meet our projections in any quarter  that could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our net income 
for these reasons  we believe our historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
potential conflicts of interests may preclude us from accepting some engagements we provide our services primarily in connection with significant or complex transactions  disputes  or other matters that are usually adversarial or that involve sensitive client information 
our engagement by a client may preclude us from accepting engagements with the client s competitors or adversaries because of conflicts between their business interests or positions on disputed issues or other reasons 
accordingly  the nature of our business limits the number of both potential clients and potential engagements 
moreover  in many industries in which we provide consulting services  such as in the telecommunications industry  there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances 
these consolidations and alliances reduce the number of potential clients for our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to continue some of our ongoing engagements or accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interests 
maintaining our professional reputation is crucial to our future success our ability to secure new engagements and hire qualified consultants as employees depends heavily on our overall reputation as well as the individual reputations of our employee consultants and principal outside experts 
because we obtain a majority of our new engagements from existing clients or from referrals by those clients  any client that is dissatisfied with our performance on a single matter could seriously impair our ability to secure new engagements 
given the frequently high profile nature of the matters on which we work  any factor that diminishes our reputation or the reputations of any of our employee consultants or outside experts could make it substantially more difficult for us to compete successfully for both new engagements and qualified consultants 
intense competition from other economic and business consulting firms could hurt our business the market for economic and business consulting services is intensely competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors 
in general  there are few barriers to entry into our markets  and we expect to face additional competition from new entrants into the economic and business consulting industries 
in the legal and regulatory consulting market  we compete primarily with other economic and financial consulting firms and individual academics 
in the business consulting market  we compete primarily with other business and management consulting firms  specialized or industry specific consulting firms  the consulting practices of large accounting firms  and the internal professional resources of existing and potential clients 
many of our competitors have national or international reputations as well as significantly greater personnel  financial  managerial  technical  and marketing resources than we do  which could enhance their ability to respond more quickly to technological changes  finance acquisitions  and fund internal growth 
some of our competitors also have a significantly broader geographic presence than we do 
our engagements may result in professional liability our services typically involve difficult analytical assignments and carry risks of professional and other liability 
many of our engagements involve matters that could have a severe impact on the client s business  cause the client to lose significant amounts of money  or prevent the client from pursuing desirable business opportunities 
accordingly  if a client is dissatisfied with our performance  the client could threaten or bring litigation in order to recover damages or to contest its obligation to pay our fees 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or otherwise breached our obligations to the client could expose us to significant liabilities and tarnish our reputation 
the price of our common stock may be volatile our stock price has been volatile 
from november  to november   the trading price of our common stock ranged from to 
many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  including variations in our quarterly results of operations  the hiring or departure of key personnel or outside experts  changes in our professional reputation  the introduction of new services by us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors  changes in accounting principles  changes in the legal and regulatory environment affecting clients  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts  future sales of shares of common stock in the public market  and market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company 
any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the time and attention of our management and other resources  or otherwise harm our business 
our charter and by laws and massachusetts law may deter takeovers our articles of organization and by laws and massachusetts law contain provisions that could have anti takeover effects and that could discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive 
these provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions  including the election of directors 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of november   we were exposed to market risks  which primarily include changes in us interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain a portion of our investments in financial instruments with purchased maturities of one year or less and a portion of our investments in financial instruments with purchased maturities of two years or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because these financial instruments are readily marketable  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange agreements to hedge our exposure  but we may do so in the future
