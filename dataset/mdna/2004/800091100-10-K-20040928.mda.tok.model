results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal consolidated results 
for the year ended june   the company s net operating revenues increased from million to million  or  from the year ended june  without the two month results of rail city  which was acquired may   net revenues would have increased from million in fiscal to million  or  in fiscal the sands net operating revenues were million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
the sands benefited from an usually strong winter and early spring  which is typically a very slow season 
gold ranch had net operating revenues of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
this increase resulted from higher gasoline prices at the high volume fuel and convenience store 
rail city s net revenues were million for two months of operations 
our consolidated income from operations was million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  income from operations for the sands was just under million in fiscal as compared to over million in fiscal the sands had a net operating revenue increase  but slightly lower income from operations due mainly to increased marketing expense designed to counter the effects of the retrac project and the new thunder valley casino in nearby rocklin  california see risks related to our business later in this discussion 
gold ranch s income from operations decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  lower primarily due to a  charge for impairment of its gasoline pumps 
rail city had income from operations of million in its first two months of operations under the company 
finally  corporate costs of the parent company amounted to  larger than the  operating expenses of the prior year  due to an allocation of corporate salaries and bonus expense precipitated by the purchase of rail city 
consolidated net income was million  or per share diluted for the year ended june  compared to million  or 
per share 
diluted for the year ended june  the large improvement in fiscal net income was due primarily to two events 
first  the company received payments of million on a previously fully reserved note receivable the company possessed in connection with its december sale of the copa casino see gain on previously reserved note receivable in this discussion  and secondly  rail city contributed  to net income in its first two months of operations 
without these two events  the company would have had net income of million  or

the sands net revenues increased  from million for fiscal to million in fiscal  as the downtown reno property benefited from the men s american bowlers congress triennial tournament  which was a month longer and drew larger numbers to the reno area than last year s women s invitational bowlers congress triennial tournament 
further  former patrons of the closed sundowner casino  situated adjacent to the sands  provided the sands with incremental guest counts 
factors moderating the downtown reno property s revenues included the intermittent street disruptions caused by ongoing work on the downtown railroad trench retrac project  high fuel prices  and increased competition from native american casinos  especially from the nearby thunder valley casino in rocklin  california  which opened in may gaming revenues for the sands increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gaming revenues for fiscal tracked lower to the prior year through approximately november  primarily attributable to a soft fiscal first quarter  which was weakened by i street closures from the retrac project and ii less patronage from by the northern california feeder market who gave trial to the newly opened thunder valley casino 
in the march quarter  which was unusually strong in what is typically a seasonally slow period  the gaming revenues turned higher on the year over year comparison and remained higher  finishing higher than the prior year by  or 
the increase in gaming revenues was partially offset by lost revenues from our keno operations  which was outsourced to a third party on may   and now realizes only a small percentage of total keno revenues  but also experiences reduced costs 
lodging revenues for the sands increased for the year ended june   to million from million for fiscal the sands average room rate was for fiscal versus for fiscal  which contributed approximately  to the increase in lodging revenues 
however  the primary reason for the lodging revenue increase was an additional  or  more rooms sold in the fiscal year than in fiscal the sands benefited from less rooms available in the market  as two downtown hotels  the comstock and the sundowner  were closed most of the year  both currently being remodeled into condominiums 
despite an increase in net revenues at the sands  income from operations decreased  or  from fiscal to fiscal  due to a variety of factors  including increased marketing costs to combat the negative effects of both the retrac project and the new competition from california casinos 
further  the wholesale prices for meat used in the restaurants was markedly higher  the nevada legislature enacted new taxes which increased operating costs over  and finally  depreciation costs were higher due to the first full year of amortization of two large projects completed in fiscal i the hotel guest rooms remodel and ii the slot machine player tracking system upgrade

for the year ended june   gold ranch had net revenues of million  compared to million for the year ended june  this increase was attributable primarily to gasoline revenue and in particular an increase in the price of gasoline 
the average retail price of a gallon of gasoline was for fiscal compared to for fiscal gasoline gallons sold declined by  or  due in part to slightly less traffic on interstate during the fiscal year 
additionally  during the last half of the fiscal year  gold ranch experienced some competitive gasoline pricing on the i corridor in california 
at times  gold ranch wasn t able to sell gasoline as cheaply as its california competitors and maintain its margins 
gaming revenue for gold ranch is comprised of slot machine revenue and  to a lesser degree  revenue from a california lottery ticket station 
gaming revenue increased from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  management believes the substantially flat results were due  in part  to the decrease in the number of customers drawn by inexpensive gasoline and to competition from casinos in northern california 
further  gaming revenues were negatively impacted by a lower than theoretical hold percentage on its slot machines 
hold percentage is the percentage the house wins  which is compared to total dollars played 
management believes the excessively low hold problem of its slot machines was due to an isolated incident and has taken corrective action 
gold ranch s income from operations for the year ended june  declined from the year ended june  by  or 
the primary reason for the decline was a non cash charge of  taken on its gasoline pumps 
further  management believes that the intermittently malfunctioning pumps may have contributed to the gallons sold shortfall 
other items contributing to gold ranch s decrease in income from operations include higher meat prices in its restaurant  new taxes enacted by the nevada legislature  which among other things  increased the nevada tax on cigarettes and negatively impacted convenience store volume and gross margins

table of contents corporate costs 
corporate costs of the parent company  including public company reporting and related legal and accounting fees  were  in the year ended june   compared to  in the year ended june  the  increase was due to some senior management bonuses at the parent company 
for the fiscal year ended june   the total amount of management bonuses absorbed by the parent company was approximately  as compared to no bonuses allocated to the parent company in the prior year 
additionally  director fees increased in by  over the prior year 
conversely  the company actively sought to decrease some of the costs associated with being a public company  which have increased in recent years  and year over year cost reductions were experienced in annual report production costs  directors and officers insurance  and in corporate related legal fees  which  in total  decreased  and partially offset the cost increases 
interest expense 
interest expense was almost million for the year ended june   compared to slightly more than million in the year ended june  the decrease resulted despite our acceleration of the expensing of loan fees from our previous bank debt  which was refinanced in may we realized the amortization of loan fees in our interest expense and those fees were  greater in than the prior year 
throughout fiscal  the company continued its policy to pay down its long term line of credit with any available cash 
this was accelerated by a million settlement we received on a note receivable we held in connection with the december sale of the copa casino 
on may   we increased our bank debt from million to approximately million to fund the rail city acquisition 
see capital resources and liquidity in this section for a more detailed explanation 
loss on abandonment of new projects 
in the year ended june   the company took a  write off of costs we had incurred on an opportunity we are still pursuing  which involves expanding the number of slot machines we have in one of our slot route locations from the current machines to the company maintains the required non restricted state license to turn this operation into a casino  however  in january  the reno city council denied the company s request to expand  resulting in the loss 
we believe the action taken by the council was arbitrary and we have taken taken legal action 
in the year ended june   we abandoned our plans to build a casino in minden  nevada  resulting in a loss of  gain on previously reserved note receivable 
on november   we reached an agreement with gulfside casino partnership d b a the copa casino in gulfport  mississippi  regarding a final settlement of amounts owed to the company pursuant to a non interest bearing promissory note issued to the company in connection with its december sale of its interest in the copa casino 
the terms of the note required a monthly payment to the company in an amount equal to the greater of  or of the copa casino s gross gaming revenues beginning july until the note is paid in full 
at the time of the settlement  the unpaid balance of the note was million 
on november   the company received an approximately million cash payment as final settlement under the note 
the company had not previously recognized a gain on the settlement amount due primarily to the company s uncertainty of the copa s current management s ability to obtain long term financing  as well as competitive  legal  financial  environmental and various other risks facing the casino 
as a result  in december  the company recognized a gain for the full settlement amount of million plus debt service payments of  made during the period 

table of contents federal income tax effective rate 
the company s effective tax rate of varies significantly from the statutory rate due to circumstances involving the company s sale of the copa casino 
at the time of the copa casino s sale  the company s tax basis in the copa casino was million and its financial basis was million 
the sales price included a note for million and  in cash 
the million proceeds from the sale was recognized for tax purposes and a million tax gain was recorded 
no gain was recognized for financial statement purposes 
a deferred tax asset was recognized for million with a related valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance was recorded due to the uncertainty of receiving any future payments in relation to the sale 
in fiscal  payments were received  which reduced the net deferred tax asset to  in fiscal  a payment of was received in a negotiated settlement of the note 
in addition  the remaining million due was written off as bad debt for tax purposes  as this was previously recorded as part of the tax gain in accordingly  the valuation allowance was reversed  the deferred tax asset was utilized  and the overall tax rate was reduced as a result of this transaction 
comparison of fiscal to consolidated results 
for the year ended june   the company s net operating revenues increased from million to million  or  from the year ended june  consolidated income from operations increased from million in the previous year to million in the current year ended june  the company generated a consolidated net income of million  or cents per share cents diluted  for the year ended june   as compared to a consolidated net loss of  or 
per share  for the year ended june  there were four primary reasons for the increase in revenues and consolidated net income of the company during the current fiscal year the acquisition and consolidation of gold ranch operations into the company as of june   the return of a major bowling event to downtown reno after its regularly scheduled one year hiatus  the reopening of the reno sparks convention center after undergoing a significant expansion and remodel  and the steady return of wholesale airline tour operations post the september  terrorist attack 
sands regency hotel and casino 
for the year ended june   the sands had net revenues of million  compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of 
gaming revenues of the sands property accounted for the majority of the net revenue increase  increasing  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal consistent with the gaming industry in general  most of the revenue growth realized was in slot machine revenue  which increased  from million in the year ended june   to million in the year ended june  the sands sold approximately  more hotel rooms in fiscal year as compared to the previous year  an increase of  which generated additional guest counts  a large factor in the gaming revenue increase 
the average daily hotel rate increased from in the year ended june   to in the year ended june   as the sands  and reno in general  benefited from increased demand associated with the four month long women s international bowling congress  and a strong summer of first quarter of fiscal  as reno tourism rebounded from the effects of the september terrorist attack 
income from operations increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  operating margins increased substantially in gaming departments  gaming revenues increased  or  while gaming operating expenses decreased  or  year to year 
gaming operating expense margins at the sands improved from to 
cost savings programs instituted in the current year resulted in a lower cost of complimentary rooms  food  beverage  and merchandise given to casino customers 
additionally  new slot machine related technology purchased in december has proven to be less labor intensive and has allowed for a reduction in labor hours in the slot department

the company acquired gold ranch in june  as such  it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from prior year comparisons for revenues  expenses  and operating margins 
further  one month s revenues can not be annualized to help draw comparisons because of seasonality factors 
in general  good weather means more travelers on interstate and higher revenues for the gold ranch 
however  gold ranch and reno area promotions and special events  the timing of holiday weekends  the size of the california lottery jackpot  and the price of gasoline can all significantly impact gold ranch customer counts 
total net revenues for gold ranch were million for the year ended june   as compared with net revenues of million in the one month of operation in the year ended june  the highest revenue component at the gold ranch property is the high volume arco gas station and convenience store 
the gas station and convenience store contributed million to gold ranch s net revenue for the year ended june   as compared to million for the one month ended june  a change in the price of gasoline can greatly influence total revenues but have a minimal impact on profitability 
the next highest net revenue component  slot machines  accounted for million of the total net revenues in the year ended june   as compared to  in the one month ended june  beginning with the quarter ended september   the company s first full quarter of operation  slot machine volume  as measured by cash and coin dropped in slot machines was    and million  sequentially by quarter  which approximates anticipated seasonality at the verdi  nevada property 
operating costs for gold ranch for the year ended june   were million  compared to million for the one month ended june  income from operations for the fiscal year was million  which compares to the income from operations of  for the one month ended june

corporate costs 
corporate costs  including public company reporting and related legal and accounting fees  were  in the year ended june  this was higher than the  of corporate costs in the year ended june   primarily due to incremental costs associated with the acquisition of gold ranch and to additional costs associated with new public company disclosure requirements 
interest income and expense 
effective june   the company s principal long term debt instrument was in the form of a revolving line of credit 
rather than draw interest income on its excess operating cash  the company found it beneficial to reduce interest expense in fiscal by making voluntary principal payments to its line of credit 
as a result  interest income decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal however  interest expense decreased from million in the year ended june   to million in the year ended june   despite the company carrying a higher average debt load during fiscal the company carried an average debt load of approximately million in fiscal the balance of long term debt at the beginning of fiscal was million  throughout the fiscal year the company made principal payments of million  and by june   the company s long term debt balance was million 
the effective interest rate of the company s long term debt prior to the june  gold ranch acquisition was  and throughout fiscal  it was approximately 
insurance settlement lawsuit 
in the year ended june   the company incurred legal and settlement costs aggregating  in connection with the settlement of a personal injury claim 
the company from time to time incurs legal costs and settlements charges in its normal course of business  however the company maintains general liability insurance to protect itself from costs exceeding the contracted deductible 
this claim was insured  but the insurance carrier  legion indemnity  is insolvent and not expected to make any payment to the 
table of contents company 
the company is seeking recovery of its loss from the company s insurance broker 
any recovery will be realized and recorded when received 
other potential liabilities emanating from the same two year period the company was insured by legion indemnity have been identified and the company feels have been sufficiently reserved for 
the statute of limitations has expired for additional claims arising out of this period 
loss on disposition of assets project abandonments 
the company had losses on disposition of assets of  in the year ended june   compared with losses of  in the year ended june  in fiscal the company s losses on disposition of assets were due to the completion of the hotel room remodel project 
during the year ended june   losses primarily stemmed from the disposition of slot machines and related hardware and software  and the write down of a prospective new venture in minden  nevada  a project no longer actively being pursued 
gain on previously reserved note receivable 
during the year ended june   the company received  in payments pursuant to a non interest bearing promissory note issued to the company in connection with its december sale of its interest in the copa casino 
the company recognized a gain for  of the payment amount because it had not previously done so  due to the company s uncertainty of the copa s current management s ability to obtain long term financing  as well as competitive  legal  financial  environmental and various other risks facing the casino 
subsequently  in the year ended june   the company realized an additional gain for million and the note has been settled in full see note 
seasonality as is true for most casinos in the reno area  especially for casinos with lodging  tourism declines rather substantially in the winter 
due to lower room rates and a lower level of gaming play per occupied room  operating margins and  to a lesser extent  revenues are lower during our second and third fiscal quarters 
to attempt to counter this seasonality  the company has aggressively pursued local patrons for the last several years 
in may  the company acquired rail city  a locals casino  which historically experiences above average demand during the winter months 
despite this acquisition  management anticipates that the trend of experiencing lower operating margins and revenues in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year may diminish somewhat  but will continue 
capital resources and liquidity the company s cash and cash equivalents increased from million at june  to million at june  the increase results from the cash requirements necessary to operate a new casino 
the company keeps operating cash only on hand  excess cash is used to pay down its line of credit 
we had negative working capital of million as of june   compared to working capital of million as of june  this resulted from our aggressive pay down policy on our line of credit 
at june   the company had million of credit lines available 
cash flow from operations provided million during the year ended june   compared to million for the prior year 
a substantial portion of the increase resulted from a million change in the company s income tax position  which was a net receivable of  on june  and is a payable of  on june  investing activities accounted for a total of million of net cash outflows for the year ended june   compared to net cash outflows of million in the prior year 
net cash paid in the rail city acquisition was million 
additionally  we invested million in annual capital expenditures  higher than the million invested last year  but less than the million expended in fiscal year ended june  cash inflows of million from the settlement of a note receivable  partially offset the cash used to acquire rail city and used on capital expenditures 

table of contents financing activities provided million of net cash inflows during the year ended june   compared to million of net cash outflows in the prior year 
the bank debt of million at july   was repaid in full with the final million refinanced in conjunction with the may  rail city acquisition 
subordinated debt of million  from the company s may acquisition of gold ranch casino and rv resort  was retired 
this retirement was refinanced in march by a three part debt and equity transaction with a private investor that consisted of i million of equity raised by issuing  shares of common stock for per share  ii a secured convertible note in the amount of million  with a conversion price of  which is convertible into  shares of common stock  and iii a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  at an exercise price of per share 
additionally  the company paid million in costs to obtain the new bank and private investor debt financing 
at june   the company believes that its cash funds  cash generated from operations  and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund its operations  meet current debt obligations  and fulfill its capital expenditure obligations for the foreseeable future  however  the company s operations are subject to financial  economic  competitive  regulatory  and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow  it could be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity capital

our business may be adversely impacted if the reno economy declines 
we heavily market to and rely upon business from reno area residents 
in recent years  reno has enjoyed robust business growth and has attracted a number of technology  product distribution and marketing companies 
these businesses have created jobs and helped fuel residential development  including the reno metropolitan area 
should there be negative changes in the business and job conditions in reno  our locals business  which is a substantial part of our overall business  could be adversely impacted

acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies 
if we are not able to successfully integrate rail city  we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisition was intended to create  which may adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and the market price of our stock

charges that we may incur in connection with acquisition could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 

table of contents the gaming industry is highly competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is highly competitive 
as competitive pressures from california native american casinos increase  other reno area casinos may intensify their targeting of the reno area resident market  which is one of our key markets 
increased competitive pressures in the local market could adversely impact our ability to continue to attract local residents to our facilities  or require us to use more expensive and therefore less profitable promotions to compete more efficiently 
in addition  native american gaming facilities in california and other jurisdictions in some instances operate under regulatory requirements less stringent than those imposed on nevada licensed casinos  which could afford them a competitive advantage in our markets 
our business may be adversely impacted by expanded native american gaming operations in california and the pacific northwest 
our largest sources of tourist customers are california and the pacific northwest  including a large number who drive to reno from the san francisco and sacramento metropolitan areas 
the expansion of native american casinos in california  oregon  and washington continues to have an impact on casino revenues in nevada in general  and some analysts have predicted the impact will be significant on the reno tahoe market 
for example  thunder valley casino  a large new native american casino managed by station casinos  inc  opened june   miles west of reno in rocklin  california 
california s well documented budgetary problems have state officials in active negotiations to renegotiate certain compacts with native american tribes 
some native american casino compacts have already been changed to allow for additional slot machines 
further  there are at least two initiatives on california s november ballot  the passage of which  would serve to increase the number of slots in that state 
the effect of increased gaming in california and other states is difficult to predict 
however  our business would be adversely impacted if thunder valley and other casinos attract patrons who would otherwise travel to reno 
in addition  a significant portion of our customer base is made up of reno area residents 
if other reno area casinos lose business due to competition from native american casinos  they may intensify their marketing efforts to reno area residents as well  which could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 
adverse winter weather conditions in the sierra nevada mountains and reno lake tahoe area could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse winter weather conditions  particularly snowfall  can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to frequent our facilities 
adverse winter weather would most significantly affect our drive in customers from northern california and the pacific northwest 
if the reno area itself were to experience prolonged adverse winter weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected 
terrorist attacks may seriously harm our business 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that created economic and business uncertainties  especially for the travel and tourism industry 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses  and other acts of war or hostility have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition in ways we currently cannot predict 
if we lose our key personnel  our business could be materially adversely affected we depend on the continued performance of our chief executive officer and his management team 
if we lose the services of our senior management personnel  and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the state of nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us 
the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  or revoke or decline to renew a license for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us and we could be forced to forfeit a portion of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets would have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the state of nevada or the city of reno increases gaming taxes and fees  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
in addition  worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
if the state of nevada  the cities of reno or sparks  or the county of washoe were to increase gaming taxes and fees  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our operations continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing downtown reno railroad trench project 
work began in the fall of on a project to build a trench through downtown reno for the purpose of constructing a below grade rail transport corridor 
large scale excavation is currently underway 
known as retrac reno transportation railroad access corridor  the project is anticipated to be completed by late currently  union pacific s railroad tracks dissect downtown reno  as well as the sands parking facilities 
retrac has adversely affected the utility of nearly of the sands parking spaces to build an interim railroad track known as the shoo fly 
the company has also been informed that a small number of parking spaces and sands pedestrian overpass structure will be permanently lost 
the law requires that the sands be given alternate parking or compensation for spaces and structures permanently or temporarily lost due to the project 
in july  the sands received compensation amounting to approximately  for its contribution to the project 
the company is amortizing  of the proceeds over the anticipated length of the project may through november 
part of the proceeds   represents land  specifically parking spaces  that were effectively sold to the city of reno 
the company feels it was not adequately compensated for its contribution to the project and filed a lawsuit in january negotiations are continuing for a replacement bridge and additional parking  and as of the date of this report  the company is in active negotiations with retrac  and reviewing its alternatives 
the effect of trench construction on downtown reno s business levels  and specifically the business levels of the sands  is hard to quantify  as any potential downside due to customer inconvenience could be somewhat offset by opportunities  such as the effect this major construction project will have on the reno area economy 
in light of these uncertainties  the company feels this project could still have an adverse material impact on the business levels of its downtown reno property during the construction period 
recently issued standards  rules and regulations of governing agencies and bodies could result in material increases our corporate expense which could adversely affect our financial results 
we keep abreast of new generally acceptable accounting principles and rules and regulations issued or adopted by the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  the nasdaq and other standard setting agencies 
these principles  rules and regulations often require us to expend funds in order to meet additional requirements 
as a result  our expenses could materially increase  which could adversely affect our 
table of contents financial results 
recently issued accounting standards affecting our financial results are described in note to our financial statements 
our substantial indebtedness after the rail city acquisition could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
on may   the company acquired rail city casino in sparks  nevada 
the major considerations given as to why rail city was a good acquisition for the company include  but not limited to customer deversification and property expansion potential  management and marketing efficiencies of having a third casino in close proximity to others  an inherent market niche that compliments the company s previous customer base  and a proven industry performer with an efficient cost structure 
the future success of the company s acquisition of rail city will depend on a number of factors  including the successful integration of the operations of rail city 
the difficulties of combining the operations of rail city with that of the company include  among others retaining key employees  consolidating administrative infrastructures  coordinating sales and marketing functions  and minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns 
in addition  even if the company is able to integrate rail city s operations successfully  this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits and growth opportunities that we expect or these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
our outstanding debt as of december  was approximately million 
after the rail city acquisition  our debt increased to in excess of million 
as a result of this increase in debt  demands on our cash resources will increase 
the increased levels of debt could  among other things require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  acquisitions and other purposes  increase our vulnerability to  and limit flexibility in planning for  adverse economic and industry conditions  create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels  and limit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the repayment of debt 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk with the credit agreement executed in april in connection with the acquisition of rail city  the company has substantial variable interest rate debt in the amount of million 
assuming the credit facilities are fully advanced  the company is subject to substantial market interest rate risks 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  annually 
additionally  terms of the company s rv park management agreement with prospector gaming enterprises pge  referenced as in the commitments and contingencies section of this report  state that the company pay monthly an amount equal to of pge s debt service on the underlying rv park note  which varies directly with changes in the prime index 
the financial impact to the company of a full one percent increase in the prime index is less than  per year 
the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
