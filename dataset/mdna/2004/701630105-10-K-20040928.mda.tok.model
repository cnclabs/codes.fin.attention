see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements on page of this annual report on form k 
overview we believe we are a leading supplier of flexible interconnects principally for sale to the automotive  telecommunications and networking  diversified electronics  military  home appliance  electronic identification medical and computer markets 
we believe that our development of innovative materials and processes provides us with a competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete 
during the past three years  we have invested approximately million in property and equipment and approximately million in research and development to develop materials and enhance our manufacturing processes 
we believe that these expenditures will help us to meet customer demand for our products  and enable us to continue to be a technological leader in the flexible interconnect industry 
our research and development expenses are included in our cost of products sold 
over the past three years  we were adversely affected by the economic downturn and its impact on our key customers and markets 
in we experienced sales growth in several strategic markets  particularly in the second half of the year 
growth in the medical  appliance and military markets has helped to reduce domestic losses 
significant investment over the past three years has positioned us to capitalize on a rapidly expanding china electronic manufacturing industry 
in our china operations revenues increased by over with significant improvement in profitability 
over the last three years we incurred operating losses of million and have used cash to fund operations and working capital of million 
we have taken certain steps to improve operating margins  including the closure of facilities  downsizing of our north american employee base  and transfer of our manufacturing operations to lower cost locations  such as the people s republic of china 
in addition  we have worked closely with our lenders to manage through this difficult time and have obtained additional capital in and through sale leasebacks of selected corporate assets  the issuance of convertible debt and preferred stock and the execution of new working capital borrowing agreements 
as a result of the difficult economic environment  we have had difficulty maintaining compliance with the terms and conditions of certain of our financing facilities in prior years and throughout at june   however  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
based upon our recent improvement in financial performance  we are currently  and expect to remain  in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
we have million in existing short term debt  associated with our chinese operations  that will be refinanced or repaid in we believe that we will be able to obtain the necessary refinancing of this debt because of our history of successfully refinancing our short term chinese borrowings and our rapidly improving chinese operating results 
in fiscal  revenues from our chinese operations grew 
we expect similar revenue growth and improved profitability in china during fiscal failure to obtain such financing may have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we formed a chinese joint venture  parlex shanghai circuit co  ltd parlex shanghai  in to better serve our customers that have production facilities in asia and to more cost effectively manufacture products for worldwide distribution 
effective october   we purchased the share of parlex shanghai held by one of our joint venture partners  increasing our equity interest in parlex shanghai to 
parlex shanghai s results of operations  cash flows and financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in we completed the transfer of the production of our automotive related products utilizing our palflex r technology from our methuen  massachusetts facility to parlex interconnect  a wholly owned subsidiary of parlex asia pacific limited parlex asia  which is located in china 
the transfer of this technology and manufacturing capability was critical to exiting a very unprofitable north american manufacturing business 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
we believe the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  included in item of this form k and in part iv  item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  valuation of stock options and warrants  income taxes and other accrued expenses  including self insured health insurance claims 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in applying our accounting policies  our management uses its best judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
actual results would differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product  at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time title to the product passes to the customer 
title passes to the customer according to the shipping terms negotiated between the customer and us 
license fees and royalty income are recognized when earned 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with sfas no 
and of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
we value our raw material inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
work in process and finished goods are valued as a percentage of completed cost  not in excess of net realizable value 
we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand and  as such  our estimate of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory will change  which we will record in the period such determination was made 
raw material  work in process and finished goods inventory associated with programs cancelled by customers are fully reserved for as obsolete 
reductions in obsolescence reserves are recognized when realized through disposal of reserved items  either through sale or scrapping 
goodwill 
we recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of a interest in parlex shanghai and our acquisition of parlex dynaflex corporation dynaflex 
we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 if an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life  it shall not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
an intangible asset that is not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment  for each reporting unit  on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
in accordance with the guidelines in sfas no 
 we determined we have one reporting unit 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing our market capitalization  as adjusted for a control premium  to our recorded net asset value 
if our market capitalization  as adjusted for a control premium  is less than our recorded net asset value  we will further evaluate the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill  as required by sfas no 
 and we will record an impairment charge against the goodwill  if required  in our results of operations in the period such determination was made 
since our market capitalization  as adjusted  exceeded our recorded net asset value upon adoption of sfas no 
and at the subsequent annual impairment analysis dates  we have concluded that no impairment adjustments were required at the time of adoption or at the annual impairment analysis date 
the carrying value of the goodwill was  at june  and income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our net deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that we have adequately considered such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources  except as may be set forth below under liquidity and capital resources 
our obligations under operating leases are disclosed in the notes to our financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected items in our statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue 
you should read the table and the discussion below in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

total revenues for were million  an increase of from million in revenues from our china operations were approximately million  an increase of over the prior year 
strong growth occurred in the computer and peripherals  automotive  telecommunications and electronic identification markets 
during we significantly expanded our china value added assembly operations which included the transfer of our domestic high volume automated surface mount capability to our kunshan facility in may polymer thick film revenue increased from million in to million in revenues from the appliance market  representing of total revenues in  continued to be strong  largely driven by laundry equipment product sales 
initial qualification was completed on two new product opportunities range and laundry equipment during the fourth quarter of most significant increases occurred in the medical market  primarily in disposable medical devices 
proprietary technologies including silver based conductive inks and gels have generated significant new product opportunities including disposable blood glucose monitors and sensors to detect carpal tunnel syndrome 
worldwide  medical revenues grew to million in from million in in addition to the importance to our market diversification strategy  growth in medical revenues is important to domestic and european facility utilization 
laminated cable revenues were flat year over year but increased by in the second half of the year compared to the first half of  indicative of a strengthening north american electronics market 
total revenues included licensing and royalty fees of approximately  for and  for although we intend to continue developing materials and processes that we can license to third parties  we do not expect that licensing and royalty revenues will represent a significant portion of total revenues in the near term 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold was million  or of total revenues  for  versus million  or of total revenues for revenue increases  of million  in china and our polymer thick film operations were responsible for gross margin increases of million in compared to million in  or a year over year increase in gross margin of 
china s gross margins were adversely impacted by start up costs associated with the initial production ramp of our new smartcard manufacturing line 
smartcard revenues and cost of goods sold were million and million respectively  in initial production of smartcards commenced in october breakeven production volumes of our smartcard business were achieved in june margins improved from to in our laminated cable operations 
material cost reduction efforts coupled with increased utilization of lower cost mexico assembly and finishing capabilities contributed to improved gross margins 
in  gross margins were significantly adversely impacted by shutdown costs associated with the closing of our domestic palflex operations 
in  we recorded million in costs of products sold from our palflex operations on million in revenue 
operations of our us palflex business ceased in february the methuen multilayer operation continued to experience low capacity utilization and  correspondingly  significant unfavorable manufacturing variances 
revenue in the multilayer operation was severely impacted by the rapid decline in telecommunications network infrastructure market 
in fiscal this market represented over of multilayer revenues 
in  revenues in this market were immaterial 
over the past two years we have sought to replace this revenue by targeting markets demanding complex north american design and manufacturing solutions 
we believe the military aerospace and medical markets represent two growing markets demanding such services 
in addition to a focused corporate sales effort targeting new business development  we have continued to evaluate opportunities to acquire business  particularly in the highly fragmented military aerospace market 
in june  we completed a strategic sourcing agreement with delphi corporation 
under the arrangement delphi will transfer production of its multilayer flexible circuit manufacturing to our methuen operation 
we expect this will significantly improve facility utilization and further reduce operating losses in the us selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for the comparable period in the prior year 
increases occurred in the following areas commissions  primarily due to volume  headcount for direct sales and china infra structure  insurance and public company costs  and bad debt reserves associated with a customer dispute interest income

income taxes 
our effective tax rate benefit was approximately in compared to an effective tax rate of in our effective tax rate is impacted by the proportion of our estimated annual income being earned in domestic versus foreign tax jurisdictions  the generation of tax credits and the recording of any valuation allowance 
as a result of our history of operating losses and uncertain future operating results  we determined that it is more likely than not that certain historic and current year income tax benefits would not be realized 
consequently  in we increased our valuation allowance by million resulting in an effective tax rate of 
in  we realized and recognized  of state and federal tax refunds  recognized  of federal refunds and recorded a  state and foreign tax provision resulting in a net tax rate benefit of fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  total revenues 
total revenues for were million  a decrease of from million in in february  we closed our domestic palflex operations in methuen  massachusetts 
palflex is a proprietary adhesiveless double sided copper flexible circuit roll to roll manufacturing process 
revenues generated from our palflex operations in were million versus million in excluding palflex revenues from both years  total revenues grew by 
decreases in our multi layer million and laminated cable million operations were offset by strong growth in our polymer thick film million and china million operations 
in  we continued to emphasize a strategy of market diversification 
our major markets  which represent growth from the prior year  include the home appliance market with whirlpool and maytag as our largest customers  the military market with raytheon  bae and general dynamics and the computer market with strong growth from hewlett packard 
reductions in revenues occurred primarily in the automotive market driven by the closing of our domestic palflex operations 
total revenues included licensing and royalty fees of approximately  for and  for although we intend to continue developing materials and processes that we can license to third parties  we do not expect that licensing and royalty revenues will represent a significant portion of total revenues in the near term 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold was million  or of total revenues  for  versus million  or of total revenues for in  cost of products sold was adversely impacted by the cost of closing the domestic palflex operation 
in  we recorded million in costs of products sold from our palflex operations on million in revenue 
in addition to operating significantly under capacity and therefore absorbing high fixed costs  we recorded severance costs for people terminated in march and capital and inventory write downs 
in addition  the methuen operation continued to experience low capacity utilization and  correspondingly  significant unfavorable manufacturing variances 
in  these variances totaled approximately million and have been charged to cost of products sold 
to improve utilization in  we relocated our salem  new hampshire laminated cable business to methuen 
relocation costs of approximately  were expensed as incurred in the first half of the year 
the move was completed in january during the past year  we have made a significant investment to improve our margins through the transfer of labor intensive manufacturing operations in the united states to more cost effective locations 
a large portion of the final assembly  inspection  and test procedures previously performed in our methuen  massachusetts and salem  new hampshire facilities are now performed in mexico 
during  we completed the transfer of our palflex operations to china 
the transfer of manufacturing capabilities is costly  however this investment is core to our long term strategy for cost effective manufacturing 
although these cost reduction measures are expected to improve our gross margins  a return to profitability is predicated upon operational performance  a favorable product mix and increased sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for the comparable period in the prior year 
due to the reorganization of our sales force in mid and the staffing of several open regional positions  selling expenses increased  in the increase in selling expenses was partially offset by a  decrease in administrative expenses 
interest income

the increase in interest expense in is due to higher average borrowing levels and to the interest associated with the sale leaseback of the methuen facility 
non operating income 
non operating income was  in and  in non operating income in represents currency exchange rate gains 
non operating expense 
non operating expense was  in and  in non operating expense primarily represents currency exchange rate losses

our effective tax rate was approximately in compared to an effective tax rate benefit of in our effective tax rate is impacted by the proportion of our estimated annual income being earned in domestic versus foreign tax jurisdictions  the generation of tax credits and the recording of any valuation allowance 
as a result of our recent history of operating losses  uncertain future operating results  and the non compliance with certain of our debt covenants requirements  which has subsequently been waived  we determined that it is more likely than not that certain historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized 
consequently  we increased our valuation allowance by million in liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
net cash used by operations during was million 
net losses of million after adjustment for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  facility exit cost  interest payable in common stock  gain on sale of land use rights and minority interest  used million of operating cash

in december  one of the note holders of our convertible debt exercised of their warrants to purchase parlex common stock at per share 
we received proceeds totaling  upon exercise of the warrants and issued  shares of parlex common stock 
in  we received  from the methuen sale leaseback note receivable of which  was interest payments and  was principal 
we expect to continue to receive interest payments on our methuen sale leaseback note  but do not expect any additional principal payments before june  improved financial performance in the fourth quarter significantly reduced operating losses and cash used in operations 
increased sales in the fourth quarter of  however  have placed additional cash demands on working capital with growth in account receivables 
the strong credit ratings of our large oem and ems customer base has allowed us to successfully finance this growth through asset based working capital lines of credit 
we recently completed stand alone financing for our china operations through a new line of credit with bank of china which will allow us to continue financing our growth plans

as of june   we were in compliance with our financial covenants 
at june   we had available borrowing capacity under the loan agreement of approximately million 
since the available borrowing capacity exceeded  at june   none of our cash balance was subject to restriction at june  the loan agreement includes both a subjective acceleration clause and a lockbox arrangement that requires all lockbox receipts to be used to pay down the revolving credit borrowings 
accordingly  borrowings under the loan agreement have been classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of june  as required by emerging issues task force issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lockbox arrangement 
however  such borrowings will be excluded from current liabilities in future periods and considered long term obligations if such borrowing are refinanced on a long term basis  the subjective acceleration terms of the loan agreement are modified  or will not require the use of working capital within one year 
at june   the balance outstanding under the loan agreement was properly classified as long term debt as a result of the refinancing of such debt on a long term basis with the proceeds of the convertible notes

finance obligation on sale leaseback of methuen facility in june  we sold our methuen facility for a purchase price of  which consisted of  in cash at the closing  a promissory note in the amount of  the note and up to  in additional cash under the terms of an earn out clause 
in june  we received  reducing the principal balance of the promissory note to  under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  we simultaneously entered into a lease agreement relating to the methuen facility with a minimum lease term of years 
as the repurchase option contained in the lease and the receipt of the note from the buyer provide us with a continuing involvement in the methuen facility  we have accounted for the sale leaseback of the methuen facility as a financing transaction 
accordingly  we continue to report the methuen facility as an asset and continue to record depreciation expense 
we record all cash received under the transaction as a finance obligation 
the note and related interest thereon  and the  in additional cash under the terms of an earn out clause will be recorded as an increase to the finance obligation as cash payments are received 
we record the principal portion of the monthly lease payments as a reduction to the finance obligation and the interest portion of the monthly lease payments is recorded as interest expense 
the closing costs for the transaction have been capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense over the initial year lease term 
upon expiration of the repurchase option june   we will reevaluate our accounting to determine whether a gain or loss should be recorded on this sale leaseback transaction 
convertible subordinated notes on july   we sold an aggregate  of our convertible subordinated notes the notes with attached warrants to several institutional investors 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the transaction  after deducting approximately  in finders fees and other transaction expenses 
net proceeds were used to pay down amounts borrowed under our loan agreement and utilized for working capital needs 
no principal payments are due until maturity on july  the notes are unsecured 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of  payable quarterly in shares of our common stock 
the number of shares of common stock to be issued is calculated by dividing the accrued quarterly interest by a conversion price  which was initially established at per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits  dividends and certain combinations 
interest expense is recorded quarterly based on the fair value of the common shares issued 
accordingly  interest expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we have concluded that the interest feature does not constitute an embedded derivative as it does not currently meet the criteria for classification as a derivative 
we recorded accrued interest payable on the notes of  within stockholders equity at june   as the interest is required to be paid quarterly in the form of common stock 
based on the conversion price of per common share at june   we issued a total of  shares of common stock in october  january and april in satisfaction of previously recorded interest 
we also issued  shares of common stock in july as payment for the interest accrued in the fourth quarter 
the notes contained a beneficial conversion feature reflecting an effective initial conversion price that was less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on july  the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature was approximately  which has been recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital and as an original issue discount on the notes which is being amortized to interest expense over the year life of the notes 
after two years from the date of issuance  we have the right to redeem all  but not less than all  of the notes at of the remaining principal of notes then outstanding  plus all accrued and unpaid interest  under certain conditions 
after three years from the date of issuance  the holder of any of the notes may require us to redeem the notes in whole  but not in part 
such redemption shall be at of the remaining principal of such notes  plus all accrued and unpaid interest 
in the event of a change in control as defined therein  the holder has the option to require that the notes be redeemed in whole but not in part  at of the outstanding unpaid principal amount  plus all unpaid interest accrued 
payments due under contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at june   adjusted to include the cash commitments associated with the convertible subordinated notes  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations   capital lease obligations  including methuen facility finance obligation      operating leases  including poly flex facility      deferred compensation     convertible sub ordinated notes   total      in response to the worldwide downturn in the electronics industry  we have taken a series of actions to reduce operating expenses and to restructure operations  consisting primarily of reductions in workforce and consolidation of manufacturing operations 
during  we transferred our high volume automated surface mount assembly line from our cranston  rhode island facility to china 
in august  we announced a new strategic relationship with delphi corporation to supply all multilayer flex and rigid flex circuits which were previously manufactured by delphi in its irvine  california facility 
we continue to implement plans to control operating expenses  inventory levels  and capital expenditures as well as manage accounts payable and accounts receivable to enhance cash flow and return us to profitability 
our plans include the following actions continuing to consolidate manufacturing facilities  continuing to transfer certain manufacturing processes from our domestic operations to lower cost international manufacturing locations  primarily those in the people s republic of china  expanding our products in the home appliance  laptop computer  medical  military and aerospace  and electronic identification markets  continuing to monitor general and administrative expenses  and continuing to evaluate opportunities to improve capacity utilization by either acquiring multilayer flexible circuit businesses or entering into strategic relationships for their production 
in and  we entered into a series of alternative financing arrangements to partially replace or supplement those currently in place in order to provide us with financing to support our current working capital needs 
working capital requirements  particularly those to support the growth in our china operations  consumed million of a total of million of cash used in operations during in september  we secured a new million asset based working capital agreement with the bank of china which provides stand alone financing for our china operations 
in addition  in may we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our series a convertible preferred stock 
we continue to evaluate alternative financing opportunities to further improve our liquidity and to fund working capital needs 
we believe that our cash on hand and the cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating obligations through june if we require additional or new external financing to repay or refinance our existing financing obligations or fund our working capital requirements  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing 
failure to obtain such financing may have a material adverse impact on our operations 
at june   we were in compliance  and we expect to remain in compliance  with all of our financial covenants associated with our financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
the requirements of this statement apply to an issuers classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments  including those that comprise more than one option or forward contract 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks 
our future results may differ materially from the current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
if we cannot obtain additional financing when needed  we may experience a material adverse impact on our operations 
we may need to raise additional funds either through borrowings or further equity financing 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms  or at all 
the cash expected to be generated will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating obligations over the next twelve months based on current growth plans 
if we cannot raise the required funds when needed  we may experience a material adverse impact on our operations 
our business has been  and could continue to be  materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
our operating results have been materially adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced electronics industry spending on both a domestic and worldwide basis 
though we have experienced some general market spending improvement during the past quarter  should market conditions not continue to improve  our business  results of operations or financial condition could continue to be materially adversely affected 
we have at times relied upon waivers from our lenders and amendments or modifications to our financing agreements to avoid any acceleration of our debt payments 
in the event that we are not in compliance with our financial covenants in the future  we cannot be certain our lenders will grant us waivers or execute amendments on terms which are satisfactory to us 
if such waivers are not received  our debt is immediately callable 
since entering into our current loan arrangement with our primary lender  silicon valley bank  in june of  we have requested and received several waivers relating to our failure to comply with certain financial covenants under our loan arrangement 
in conjunction with the waivers  we have also executed several modifications of our loan arrangement which have primarily resulted in easing our covenant compliance requirements  but have also increased our costs of borrowing 
although we do not believe silicon valley bank will exercise any right it may have to immediately call our debt if we fail to comply with our financial covenants  we cannot guarantee that they will not do so 
we are currently in compliance with all of our financial covenants  as amended 
the issuance of our shares upon conversion of outstanding convertible notes  conversion of preferred stock and upon exercise of outstanding warrants may cause significant dilution to our stockholders and may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
on july   we completed a private placement of our convertible subordinated notes and accompanying warrants in an aggregate subscription amount of million 
the conversion price of the convertible notes and the exercise price of the warrants is per share 
in addition  on june   we completed a private placement of  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock the preferred stock and accompanying warrants  for per share  or million in the aggregate 
each share of preferred stock may be converted at any time at the option of the holder of the preferred stock for shares of common stock  and the exercise price of the warrants is per share 
for additional information relating to the sale of the convertible subordinated notes and related warrants  please see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters recent sales of unregistered securities convertible subordinated notes and warrants 
for additional information relating to the sale of preferred stock and related warrants  please see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters recent sales of unregistered securities series a preferred stock and warrants 
the issuance of our shares upon conversion of the convertible subordinated notes and or preferred stock  and exercise of the warrants  and their resale by the holders thereof will increase our publicly traded shares 
these re sales could also depress the market price of our common stock 
we will not control whether or when the holders of these securities elect to convert or exercise their securities for common stock 
in addition  the perceived risk of dilution may cause our stockholders to sell their shares  which would contribute to a downward movement in the stock price of our common stock 
moreover  the perceived risk of dilution and the resulting downward pressure on our stock price could encourage investors to engage in short sales of our common stock 
by increasing the number of shares offered for sale  material amounts of short selling could further contribute to progressive price declines in our common stock 
substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of june   we had approximately million of consolidated debt of which million is due within one year 
our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay when due the principal of  interest on  or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness 
approximately of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 
as a result  our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows  including impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratios contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal  including periodic principal amortization payments  which events could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt as a result of cross default provisions  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt  thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets  possibly on unfavorable terms  to meet payment obligations  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 
our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 
our credit agreement imposes restrictions that affect  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  sell assets  create liens  make capital expenditures and investments  merge or consolidate  enter into transactions with affiliates  and otherwise enter into certain transactions outside the ordinary course of business 
our credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and meet certain financial tests 
our ability to continue to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these covenants or restrictions would result in an event of default under our credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of a breach  the lender under our credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable  foreclose on the assets securing our credit agreement and or cease to provide additional revolving loans or letters of credit  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have incurred losses in each of the last three years  and we may continue to incur losses 
we incurred net losses in each of the last three fiscal years 
we had net losses of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year our operations may not be profitable in the future 
if we cannot obtain additional financing when needed  we may not be able to expand our operations and invest adequately in research and development  which could cause us to lose customers and market share 
the development and manufacturing of flexible interconnects is capital intensive 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  expansion of operations and research and development 
we expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth 
we may need to raise additional funds either through borrowings or further equity financing 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise the required funds when needed  we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and may lose revenue and market share 
our operating results fluctuate and may fail to satisfy the expectations of public market analysts and investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect our results to continue to fluctuate in the future 
our results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including the timing and volume of orders from customers  the timing of introductions of and market acceptance of new products  changes in prices of raw materials  variations in production yields and general economic trends 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may not meet or exceed the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our quarterly results depend upon a small number of large orders received in each quarter  so the loss of any single large order could adversely impact quarterly results and cause our stock price to drop 
a substantial portion of our sales in any given quarter depends on obtaining a small number of large orders for products to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which the orders are received 
although we attempt to monitor our customers needs  we often have limited knowledge of the magnitude or timing of future orders 
it is difficult for us to reduce spending on short notice on operating expenses such as fixed manufacturing costs  development costs and ongoing customer service 
as a result  a reduction in orders  or even the loss of a single large order  for products to be shipped in any given quarter could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
this  in turn  could cause our stock price to decline 
because we sell a substantial portion of our products to a limited number of customers  the loss of a significant customer or a substantial reduction in orders by any significant customer would adversely impact our operating results 
historically we have sold a substantial portion of our products to a limited number of customers 
our largest customers based on sales accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal year  of total revenues in fiscal year  and in fiscal year we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our total revenues in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the loss of a significant customer or a substantial reduction in orders by any significant customer would cause our revenues to decline and have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unable to respond effectively to the evolving technological requirements of customers  our products may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and we may lose revenues and market share 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities 
we will need to develop and market products that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the materials and processes that we are currently developing will result in commercially viable technological processes  or that there will be commercial applications for these technologies 
in addition  we may not be able to make the capital investments required to develop  acquire or implement new technologies and equipment that are necessary to remain competitive 
if we fail to keep pace with technological change  our products may become less competitive or obsolete and we may lose customers and revenues 
competing technologies may reduce demand for our products 
flexible circuit and laminated cable interconnects provide electrical connections between components in electrical systems and are used as a platform to support the attachment of electronic devices 
while flexible circuits and laminated cables offer several advantages over competing printed circuit board and ceramic hybrid circuit technologies  our customers may consider changing their designs to use these alternative technologies in future applications 
if our customers switch to alternative technologies  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
it is also possible that the flexible interconnect industry could encounter competition from new technologies in the future that render existing flexible interconnect technology less competitive or obsolete 
we are heavily dependent upon certain target markets for domestic manufacturing 
a slowdown in these markets could have a material impact on domestic capacity utilization resulting in lower sales and gross margins 
we manufacture our products in seven facilities worldwide  including lower cost offshore locations in china 
however  a significant portion of our manufacturing is still performed domestically 
domestic manufacturing may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to lower cost facilities in asia and other locations 
while historically our competitors in these locations have produced less technologically advanced products  they continue to expand their capabilities 
further  we have targeted markets that have historically sought domestic manufacturing  including the military and aerospace markets 
should we be unsuccessful in maintaining our competitive advantage or should certain target markets also move production to lower cost offshore locations  our domestic sales will decline resulting in significant excess capacity and reduced gross margins 
a significant downturn in any of the sectors in which we sell products could result in a revenue shortfall 
we sell our flexible interconnect products principally to the automotive  telecommunications and networking  diversified electronics  military  home appliance  electronic identification and computer markets 
the worldwide electronics industry has seen a substantial downturn since impacting a number of our target markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one sector  a significant further downturn in any of these market sectors could cause a material reduction in our revenues  which could be difficult to replace 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers  and any interruption in our primary sources of supply  or any significant increase in the prices of materials  chemicals or components  would have an adverse effect on our short term operating results 
we purchase the bulk of our raw materials  process chemicals and components from a limited number of outside sources 
in fiscal year  we purchased approximately of our materials from tongxing  a chinese gold plater  and northfield acquisition co  doing business as sheldahl  our two largest suppliers 
we operate under tight manufacturing cycles with a limited inventory of raw materials 
as a result  although there are alternative sources of the materials that we purchase from our existing suppliers  any unanticipated interruption in supply from tongxing or sheldahl  or any significant increase in the prices of materials  chemicals or components  would have an adverse effect on our short term operating results 
the additional expenses and risks related to our existing international operations  as well as any expansion of our global operations  could adversely affect our business 
we own a equity interest in our investment in china  parlex shanghai  which manufactures and sells flexible circuits 
we also operate a facility in mexico for use in the finishing  assembly and testing of flexible circuit and laminated cable products 
we have a facility in the united kingdom where we manufacture polymer thick film flexible circuits and polymer thick film flexible circuits with surface mounted components and intend to introduce production of laminated cable within the next year 
we will continue to explore appropriate expansion opportunities as demand for our products increases 
manufacturing and sales operations outside the united states carry a number of risks inherent in international operations  including imposition of governmental controls  regulatory standards and compulsory licensure requirements  compliance with a wide variety of foreign and us import and export laws  currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in trade restrictions  tariffs and barriers  political and economic instability  longer payment cycles typically associated with foreign sales  difficulties in administering business overseas  foreign labor issues  wars and acts of terrorism  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although these issues have not materially impacted our revenues or operations to date  we cannot guarantee that they will not impact our revenues or operations in the future 
international expansion may require significant management attention  which could negatively affect our business 
we may also incur significant costs to expand our existing international operations or enter new international markets  which could increase operating costs and reduce our profitability we face significant competition  which could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
we face competition worldwide in the flexible interconnect market from a number of foreign and domestic providers  as well as from alternative technologies such as rigid printed circuits 
many of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources 
new competitors could also enter our markets 
our competitors may be able to duplicate our strategies  or they may develop enhancements to  or future generations of  products that could offer price or performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures could also necessitate price reductions  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products priced in other currencies 
we will need to make a continued high level of investment in product research and development  sales and marketing and ongoing customer service and support in order to remain competitive 
we may not have sufficient resources to be able to make these investments 
moreover  we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive position in the flexible interconnect market 
we face risks from fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the us dollar and the cost of currency exchange 
while we transact business predominantly in us dollars  a large portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the chinese renminbi rmb  the basic unit of currency issued by the people s bank of china 
currently  our exposure to risk from foreign exchange is limited due to the fact that the people s republic of china has fixed the exchange rate of the renminbi to the us dollar 
the value of the renminbi is subject to changes in the prc government s policies and depends to an extent on its domestic and international economic and political developments  as well as supply and demand in the local market 
we cannot give any assurance that the renminbi will continue to remain stable against the us dollar and other foreign currencies 
any devaluation of the renminbi may adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  a small portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in euros and the british pound 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect our cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to these risks 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate key personnel  we may not be able to develop  sell and support our products and our business may lack strategic direction 
we are dependent upon key members of our management team 
in addition  our future success will depend in large part upon our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining such personnel 
we currently maintain a key person life insurance policy in the amount of million on peter j 
murphy 
if we lose the services of mr 
murphy or one or more other key individuals  or are unable to attract additional qualified members of the management team  our ability to implement our business strategy may be impaired 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical and sales personnel  we may not be able to develop  sell and support our products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitive position could be harmed and our revenues could be adversely affected 
we rely on a combination of patent and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
we own patents issued and have patent applications pending in the united states and have several corresponding foreign patent applications pending 
our existing patents may not effectively protect our intellectual property and could be challenged by third parties  and our future patent applications  if any  may not be approved 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies 
competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our competitors could offer similar products using materials  processes or technologies developed by us  potentially harming our competitive position and our revenues 
if we become involved in a protracted intellectual property dispute  or one with a significant damages award or which requires us to cease selling some of our products  we could be subject to significant liability and the time and attention of our management could be diverted 
although no claims have been asserted against us for infringement of the proprietary rights of others  we may be subject to a claim of infringement in the future 
an intellectual property lawsuit against us  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights 
a successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling  or redesign  products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property 
we could also be required to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology 
we might not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to develop a non infringing technology on a timely basis or to license the infringed technology on acceptable terms  our revenues could decline and our expenses could increase 
we may  in the future  be required to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
litigation with respect to patents and other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other aspects of our business 
market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile  and our stock price may be volatile as well 
from time to time the us stock market has experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices for the common stock of technology companies in particular have been extremely volatile 
in the past  broad market fluctuations that have affected the stock price of technology companies have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
if we were to become involved in this type of litigation  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management s attention  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our operating expenses and reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these regulations  could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we could also be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing of our products were to occur by us or our suppliers  we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  control of material and manufacturing quality  and costs and product testing  are critical factors in our future growth 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor  develop  modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs  or potential damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our stock is thinly traded 
our stock is thinly traded and you may have difficulty in reselling your shares quickly 
the low trading volume of our common stock is outside of our control  and we cannot guarantee that trading volume will increase in the near future 
we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock any time in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our current financing agreements prohibit the payment of dividends 
the future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings  capital requirements  financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider 
for the foreseeable future  we will use earnings from operations  if any  to finance our growth  and we will not pay dividends to our common stockholders 
you should not rely on an investment in our common stock if you require dividend income 
the only return on your investment in our common stock  if any  would most likely come from any appreciation of our common stock 
we may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses 
additionally  the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
from time to time  we are subject to income tax audits 
while we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with significant additional taxes  there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we could use preferred stock to resist takeovers  and the issuance of preferred stock may cause additional dilution 
our articles of organization authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  shares are issued and outstanding as a result of our preferred stock offering completed in june our articles of organization gives our board of directors the authority to issue preferred stock without approval of our stockholders 
we may issue additional shares of preferred stock to raise money to finance our operations 
we may authorize the issuance of the preferred stock in one or more series 
in addition  we may set the terms of preferred stock  including dividend and liquidation preferences  voting rights  conversion privileges  redemption terms  and other privileges and rights of the shares of each authorized series 
the issuance of large blocks of preferred stock could possibly have a dilutive effect to our existing stockholders 
it can also negatively impact our existing stockholders liquidation preferences 
in addition  while we include preferred stock in our capitalization to improve our financial flexibility  we could possibly issue our preferred stock to friendly third parties to preserve control by present management 
this could occur if we become subject to a hostile takeover that could ultimately benefit parlex and parlex s stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in us and foreign interest rates and fluctuations in exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk our primary bank facility bears interest at our lender s prime rate plus 
we also have a subsidiary bank note for  at libor plus 
the prime rate is affected by changes in market interest rates 
these variable rate lending facilities create exposure for us relating to interest rate risk  however  we do not believe our interest rate risk to be material 
as of june   we had an outstanding balance under our primary bank facility of  and an outstanding balance of  under our subsidiary note 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately  over the next fiscal year  and such amount would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the remainder of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates and is therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
currency risk sales of parlex shanghai  parlex interconnect  poly flex circuits limited and parlex europe are typically denominated in the local currency  which is also each company s functional currency 
this creates exposure to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the chinese us and chinese us exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
based upon the current volume of transactions in china and the united kingdom and the stable nature of the exchange rate between china and the us  we do not believe the market risk is material 
we do not engage in regular hedging activities to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
parlex shanghai and parlex interconnect had combined net assets as of june  of approximately million 
poly flex circuits limited and parlex europe had combined net assets as of june  of approximately million 
we believe that a change in exchange rates would not have a significant impact upon parlex shanghai s or poly flex circuits limited s financial position  results of operation or outstanding debt 
as of june   parlex shanghai had outstanding debt of approximately million 
as of june   poly flex circuits limited had no outstanding debt
