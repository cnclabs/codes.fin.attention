item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business summary we are a real estate investment trust  or reit  and own a portfolio of primarily upscale  full service hotels and resorts 
our portfolio is diversified geographically as well as by franchise and brand affiliations 
as of december   we owned hotels with  rooms 
we have sold nine hotels with  rooms since january  ten of the remaining hotels are currently planned for disposition 
our hotels are located in major metropolitan areas  rapidly growing secondary markets or resort locations in the united states and one in canada 
all of our hotels are leased by our taxable subsidiaries and all are currently managed by interstate hotels resorts interstate hotels  which was created on july  through the merger of meristar hotels resorts  inc and interstate hotels corporation 
our taxable subsidiaries are parties to management agreements with a subsidiary of interstate hotels to manage all of our hotels 
under these management agreements  the taxable subsidiaries pay a management fee for each property to a subsidiary of interstate hotels 
the taxable subsidiaries in turn make rental payments to our operating partnership under the participating leases 
under the management agreements  the base management fee is of total hotel revenue  plus incentive payments based on meeting performance thresholds that could total up to an additional of total hotel revenue 
all of the agreements expire in and have three renewal periods of five years each at the option of interstate hotels  subject to some exceptions 
since the july merger that formed interstate hotels  we and interstate hotels have been separating the senior management teams of the two companies in order to allow each senior management team to devote more attention to its respective company s matters 
in december  our board of directors and that of interstate hotels each formed a special committee of independent directors to explore further changes to the relationship between our company and interstate hotels  including possible changes to the terms  or complete elimination  of the intercompany agreement 
discussions also include possible changes to the provisions of the various management agreements relating to our hotels  including the method of calculation for the incentive fee and termination fees 
results overview at the beginning of  we set out a strategy to position our company to best take advantage of an expected economic and industry recovery 
our strategy included the following key initiatives reshape the portfolio through asset sales  enhance liquidity  reduce our leverage and extend our debt maturities  begin an aggressive renovation program of our core product offering  and focus on asset performance through aggressive asset management 
we have made significant progress in reshaping our portfolio with our asset disposition program  completing the sale of non core assets through march  we have generated million in gross cash proceeds  which has significantly enhanced our liquidity 
through the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes due in july of this year  we were able to nearly completely refinance the borrowings under our convertible notes due to below million and extend this nearest maturing debt security to our issuance of common stock for cash in september  the debt for equity exchange transactions  as well as the completion of our million  year  commercial mortgage backed securities financing  and the million senior credit facility have also significantly enhanced our liquidity  reduced our leverage and aided in extending our debt maturities 
we have begun an aggressive renovation program for our core assets 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures over the next two years to upgrade our core product to meet or exceed the standards of our primary brands hilton  marriott  and starwood to improve the competitiveness of these assets in their markets and enable them to more fully participate in any economic recovery 
our operating results were negatively affected by the continued sluggish economy in the first half of  as well as geopolitical events  war and the continued threat of domestic terrorism 
although the general economic indicators began to show positive signs of recovery in the second half of the year  as of year end  this general economic growth had not yet translated into meaningful growth in lodging demand and consequently revpar 
however  it has not been unusual for demand growth in the hospitality industry historically to lag an economic recovery by at least six to nine months 
we continue to face the challenge of decreased corporate travel  changing channels of distribution including increased internet bookings  pressure on room rates and margin erosion 
see results of operations section below for a more detailed discussion 
results of operations our revenues are derived from the operations of our hospitality properties  including room  food and beverage revenues  as well as from our leases of office  retail and parking rentals 
included in our operating results is our cumulative preferred return on our partnership interest in mip 
operating costs include direct costs to run our hotels  management fees to interstate hotels for the management of our properties  depreciation of our properties  impairment charges  property tax and insurance  as well as sales  marketing and general and administrative costs 
our expenses also include interest on our debt  amortization of related debt issuance costs and minority interest allocations  which represent the allocation of income and losses to outside investors for properties that are not wholly owned 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
require that current and prior period operating results of any asset that has been classified as held for sale or has been disposed of on or after january   including any gain or loss recognized on the sale  be recorded as discontinued operations 
accordingly  we have reclassified all prior periods presented to conform to this requirement 
see footnote  dispositions and acquisitions  included in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding the amounts reclassified 
summary data for the years ended december were as follows dollars in thousands  except operating data statistics percent change vs vs summary of operations total revenue hotel operating expenses other operating expenses loss on asset impairments impairment of investment in affiliate total operating expenses operating loss income minority interest income other significant items  net interest expense  net loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations a net loss percent change vs vs operating data average daily rate occupancy revenue per available room revpar a includes loss on asset impairments of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
also includes loss on disposal of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  total revenue 
total revenue decreased in compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in room revenue directly attributable to a decrease in average daily rate 
the average daily rate declined for the year ended december  when compared with the same period in due to the downward pressures on our rates as a result of soft corporate transient and leisure demand throughout the year  coupled with an increase in sales through lower rated group  contract  and internet sales channels 
the slight increase in occupancy over the same period did not significantly offset the rate decline 
hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses increased from to due primarily to increases in food and beverage expenses and other hotel operating costs 
these expenses increased mainly due to our focus on improving guest satisfaction  as well as an increase in occupancy in over other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include general and administrative expenses  property operating costs  depreciation and amortization  and property taxes  insurance and other 
the decrease from to was due primarily to a million charge incurred related to the settlement of a million term loan due from interstate hotels during late excluding that charge  other variations in these expenses were as follows general and administrative expenses at the hotel level increased by approximately million  offset by a reduction in corporate costs from whereby costs of million were incurred related to the formal separation of management functions from interstate hotels 
property operating costs  which consist of repairs and maintenance  energy  franchise and management costs  increased million during to million 
increases in repairs and maintenance expense of million and energy costs due to the civil disruptions in venezuela and the war in iraq of million were partially offset by decreases in franchise and management fees totaling million 
we began implementing a strategic energy plan across our portfolio during the fourth quarter of  which is designed to aid in the control of volatile energy costs 
depreciation and amortization decreased million in to million from million in due to the reduction in the book value of our property and equipment stemming from the substantial asset impairment charge in the first half of also contributing to the decline were the early extinguishments of debt  thereby reducing on going amortization of related deferred financing costs 
property tax refunds and favorable resolution of property tax liabilities totaling approximately million during contributed to the million increase in property taxes  insurance and other expenses for the comparative period 
we expect to continue to face pressure from local jurisdictions as we try to minimize these costs 
loss on asset impairments 
we recognized losses on asset impairments totaling million and million related to our asset disposition program during the years ended december  and  respectively 
of these total asset impairment losses  million and million for the years ended and  respectively  are included in discontinued operations 
as of december   we had assets planned for disposition  nine of which have been sold since january  the value of our million investment in meristar investment partners  lp mip  which owns hotels and is accounted for on a cost basis  has declined due to the continued decline in mip s cash flow  particularly driven by results in four of its hotel markets 
while we believe that the cash flow and thus the value of our investment in mip will be recoverable over time  we expect that any such recovery will likely take a number of years to achieve 
the accounting rules for cost basis investments require that declines in value that are other than temporary be recognized currently 
since the decline in the value of our underlying investment in mip is other than temporary  we recognized an impairment loss of million on this investment during the fourth quarter of other significant items  net 
we recognized gains totaling million during related to the early extinguishments of debt 
on july   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the proceeds from the new issuance were used to repurchase million of the million of outstanding convertible notes due  at varying prices  resulting in a million gain 
the proceeds from the issuance were also used to repurchase million of outstanding senior subordinated notes due  at varying prices  resulting in a million gain 
during  we also repurchased a further million of these notes  at varying prices  resulting in an aggregate loss of million 
in addition  we redeemed million of the senior subordinated notes in exchange for  shares of our common stock  resulting in a gain of million 
we had three swap agreements that did not qualify for treatment as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 expire since september   one in december  one in april and one in july as of december   we had no outstanding derivative instruments 
prior year results included a net expense of million related to the swap agreements in place during that time 
current year results were not materially affected by marking to market the swap agreements that expired during prior year results also included a million loss on the fair value of derivatives due to the repayment of debt that was originally hedged 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased million due primarily to the july issuance of convertible subordinated notes due to substantially repurchase our convertible notes see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
discontinued operations 
during  we completed the sale of hotels in separate transactions for an aggregate of million in cash  resulting in loss on disposal of million 
as of december   we had seven hotels classified as held for sale  six of which we sold through march  for million in cash 
discontinued operations for the year ended december  included impairment charges totaling million related to the assets included in our disposition program 
discontinued operations for the year ended december  included impairment charges totaling million  and a million loss on disposal related to five hotels we sold during that year 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the slowing united states economy had a significant negative effect on our hotel operations in  evidenced by a sharp reduction in transient business travel 
this is reflected in the reduction in average daily rate and the reduction in occupancy in compared to we shifted our marketing efforts towards lower rated group and contract business in most markets in order to maintain a base level of occupancy in our properties 
total revenue 
total revenue decreased in from  primarily due to a million decrease in room revenue attributable to decreases in average daily rate and occupancy 
the decrease in occupancy also contributed to an million decrease in food and beverage revenue and a million decrease in telephone and conference service revenues 
hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses decreased for the year ended december  from the same period in due primarily to reductions in room expense of million as a result of lower occupancy in the year  coupled with a reduction in food and beverage costs of million 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include general and administrative expenses  property operating costs  depreciation and amortization  and property taxes  insurance and other 
general and administrative expenses increased million during the year  due primarily to the recognition of corporate reorganization costs and an increase in our marketing personnel in order to focus our efforts on group and contract business 
in each year  we recognized corporate reorganization costs  million in related to the formal separation of management functions from interstate hotels and million in related to a restructuring at the corporate headquarters 
property operating costs decreased million from million in to million in due mainly to a million decrease in franchise fees  a million decrease in management fees directly resulting from our decrease in revenues  and a million decrease in energy costs primarily due to reduced occupancy 
property taxes  insurance and other costs decreased million due primarily to a million reduction in property taxes due to favorable resolution of certain appeals  as well as a reduction in tax assessed values of certain properties 
depreciation and amortization increased million due to the purchase of replacement computer equipment for our corporate office and amortization of deferred financing fees related to the december and february issuances of our senior unsecured notes 
other operating expenses for the year ended included a million charge related to the early settlement of our note receivable with interstate hotels 
charges totaling million were incurred specific to activities and included million in swap termination fees  million of transaction costs  expensed immediately when our proposed merger with felcor lodging trust inc was terminated by both parties  a million write down of our investment in sts hotel net  and million of costs to terminate our leases with prime hospitality corporation 
loss on asset impairments 
we recognized losses on asset impairments related to our asset disposition program during the years ended december  and of total asset impairment losses  million and million for the years ended and  respectively  are included in discontinued operations 
other significant items  net 
results for included a net expense of million related to swap agreements in place during that time and also included a million loss on the fair value of derivatives due to the repayment of debt that was originally hedged 
during  we recognized million in expense when three of our swap agreements were converted to non hedging instruments because the debt being hedged was repaid 
during  we sold two hotels in separate transactions and received proceeds of million 
the sales resulted in a loss of million 
the loss recognized on these sales  as well as the operating results of these hotels  were included in continuing operations  as the provisions of sfas no 
requiring the presentation of such results in discontinued operations applies only to assets classified as held for sale or disposed of on or after january  interest expense  net 
interest expense increased in due primarily to higher interest rates 
we issued million of senior unsecured notes in december and million in february at fixed rates of interest greater than the variable rate on the debt that was repaid from the proceeds of the issuance 
discontinued operations 
during  we sold five hotels in separate transactions and received million in cash  resulting in a loss on disposal of million 
discontinued operations included impairment charges totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
funds from operations substantially all of our non current assets consist of real estate  and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  those assets are subject to straight line depreciation  which reflects the assumption that the value of real estate assets  other than land  will decline ratably over time 
that assumption is often not true with respect to the actual market values of real estate assets and  in particular  hotels  which fluctuate based on economic  market and other conditions 
as a result  management and many industry investors believe the presentation of gaap operating measures for real estate companies to be more informative and useful when other measures  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  are also presented 
in an effort to address these concerns  the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  adopted a definition of funds from operations  or ffo  which we have also adopted 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after comparable adjustments for our portion of these items related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
extraordinary items and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle as defined by gaap are also excluded from the calculation of ffo 
as defined by nareit  ffo also does not include reductions from asset impairment charges 
the securities and exchange commission  however  has expressed a position that ffo be reduced by asset impairment charges  which presentation we have adopted 
due to the significance of our hotel real estate assets  we believe ffo is an indicative measure of our operating performance and can be used to measure our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures  and expand our business 
we also use ffo in our annual budget process 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to any other performance measures prescribed by gaap 
although ffo is considered a standard benchmark utilized by the investment community  our ffo may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies 
ffo we use ffo as a measure of our performance 
the following reconciles our gaap net loss to ffo on a diluted basis amounts in thousands  except per share amounts net loss loss on disposal of assets hotel depreciation and amortization minority interest to common op unit holders ffo  a  b  c interest on convertible debt ffo  assuming dilutive conversions ffo per diluted share weighted average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding for loss per share common stock equivalents operating partnership units stock options convertible debt shares weighted average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding for ffo a funds from operations included the effect of asset impairment charges  net of additional tax benefits realized during  totaling million  or per diluted share 
b funds from operations included the effect of asset impairment charges of million  or per diluted share 
c funds from operations included the effect of asset impairment charges of million  or per diluted share 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  funds from borrowings  funds from the sales of assets and existing cash on hand 
our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations  debt service  debt repurchases  and investments in hotels including capital projects and acquisitions 
we did not pay a dividend on our common stock during  nor do we expect to pay one in we believe we have sufficient cash flow currently  and we expect to have adequate cash flow during the next twelve months in order to fund our operations  capital commitments and debt service obligations 
our current and future liquidity is  however  greatly dependent upon our operating results  which are driven largely by overall economic conditions  and since september  have been heavily affected by geopolitical concerns and other factors affecting business and leisure travel 
if general economic conditions are significantly worse than we expect for an extended period  this will likely have a negative effect on our projections of available cash flow and liquidity 
factors that may influence our liquidity include factors that affect our results of operations  including general economic conditions  demand for business and leisure travel  public concerns about travel safety related primarily to terrorism and related concerns  capital investments required to maintain our property s competitive position and other operating risks described under the caption  risk factors operating risks in item of this annual report on form k  factors that affect our access to bank financing and the capital markets  including operational risks  high leverage  covenant compliance  interest rate fluctuations  and other risks described under the caption risk factors financing risks in item of this annual report on form k  and other factors described previously under the caption  cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
we continue to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet  build liquidity  reduce our leverage and extend our debt maturities 
we have been committed to hold cash balances generally in excess of million in our operating accounts as a hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties  as well as to provide for our recurring cash requirements 
we established a new million secured revolving bank line in december  which will add flexibility to managing our liquidity 
as part of our strategy to reduce our leverage and extend our debt maturities  on july   we completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due  which rank pari passu with our convertible subordinated notes due the proceeds from the issuance were mainly used to repurchase substantially all of the convertible notes  which were our next significant maturity due in  and million of our senior subordinated notes due as a result of this transaction  we now have no material debt maturities until the senior subordinated notes mature in during  we also issued  shares of common stock in exchange for million of the senior subordinated notes  and we repurchased an additional million of these notes 
as of december   we had a little less than million of the convertible notes outstanding and had reduced the balance outstanding on the senior subordinated notes due to million 
subsequent to year end  we acquired an additional million of senior subordinated notes through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
in addition  as of march   we had purchased from available cash million of our senior unsecured notes  including million of the notes  million of the notes and million of the notes 
following these exchanges and the repurchases  we had as of march   approximately million of outstanding senior subordinated notes due and million of outstanding senior unsecured notes 
we expect to retire the remaining senior subordinated notes due in at the end of september  we completed a million  year  commercial mortgage backed securities financing  secured by a portfolio of four hotels 
we also issued in a public offering  shares of common stock at a price of per share for net proceeds totaling million in the second half of since january   we have raised to date approximately million from the sale of properties in our disposition program  including the sales of nine hotels for million since january  we ended with cash balances of million  of which million was unrestricted 
we currently have hotels after the sales in through march  planned for disposition 
we expect to generate gross proceeds of approximately million to million from the sales of these hotels 
our ability to realize these estimated proceeds is  however  dependent upon finding qualified buyers willing to pay a purchase price that we consider reasonable 
we intend to use a majority of the proceeds from any asset sales to repurchase our senior debt  reinvest in our core assets and to fund acquisitions 
our target acquisitions include those hotels strategically located in major urban markets or destination resorts  and larger  branded hotels with significant meeting space  and may involve management contracts with hotel brand owners where our long term investment focus makes us a preferred owner 
sources and uses of cash the following table shows our consolidated cash flows  generated by used in our various activities  for the years ended december in thousands vs vs operating activities investing activities financing activities our operating results and the amount of cash generated by our hotel operations were adversely affected beginning in late by the events of september  and have continued to be negatively affected by the reduction in travel resulting from geopolitical events  economic conditions  war  the continued threat of domestic terrorism  possible long term changes in travel preferences  and other factors affecting business and leisure travel 
cash flow from operations decreased also in due to higher interest rates on our senior unsecured notes issued in february as well as the higher rate on our new convertible notes issuance in july of this year 
partially offsetting these increases in interest were savings of approximately million in interest on our previous revolving credit facility  which was repaid with the net proceeds from the february senior unsecured notes issuance  as well as interest savings on the early extinguishments of debt related to our repurchases of senior subordinated notes and convertible subordinated notes 
our investing activities provided a net million of cash during the year ended december   resulting primarily from million in proceeds from the sale of non core hotel assets  and million from interstate hotels for the repayment of its note receivable  partially offset by million in capital expenditures including million of capitalized interest  million increase in cash restricted for mortgage escrows  and million in costs associated with our disposition program 
our investing activities provided a net million of cash during  resulting primarily from million of proceeds from the sale of five hotels  partially offset by million of hotel capital expenditures including million of capitalized interest  and million of advances to interstate hotels 
we generated a net million of cash from financing activities during the year ended december  due mainly to million from the issuance of new debt  million from the issuance of common stock  partially offset by million in repayments and repurchases of debt 
we used million of cash in financing activities during  primarily for the net repayment of million of our long term debt obligations and million in additional deferred financing costs related to our new debt facilities 
we must distribute to stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to preserve the favorable tax treatment accorded to reits under the internal revenue code 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distribution in order to meet the internal revenue code requirements 
in that event  we would seek to borrow additional funds or sell additional non core assets for cash  or both  to the extent necessary to obtain cash sufficient to make the distributions required to retain our qualification as a reit 
any future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined by factors including our operating results  restrictions imposed by our borrowing agreements  capital expenditure requirements  the economic outlook  the distribution requirements for reits under the internal revenue code and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
our senior unsecured notes indenture permits the payment of dividends in order to maintain reit qualification if we fall below a to fixed charge coverage ratio 
however  our senior subordinated notes indenture is more restrictive in that it permits the payment of dividends only if we exceed the to fixed charge coverage ratio 
the timing and amount of any future distributions is dependent upon these factors  and we cannot provide assurance that any such distributions will be made in the future 
long term debt long term debt consisted of the following in thousands december  senior unsecured notes secured facility  due secured facility  due convertible subordinated notes senior subordinated notes mortgage and other debt unamortized issue discount new credit facility 
in december  we entered into a new million senior credit facility  secured by six of our hotels  and terminated our previous credit facility 
the three year facility carries an annual interest rate of the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus basis points 
we currently have  and as of december   had no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
we expect to use this facility for working capital purposes and have no plans to draw on the facility in the short term 
we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs related to the issuance 
our new million senior credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants 
our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to financial covenants  including leverage  fixed charge coverage and interest coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements 
our compliance with these covenants in future periods will depend substantially upon the financial results of our hotels 
the agreement governing our new senior credit facility limits our ability to effect mergers  asset sales and change of control events and limits the payments of dividends other than those required for us to maintain our status as a reit and our ability to incur additional secured and total indebtedness 
senior unsecured notes 
as of december   we had million of aggregate principal of these notes outstanding 
these notes contain various restrictive incurrence covenants  limiting our ability to initiate or transact certain business activities if specific financial thresholds are not achieved 
one of those thresholds is having a to pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indentures  fixed charges only include interest on debt obligations and preferred equity in order to enter into certain types of transactions 
as of december   our fixed charge coverage ratio was below to  and therefore we were not permitted to enter into certain transactions  including the repurchase of our stock  the issuance of any preferred stock  the payment of dividends  the incurrence of any additional debt  or the repayment of outstanding debt before it comes due  except as noted below 
there are certain exceptions with respect to the incurrence of additional debt and early repayment of debt features in the indentures 
we have the ability to incur up to million of secured financing within restricted subsidiaries  subject to meeting other maintenance tests under the indentures 
we also have a general carve out to incur million of unspecified borrowings within a restricted subsidiary 
additionally  we are permitted to repay subordinated debt prior to its maturity from the proceeds of a pari passu or junior financing with a longer term than the debt refinanced  an equity offering  or a financing within an unrestricted subsidiary 
as of march   we had repurchased from available cash million of our senior unsecured notes  including million of the notes due  million of the notes due  and million of the notes due secured facilities 
in september  as permitted by the indentures to our senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated notes  we completed a million commercial mortgage backed securities financing  secured by a portfolio of four hotels 
the loan carries a fixed annual interest rate of and matures in we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs related to the facility 
the proceeds will be used to repay debt carrying higher interest rates  or to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions to the extent that higher interest rate debt cannot be acquired at attractive prices 
we completed a million non recourse financing secured by a portfolio of hotels in the loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of and matures in the secured facility contains standard provisions that require the servicer to maintain in escrow cash balances for certain items such as property taxes and insurance 
in addition  the facility contains a provision that requires our mortgage servicer to retain in escrow the excess cash from the encumbered hotels after payment of debt service excess cash  if net hotel operating income noi for the trailing twelve months declines below million 
this provision was triggered in october and will be effective until the hotels generate the minimum cash flow required for two consecutive quarters  at which time the cash being held in escrow will be released to us 
approximately million of cash was held in escrow under this provision as of december  in july  we signed an amendment to the loan agreement that permits the release of cash placed in escrow for all capital expenditures incurred on the encumbered properties on or after april  although the servicer will continue to retain in escrow any excess cash from the encumbered hotels  they will release cash for all capital expenditures we have incurred from april  through the date of the amendment and future capital expenditures we incur on the properties 
escrowed funds totaling approximately million were available to fund capital expenditures under this provision as of december  convertible subordinated notes 
on july   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due these notes are convertible into our common stock at any time prior to or at maturity of april   at a conversion price of per share equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the convertible notes are unsecured obligations and provide for semi annual payments of interest each on october and april we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs related to the issuance 
the proceeds from the new issuance were used to repurchase million of our million convertible notes  at varying prices  resulting in an aggregate discount of approximately million 
during the third quarter  we recognized this gain and wrote off approximately million of deferred financing costs related to the repurchase 
the remaining proceeds from the issuance were also used to repurchase a portion of our senior subordinated notes see discussion below 
senior subordinated notes 
as of december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes are unsecured obligations and provide for semi annual payments of interest each february and august the related indenture contains various restrictive covenants  which are similar to those in our senior unsecured notes 
a portion of the proceeds from the july issuance of convertible notes discussed above were used to repurchase million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes  at varying prices  resulting in an aggregate discount of approximately million 
also during  we exchanged  shares of our common stock for million of these notes  resulting in a gain of million 
in connection with the repurchases of these notes  we wrote off deferred financing costs totaling approximately million 
in  we also repurchased million of these notes for cash  at varying prices  resulting in an aggregate premium of approximately million 
we recognized this loss and wrote off approximately million of deferred financing costs related to the repurchases 
subsequent to year end  we acquired an additional million of senior subordinated notes through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
we expect to retire the remaining senior subordinated notes due in asset dispositions as discussed elsewhere  one of our key short term strategies is to sell selected non core assets  many of which were acquired as part of a portfolio 
we believe that these asset sale transactions will have the following benefits improve the overall quality of the hotel assets remaining in our portfolio  enhance the ability of our portfolio to perform well in all cycles of the economy  enhance future growth prospects when strength returns to the economy  reduce future capital requirements on a relative basis  and reduce our leverage and requirements on our liquidity resources 
we are aided in our disposition program by the fact that we can terminate the management agreement of any hotel we sell  in most cases subject to the payment of a fee as discussed below  as well as the fact that of our current assets including all of the assets remaining in our disposition program are unencumbered and only of those assets are subject to ground leases 
excluding the assets included in our disposition program  we would have unencumbered assets and nine subject to ground leases 
we recognized an impairment loss in on certain non core assets we were then actively marketing 
we sold one hotel in january for million 
late in the first quarter of  we expanded our asset disposition program to include a total of non core assets and recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of million 
in april  we sold one of these hotels for million 
during the second quarter of  we made the determination to dispose of an additional non core assets 
also  due to the market interest in certain of our other hotel assets  we decided to add an additional six assets to our disposition program 
we recognized an additional impairment loss of million related to our asset disposition program during the second quarter of in the third quarter of  we sold four more of these hotels for million 
during the third quarter of  we made the determination to dispose of one additional asset and retain one of our assets previously included in our disposition program 
we also changed our expected holding period for another asset and revised our sales prices on certain other assets included in our disposition program and recognized an additional impairment loss of million during the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we made the determination to retain eight of our assets previously included in our disposition program 
we also revised our estimated sales prices on certain assets in our disposition program and recognized an additional impairment loss of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold nine hotels included in our disposition program for gross proceeds of million 
the impairment charges are based on our estimates of the fair value of the disposition properties 
these estimates require us to make assumptions about the sales prices that we expect to realize for each property as well as the timing of a potential sale 
in making these estimates  we consider the operating results of the assets  the market for comparable properties  and quotes from brokers  among other information 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
as we dispose of the remaining assets in our disposition program  we may incur termination obligations due to interstate hotels of up to a maximum of approximately million  assuming the disposition of all of the properties in and assuming buyers of our hotel properties elect to have the properties managed by parties other than interstate hotels or do not assume the obligation as part of the sale transaction 
any such obligation would affect the calculation of the final gain or loss on the sale of a particular asset  since in accordance with current accounting guidance  the obligation is not recognized until such time as the asset disposition is complete and a termination notice is provided to interstate hotels 
at that time  the recognition of any termination obligation will be included in discontinued operations 
any obligation due under the termination provisions of the contract is payable over a period of months 
this amount may be reduced by replacement management contracts 
in addition  we may from time to time receive offers on other assets that we might consider selling 
any additional sales of these assets may result in additional impairment charges in future periods  if and when such transactions might be undertaken 
while we always consider any opportunities that may improve our financial condition or results of operations  we are not actively marketing any assets other than the properties previously discussed in our disposition program 
the remaining properties included in our disposition program as of december  represented approximately of our total portfolio  and their operating results are included in continuing operations 
for the year ended december   these properties accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our consolidated operating loss 
for purposes of this calculation  we excluded depreciation and amortization and loss on asset impairments from operating income 
capital expenditures we make ongoing capital expenditures in order to keep our hotels competitive in their markets and to comply with franchise obligations  as described further in operating risks the potential adverse impact of our failure to meet the requirements contained in our franchise and licensing agreements included in item risk factors of this annual report on form k 
we fund our capital expenditures primarily from cash generated from operations and existing cash on hand  and intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the sales of non core assets to provide capital for renovation work 
we invested million for ongoing capital expenditures during the year ended december  we have initiated an aggressive renovation program for our core assets and anticipate investing a total of million on capital expenditures in the emphasis will be on completing these projects on budget with minimal disruptions to operations 
we will focus on complete room and facility renovations  eliminating to the degree possible  piecemeal work where the typical consumer might not ascribe value to the improvements 
we believe we are timing this work appropriately to take full advantage of the anticipated industry recovery 
the properties we are now marketing for sale typically have higher per room capital expenditure requirements than our core assets 
sales of these properties will allow us to focus our capital spending dollars in the future on our core portfolio 
other financial information critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets and the recording of certain accrued liabilities 
some of our estimates are material to the financial statements 
these estimates are therefore particularly sensitive as future events could cause the actual results to be significantly different from our estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and the classification of properties as held for sale 
our hotel properties generally fall into two categories  held for use and held for sale 
our held for use properties may include those that we are actively marketing 
until such time as our criteria for held for sale are met  as described below in further detail  we maintain classification as an operational asset 
at the time we determine an asset to meet the criteria noted below  we reclassify the asset and its operations to discontinued operations 
all of our properties are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  on january  sfas no 
requires the current and prior period operating results of any asset that has been classified as held for sale or had been disposed of on or after january  and where we have no continuing involvement  including any gain or loss recognized  to be recorded as discontinued operations 
the provisions of sfas no 
also require that whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired that an analysis be performed to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations or potential sale of the asset 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from these estimates of cash flows  we write down the asset to estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
any impairment losses we recognize on assets held for use are recorded as operating expenses 
we record any impairment losses on assets held for sale as a component of discontinued operations 
based on current economic conditions and our continuing forecast and outlooks for future periods  we may be required in future periods to recognize additional impairment charges if circumstances indicate at that time that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  on january  sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
our strategy includes the disposition of certain hotel assets  all of which are managed under agreements that typically require payments to interstate hotels as a result of termination 
any such liability will be recognized at the time the asset disposition is complete and a termination notice is provided to interstate hotels 
at that time  the recognition of the termination obligation will be included in the calculation of the final gain or loss on sale and will be included in discontinued operations 
classification of properties as held for sale held for sale classification requires that the sale be probable and that the transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year  among other criteria 
assessing the probability of the sale requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty surrounding completing the transaction 
as a result  we have the following policy in aiding in assessing probability 
we classify the properties we are actively marketing as held for sale once all of these conditions are met 
our board has approved the sale  we have a fully executed agreement with a qualified buyer which provides for no significant outstanding or continuing obligations with the property after sale  and we have a significant non refundable deposit 
we carry properties held for sale at the lower of their carrying values or estimated fair values less costs to sell 
if our estimates are incorrect  the carrying values may not be accurately reflected 
we cease depreciation at the time the asset is classified as held for sale 
if material to our total portfolio  we segregate the assets and liabilities relating to our held for sale properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also reclassify the operating results of properties held for sale as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we have future long term debt and ground lease obligations related to our consolidated entities and properties 
as of december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements with mip 
the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than one to three to total one year three years five years thereafter long term debt  net of unamortized discount a senior unsecured notes b secured facility due secured facility due senior subordinated notes b convertible subordinated notes mortgage debt and other total long term debt ground lease obligations aggregate contractual obligations a for a description of the material terms of our long term debt  see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources long term debt section above 
b subsequent to year end  we repurchased million of senior unsecured notes and million of senior subordinated notes 
as we dispose of the remaining assets in our disposition program  we may incur termination obligations due to interstate hotels of up to a maximum of approximately million  assuming the disposition of all of the properties in and assuming buyers of our hotel properties elect to have the properties managed by parties other than interstate hotels or do not assume the obligation as part of the sale transaction 
any such obligation would affect the calculation of the final gain or loss on the sale of a particular asset  since in accordance with current accounting guidance  the obligation is not recognized until such time as the asset disposition is complete and a termination notice is provided to interstate hotels 
in addition  we may be obligated to pay interstate hotels termination fees of up to a maximum of approximately million with respect to the properties we have already sold 
any obligation due under the termination provisions of the contract is payable over a period of months 
this amount may be reduced by replacement management contracts 
our taxable subsidiaries are parties to management agreements with a subsidiary of interstate hotels to manage all of our hotels 
under these management agreements  the taxable subsidiaries pay a management fee for each property to a subsidiary of interstate hotels 
the taxable subsidiaries in turn make rental payments to our operating partnership under the participating leases 
under the management agreements  the base management fee is of total hotel revenue  plus incentive payments based on meeting performance thresholds that could total up to an additional of total hotel revenue 
all of the agreements expire in and have three renewal periods of five years each at the option of interstate hotels  subject to some exceptions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
while all of our outstanding debt is currently fixed rate  we look to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
to achieve our objectives  we may borrow at a combination of fixed and variable rates  and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we only enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for cash flow hedging purposes 
we do not engage in speculative transactions 
as of december   all of our outstanding debt carried fixed rates of interest  as follows in thousands average expected maturity fixed rate interest rate thereafter total fair value at our canadian operations were not material to our consolidated financial position as of december  and  or our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended december  accordingly  we were not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on our future cash flows we would receive from our foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the same periods 
to date  we have not entered into any significant foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
