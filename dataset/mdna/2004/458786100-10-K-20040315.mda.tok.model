payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term obligations note b purchase commitments operating leases note d total contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
the company is not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the company s purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons 
within the ias segment  the majority of purchase orders are related to specific customer contracts

there were no unconditional purchase obligations other than those related to inventory  services  tooling and property  plant and equipment purchased in the ordinary course of business 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  the company had aggregate off balance sheet letter of credit reimbursement agreements of million that relate to the company s performance on operating contracts with customers and generally expire within one year

inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which the company operates and has not had a significant impact upon the results of its operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
changes in the financial condition of the company s customers could result in upward or downward adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory obsolescence 
the company writes down its inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  additional inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously written off inventory is sold 
deferred tax assets 
the company has considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for these valuation allowances 
if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the company were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
goodwill and other intangibles 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews its goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the provisions of fas no 
require a two step impairment test for goodwill 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then the company performs the second step which is to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the goodwill is impaired and the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the company establishes the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow is based on the company s strategic plans and long range planning forecasts  which include revenue and profit margin assumptions  based on management s best estimate 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different  possibly resulting in a requirement to record a charge for asset impairment 
pension benefits and other postretirement benefits 
the company has retirement and pension plans which cover most of its employees 
most of the company s us employees as well as the employees of certain us subsidiaries are covered by contributory defined benefit plans  under which employees may contribute up to of covered compensation annually

revenue recognition 
the ias segment recognizes a significant portion of revenue and related profit as work progresses on long term contracts using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
the company uses this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made throughout the performance of the contracts 
since financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  recognized revenues and profits are subject to increase or decrease as the contract progresses to completion 
the company records a liability and expense for the estimated cost of product warranties and installation at the time revenue is recognized 
these estimates are based primarily on the company s historical warranty experience rates 
should the actual cost of product warranties differ  warranty liabilities could be adjusted upward or downward 
contingencies 
the company assesses its exposure to loss contingencies  including environmental  legal and income tax matters  and provides for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimates  results of operations could be adjusted upward or downward

interest rates as of december   the company s outstanding borrowings comprised million in fixed rate debentures and an million variable rate industrial revenue bond 
in addition  the company had variable rate facilities with no outstanding borrowings comprised of the revolving facility and the uk facility
