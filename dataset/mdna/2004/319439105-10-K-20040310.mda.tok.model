overview the corporation is a bank holding company established as a north carolina corporation in  with one wholly owned banking subsidiary  fcb 
the corporation s principal executive offices are located in charlotte  north carolina 
fcb is a full service bank and trust company with financial centers and five insurance offices located in counties throughout the piedmont and western half of north carolina 
the corporation also maintains operations in reston  virginia for the origination of real estate loans 
these operations also serve as a holding company for certain subsidiaries that own real estate and real estate related assets  including first and second residential mortgage loans 
the corporation s primary market area is located within north carolina and predominately centers around the metro region of charlotte  north carolina  including mecklenburg county and its surrounding counties 
charlotte is the twenty sixth largest city in the united states and has a diverse economic base 
primary business sectors in the charlotte metro region include banking and finance  insurance  manufacturing  health care  transportation  retail  telecommunications  government services and education 
the corporation believes that it is not dependent on any one or a few types of commerce due to the economic diversity of the region  however  north carolina was one of the states hardest hit by the recent recession 
over the last two years  personal income growth in north carolina of percent lagged the growth of its neighbors  georgia  percent  and virginia  percent 
since the north carolina economy has historically relied on the manufacturing and transportation sectors  it has been significantly impacted by global competition and rising energy prices 
as a result  the north carolina economy is transitioning to a more service oriented economy 
currently  the finance and insurance industries have shown the most growth 
the unemployment rate for the charlotte metro region was percent in december compared to percent in december this is the result of several layoffs in the manufacturing sector 
the increased unemployment rates reflect the structural changes taking place in the economy of the charlotte metro region 
the service industry is now the major employer followed by wholesale and retail trade 
two other sectors have begun to emerge as significant contributors  education and health services along with the leisure and hospitality sectors 
while commercial real estate lending is still not at levels seen before the recession  there has been an increase in activity 
during the third quarter  there was some speculative development and a steady stream of property acquisitions and expansions in the office  mixed use  retail and industrial sectors 
for those areas suffering from the decline of manufacturing  not only is unemployment high  but there is also a large amount of textile manufacturing and warehouse space on the market 
the corporation s operations are divided into five primary lines of business community banking  mortgage  brokerage  insurance  and financial management 
community banking provides a variety of depository accounts including interest bearing and non interest bearing checking accounts  certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
in addition  community banking offers numerous loan products including commercial  consumer  real estate and home equity loans 
the community bank also maintains atm s and enables customers to access their accounts on line 
the mortgage business provides both fixed rate and variable rate mortgage products and loan servicing 
first charter brokerage services offers full service and discount brokerage services  annuity sales and financial planning services pursuant to a third party arrangement with uvest investment services 
first charter insurance services  inc is a north carolina corporation formed to meet the insurance needs of businesses and individuals throughout the charlotte metro region 
financial management provides comprehensive financial planning  funds management  investments and record keeping services for many national companies 
the corporation derives interest income through traditional banking activities such as generating loans and earning interest on securities 
additional sources of income are derived from fees on deposit accounts and from our various lines of business including mortgage  brokerage  insurance and financial management 
also  as a part of the corporation s management of its securities portfolio  income is recognized on the sale of bond and equity securities 
improving the net interest margin is critical to the corporation s strategy to grow earnings 
the declining interest rate environment has continued to compress the net interest margin as assets repriced faster than liabilities due to the asset sensitive nature of the corporation s balance sheet 
in addition  the margin was impacted by lower effective yields on mortgage backed securities due to increased amortization of premiums resulting from increased prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages 
the corporation has recently taken major steps towards improving earnings 
in  the corporation prepaid million in longer term  fixed rate federal home loan bank fhlb advances to improve the net interest margin 
the corporation also restructured the securities available for sale portfolio to stabilize cash flows and improve the effective yields in the portfolio 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the corporation entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements which is expected to lower interest expense in maintaining sound asset quality is a major focus for the corporation 
several steps were taken in to improve asset quality 
the corporation sold million in nonaccruing and accruing higher risk loans to improve the asset quality of the loan portfolio and to contain the financial risk of these loans 
the corporation anticipated that significant future collections costs would be eliminated while allowing the corporation to focus additional efforts on growing traditional banking activities and additional sources of income discussed above 
also  the corporation sold its million credit card portfolio in the first quarter of the sale of the consumer credit card balances was a strategic decision that will allow first charter to continue to offer a first charter credit card through mbna and continue to receive ongoing fee income 
these changes are expected to reduce the credit risk profile of the corporation  which should have a positive impact on earnings 
nevertheless  the business of lending to commercial and consumer customers carries with it significant credit risk  which must be continually managed 
management monitors asset quality and credit risk on an ongoing basis 
the corporation faces competition from other banks  savings and loan associations  savings banks  credit unions  finance companies and major retail stores that offer competing financial services 
many of these competitors have greater resources  broader geographic coverage and higher lending limits than the corporation 
the corporation faces the challenge of retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
the corporation s primary methods of competition are to provide exceptional customer service and fairly priced products 
the corporation uses a quarterly independent survey of customers to review its level of customer service 
for  customer satisfaction scores surpassed the corporation s threshold of percent very satisfied 
the corporation experienced a percent decrease in the customer attrition ratio and increased opportunities to expand relationships with our customers 
our main strategy for obtaining new customers is our checking account marketing program champ  a continuous direct mailing campaign 
its success has provided the corporation with opportunities to develop new customer relationships to generate additional fee income and to shift our funding mix towards lower cost funding sources 
to meet the needs of existing and potential customers  the corporation upgraded five branches  opened one new branch  provided extend hours in select branches and its call center and added bilingual personnel 
the corporation will continue to update existing branch and expand into new areas as both market and economic conditions warrant 
another challenge for the corporation is growing fee income through other lines of business 
these sources of income provide stability to our earnings with minimal credit risk and less exposure to interest rate risk than our community bank s traditional lines of business 
in addressing this challenge  the corporation acquired two insurance agencies to expand the reach of our insurance products with businesses and individuals throughout the charlotte metro region 
in addition  the corporation acquired a third party benefits administrator which adds new customers  expands our product line and improves our technology platform 
as a result of the growth in our other lines of business  we experienced increases in noninterest income in the corporation continuously reviews other opportunities for expansion as conditions warrant 
financial summary in  the results of operations were impacted by several significant events 
they include the sale of million in nonaccruing and accruing higher risk loans to investors in june the june loan sale  the sale of the corporation s credit card portfolio  the restructuring of the securities available for sale portfolio and the prepayment of fhlb longer term fixed rate advances 
the june loan sale significantly improved the asset quality of the loan portfolio and contained the future financial risk of these loans 
the effect of the june loan sale negatively impacted the provision for loan losses which is discussed in more detail throughout this section 
in the first quarter of  the corporation sold its million credit card portfolio for a gain of million 
the sale of the consumer credit card balances was a strategic decision that allows first charter to continue to offer a first charter credit card through mbna and continue to receive ongoing fee income 
in addition  the sale of the credit card portfolio improved asset quality as these loans had a higher percentage of allocated allowance for loan losses due to their unsecured nature and higher historical loss experience 
during  the corporation identified approximately million of residential rental property loans that appeared to have questionable appraisals and collateral value 
as a result  the corporation increased the provision for loan losses by approximately million 
during early  the mortgage backed securities portfolio produced lower effective yields due to increased amortization of premiums resulting from increased prepayment speeds 
as a result  the corporation restructured the portfolio to stabilize cash flows and improve the effective yields in the portfolio 
given the low interest rate environment in  the corporation prepaid million of longer term  fixed rate fhlb advances 
these prepayments are expected to lower interest expense million or 
per diluted share after tax in net income amounted to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   a decrease from earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to several factors 
noninterest expense increased million primarily due to million of costs associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances  increased professional fees and higher salaries and employee benefits 
provision for loan losses increased million due to the june loan sale  adverse business conditions and increases in the loan portfolio 
historically low interest rates have compressed the net interest margin during  resulting in a million decline in net interest income 
a million increase in noninterest income was due to continued gains in service charges on deposit accounts  financial management  brokerage  insurance  mortgage and income from bank owned life insurance boli 
income tax expense declined million due to a decrease in income and the effective tax rate 
during  the corporation experienced strong core business fundamentals in the areas of deposits and customer satisfaction that have created momentum for the success of champ resulted in  new checking accounts being opened  which represents a percent increase over in addition  during  core retail households increased percent to  primarily due to champ 
the results of our customer satisfaction survey remained above percent very satisfied during in addition  the customer attrition ratio decreased percent  which increased opportunities to expand relationships with our customers 
for the three months ended december   first charter reported a net loss of million or per diluted share  a decrease from earnings of million or per diluted share for the same period in earnings were impacted by several factors 
noninterest expense increased million due to million of costs associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances as compared to million in  increased professional fees and higher salaries and employee benefits 
provision for loan losses increased million primarily due to increases in the loan portfolio 
noninterest income declined million 
increases in services charges  financial management income  insurance income  brokerage income and boli were more than offset by declines in gains on sales of securities and trading gains 
net income was positively impacted by a million decrease in income tax expense resulting from decreases in income and the effective tax rate 
net interest income increased million 
a decline in interest income was more than offset by a decline in interest expense due to a shift in the deposit mix from higher cost certificates of deposit to low cost core deposits and the effects of refinancing fhlb long term fixed rate advances

critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note one of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the corporation considers its policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be one of its most critical accounting policies because it requires management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the corporation has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
the determination of the level of the allowance and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses  rests upon various judgments and assumptions  including i general economic conditions  ii loan portfolio composition  iii prior loan loss experience  iv management s evaluation of credit risk related to both individual borrowers and pools of loans and v observations derived from the corporation s ongoing internal audit and examination processes and those of its regulators 
the first component of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation allowance for impaired and certain classified loans  is computed based on documented reviews performed by the corporation s credit risk management 
the reviews are completed for impaired commercial relationships greater than  and classified relationships greater than  credit risk management typically estimates these valuation allowances by considering the fair value of the underlying collateral for each impaired loan using current appraisals or estimates of values 
the results of these estimates are updated quarterly or periodically as circumstances change 
changes in the dollar amount of impaired loans or in the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral can impact the valuation allowance on impaired loans and  therefore  the overall allowance for loan losses 
the second component of the allowance for loan losses  the portion attributable to all other loans without specific reserve amounts  is determined by applying historical loss rates to the outstanding balance of loans 
the portfolio is segmented into two major categories commercial loans and consumer loans  which include mortgage  general consumer  consumer real estate  home equity and consumer unsecured 
commercial loans are segmented further by risk grade  so that separate loss factors are applied to each pool of commercial loans 
the historical loss factors applied to the commercial segments are determined using a migration analysis tool that computes current loss estimates by credit grade using a trailing loss history database 
since the migration analysis is based on trailing data  the percentage loss estimates can change based on actual losses 
changes in commercial loan credit grades or in the mix of the portfolio can also impact this component of the allowance for loan losses from period to period 
consumer loans are segmented further by collateral types in order to apply separate loss factors to each pool of consumer loans 
the historical loss factors applied to the consumer segments are a twelve month rolling average of losses 
since the loss factors are based on historical data  the percentage loss estimates can change based on actual losses 
the third component of the allowance for loan losses is intended to capture the various risk elements of the loan portfolio which may not be sufficiently captured in the historical loss rates 
these factors currently include intrinsic risk  operational risk and concentration risk 
intrinsic risk relates to the impact of current economic conditions on the corporation s borrower base  the effects of which may not be realized by the corporation in the form of charge offs for several periods 
the corporation monitors and documents various local  regional and national economic data  and makes subjective estimates of the impact of changes in economic conditions on the allowance for loan losses 
operational risk includes factors such as the likelihood of loss on a loan due to procedural error 
historically  the corporation has made additional loss estimates for certain types of loans that were either acquired from other institutions in mergers or were underwritten using policies that are no longer in effect at the corporation 
these identified loans are considered to have higher risk of loss than currently reflected in historical loss rates of the corporation  so additional estimates of loss are made by management 
concentration risk includes the risk of loss due to extensions of credit to a particular industry  loan type or borrower that may be troubled 
the corporation monitors its portfolio for any excessive concentrations of loans during each period  and if any excessive concentrations are noted  estimates of loss would be made 
changes in the allowance for loan losses for these subjective factors can arise from changes in the balance and types of outstanding loans  as well as changes in the underlying conditions which drive a change in the percentage used 
as more fully discussed below  the corporation continually monitors the portfolio in an effort to identify any other factors which may have an impact on loss estimates within the portfolio 
all estimates of the loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to continued risk that the real estate market and economic conditions in general could continue to change and therefore result in additional losses and require increases in the provision for loan losses 
if management had made different assumptions about probable loan losses  the corporation s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
for additional discussion concerning the corporation s allowance for loan losses and related matters  see allowance for loan losses 
equity method investments the corporation s equity method investments represent investments in venture capital limited partnerships 
the corporation s recognition of earnings or losses from an equity method investment is determined by the corporation s share of the investee s earnings on a quarterly basis or  in the case of some smaller investments  on an annual basis if there has been no significant change in values 
the limited partnerships generally provide their financial information during the quarter after the end of a given period  and the corporation s policy is to record its share of earnings or losses on these equity method investments in the quarter such information was received 
these limited partnerships record their investments in investee companies on a fair value basis  with changes in the underlying fair values being reflected as an adjustment to their earnings in the period such changes are determined 
the earnings of these limited partnerships  and therefore the amount recorded on an equity method basis by the corporation  are impacted significantly by changes in the underlying value of the companies in which these limited partnerships invest 
all of the companies in which these limited partnerships invest are privately held  and their market values are not readily available 
estimations of these values are made by the management of the limited partnerships and are reviewed by the corporation s management for reasonableness 
the assumptions in the valuation of these investments include the viability of the business model  the ability of the investee company to obtain alternative financing  the ability to generate revenues in future periods and other subjective factors 
given the inherent risks associated with this type of investment in the current economic environment  there can be no guarantee that there will not be widely varying gains or losses on these equity method investments in future periods 
if management of the limited partnerships had made different assumptions about the valuation of these investments  the corporation s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
at december  and december  the total book value of equity method investments was million and million  respectively  and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
of the million  million represents investments in venture capital partnerships  which invest primarily in equity securities 
the remaining million is invested in small business investment companies sbics  which make debt investments that qualify for the investment test under the community reinvestment act 
at december   the corporation s remaining commitment to fund the equity method investments was million and represented commitments to venture funds that are sbics 
these remaining commitments are callable in derivative investments in the first quarter of  the corporation entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to provide an exchange of interest payments computed on notional amounts that will offset any undesirable change in fair value resulting from market rate changes on designated hedged items 
see note twenty one of the consolidated financial statements for more information on subsequent events 
the corporation intends to account for these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the fair value of the related fhlb advances 
accordingly  in future periods the corporation will record  in noninterest income  the net change in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the related fhlb advances  provided the criteria for hedge accounting continues to be met 
in the event such criteria are not met in a future period  the corporation will cease recording the change in fair value of the fhlb advances and will amortize into earnings the then carrying value of the interest rate swap over the life of the hedged item 
the corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
the corporation will discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge  and will reflect changes in fair value through the income statement 
earnings performance net interest income and margin net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
an analysis of the corporation s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and average balance sheets for the last three years is presented in table two 
the changes in net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis from year to year are analyzed in table three 
for the year ended december   net interest income amounted to million  a decrease of approximately percent from net interest income of million in the decrease in net interest income was mainly due to lower interest income on earning assets resulting from the continued effects of the declining interest rate environment 
the corporation sold million in nonaccruing and accruing higher risk loans in the second quarter of and million in credit card loans in the first quarter of the reinvestment of these proceeds was made in lower yielding securities 
in addition  the corporation sold million in bonds in the fourth quarter of and reinvested the proceeds into boli 
this investment is classified as an other asset on the balance sheet  and the income is recognized as other noninterest income rather than being recognized as interest income 
also  during  the mortgage backed securities portfolio produced lower effective yields due to increased amortization of premiums resulting from increased prepayment speeds of underlying mortgages 
as a result  the corporation sold approximately million of these mortgage backed securities in order to stabilize cash flows and to improve effective yields in this portfolio 
these proceeds were reinvested in fixed term agency securities and mortgage backed securities of a shorter average life and at a lower current coupon 
the boli transaction  loan sales and the investment portfolio restructuring resulted in a change in the mix of earning assets from higher yielding loans to lower yielding securities 
the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
this decrease was due to a decline in interest rates across the yield curve  a shift in funding sources from higher cost retail certificates of deposit to lower cost transaction based accounts and the benefits from the refinancing of million of fhlb fixed term advances in and million of fhlb fixed term advances late in the net interest margin tax adjusted net interest income divided by average interest earning assets decreased basis points to percent in  compared to percent in the decrease reflects the impact of the declining interest rate environment  which continued to compress the net interest margin as assets repriced faster than liabilities due to the asset sensitive nature of the corporation s balance sheet 
in addition  reinvestment rates of assets were lower than rates earned by assets previously on the balance sheet 
if interest rates remain stable in  management expects the net interest margin to remain near the fourth quarter level of percent 
the primary objective of interest rate risk management is to minimize the effect changes in interest rates have on the net interest margin while maintaining an appropriate interest rate risk profile 
average interest earning assets increased million to billion for the year ended december  compared to billion for the same period 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in the corporation s average securities available for sale 
the increase in average securities available for sale was due to the securitization of million of mortgage loans held for sale and the net purchases of securities used to increase earning assets 
early in the first quarter of  the corporation increased its securities available for sale portfolio to offset the effects of weak loan demand 
average interest earning assets increased due to growth in the corporation s average loans and loans held for sale portfolio  which increased million mainly due to fourth quarter loan growth 
the increase in average loans and loans held for sale was partially offset by the june loan sale  the sale of million of credit card loans and the mortgage loan securitizations 
in addition to the increase in average interest earning assets  the corporation experienced an increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
average deposits increased million during a major contributor to the decrease in interest expense was a shift in average deposits from higher cost certificates of deposits to lower cost transaction based accounts 
while certificates of deposits declined on average million  noninterest bearing and other core deposit categories increased million  primarily due to the continued success of champ 
during  average other borrowings increased million and were used to fund loan growth and securities purchases

noninterest income the major components of noninterest income are derived from service charges on deposit accounts as well as other banking products and services from our various lines of business including brokerage  mortgage  insurance and financial management 
in addition  the corporation realizes gains from the sale of bond and equity securities and income from our investment in boli 
noninterest income increased million  or percent  to million compared to the same period in the increase was due to several factors 
net losses from equity method investments amounted to million in versus net losses of million for the corporation s investment in boli resulted in a million increase in income as the product was purchased late in the fourth quarter of service charges on deposit accounts increased million due to growth in checking accounts and increased activity 
in the first quarter of  the corporation sold its credit card portfolio for a gain of million 
financial management income increased million primarily due to the purchase of a third party benefits administrator in the third quarter of mortgage services income increased million  which was driven by record refinancing volume based on record low interest rates 
brokerage revenues increased million as customers began to return to the equities market 
insurance services income increased million partly due to the acquisition of two insurance agencies 
other noninterest income increased million due to increased atm fees  merchant income and mortgage servicing income 
these improvements were partially offset by a million reduction in gains on sales of securities and a million decrease in trading gains 
in addition  gains on the sale of bank property amounted to million and million for and  respectively

noninterest expense was also impacted by a million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to additional personnel  including the acquisition of a third party benefits administrator and two insurance agencies  increased medical expenses and increased commission based compensation due to increased revenue in our mortgage  brokerage and insurance services areas 
these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and employee benefit accruals 
other items impacting noninterest expense were a million increase in marketing expense primarily associated with the implementation of champ and a million increase in other operating expense primarily due to increased mortgage servicing fees  non credit losses and other miscellaneous expenses 
management anticipates a decline in noninterest expense of approximately percent in because management does not anticipate incurring any cost on prepaying borrowings and professional fees are expected to decline as several projects near completion 
the efficiency ratio  noninterest expense divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income less gain on the sale of securities  increased to percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  a significant portion of the increase in the efficiency ratio relates to the million of costs associated with the prepayment of federal home loan bank advances and the previously discussed million increase in professional fees

business segments the corporation s operations are divided into five operating segments commercial banking  brokerage  insurance  mortgage and financial management 
these segments are identified based on the corporation s organizational structure  and the corporation s chief operating decision makers review separate results of operations of each of these operating segments 
for purposes of segment reporting  the corporation has only one reportable segment  fcb  the corporation s primary banking subsidiary 
fcb provides businesses and individuals with commercial loans  retail loans  and deposit banking services 
brokerage  insurance  mortgage and financial management are reported as other operating segments 
of these segments  the results of operations of fcb constitute a substantial majority of the consolidated net income  revenues and assets of the corporation  as set forth in note two of the consolidated financial statements

the decrease was primarily due to i a million increase in noninterest expense which was comprised of prepayment cost associated with the refinancing of million of longer term  fixed rate fhlb advances  increased professional fees due to the june loan sale  consulting fees to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  the review and revision of our procedures for compliance with the bank secrecy act  fees related to the investigation and collection of questionable residential rental property loans and increased marketing expense associated with the implementation of champ  ii a million increase in the provision for loan losses arising from the june loan sale  adverse business conditions and increases in the loan portfolio and iii a million decrease in net interest income due to lower interest income on earning assets partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from the continued effects of a declining interest rate environment 
this decrease was partially offset by a million decrease in income tax expense due to a decrease in taxable income and the effective tax rate and a million increase in noninterest income resulting from the corporation s investment in boli  growth in services charges on deposit accounts and from gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio 
management anticipates a decline in noninterest expense of approximately percent in because management does not anticipate incurring any cost on prepaying borrowings and professional fees are expected to decline as several projects near completion 
other operating segments reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same year ago period 
the decrease in the net loss was primarily due to higher noninterest income due to increases in brokerage services revenues  mortgage fee income  insurance services revenues primarily due to the acquisition of two insurance agencies and financial management income primarily due to the acquisition of a third party benefits administrator 
the increases were partially offset by increased noninterest expense due to higher incentive compensation based on the increases in noninterest income 
other reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to net loss of million for the same year ago period 
the decrease in the net loss was primarily due to a million net loss on equity method investments for the year ended december  versus a net loss of million for the year ended december  in addition  gains on sale of equity securities amounted to million and million for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
these changes resulted in an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  balance sheet analysis securities available for sale the securities portfolio  all of which is classified as available for sale  is a component of the corporation s asset liability management strategy 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  and other factors 
securities available for sale are accounted for at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the fair value of the securities portfolio is determined by a third party 
the valuation is determined as of a date within close proximity to the end of the reporting period based on available quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar securities if a quoted market price is not available 
at december   securities available for sale were billion or percent of total assets  compared to billion  or percent of total assets  at december  the increase in securities available for sale was primarily due to the securitization of million of mortgage loans held for sale during  as well as the net purchase of million of securities used to increase earning assets 
the corporation increased its securities available for sale portfolio early in the first quarter of to offset the effects of weak loan demand 
during  the corporation changed the mix of the portfolio to stabilize cash flows by selling mortgage backed securities which had produced a lower effective yield due to increased amortization of premiums  and reinvesting the proceeds in fixed term agency securities and mortgage backed securities of a shorter average life and at a lower coupon 
the carrying value of securities available for sale was approximately million above their amortized cost at december  and million above their amortized cost at december  the weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  the following table shows  as of december    and  the carrying value of i us government obligations  ii us government agency obligations  iii mortgage backed securities  iv state and municipal obligations  and v equity securities

loans held for sale decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease was due to the securitization and sale of mortgage loans during the year 
loan portfolio the corporation s loan portfolio at december  consisted of six major categories commercial non real estate  commercial real estate  construction  mortgage  consumer  and home equity 
within these six segments the corporation targets customers in our geographic area  works within most business segments and focuses on a relationship based business model 
pricing is driven by quality  loan size  the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition 
the corporation is primarily a secured lender in all these loan categories 
the corporation s loans are generally five years or less in duration with the exception of home equity lines and residential mortgages  for which the terms range from to years 
in addition  the corporation has a program in which it buys and sells portions of loans  both participations and syndications  from key strategic partner financial institutions  with which the corporation has established relationships 
this portfolio includes commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans 
this program enables the corporation to diversify both its geographic and its total exposure risk 
commercial non real estate the corporation s commercial non real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market businesses with sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
commercial lending includes commercial  financial  agricultural and industrial loans 
pricing on commercial non real estate loans  driven largely by the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition  is usually tied to widely recognized market indexes  such as the prime rate  the london interbank offer rate libor or rates on us treasury securities 
commercial real estate similar to commercial non real estate lending  the corporation s commercial real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market business with sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
the real estate loans are both owner occupied and project related 
as with commercial non real estate loans  pricing on commercial real estate loans  driven largely by the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition  is usually tied to widely recognized market indexes  such as the prime rate  libor or rates on us treasury securities 
construction real estate construction loans include both commercial and residential construction permanent loans  which are intended to convert to permanent loans upon completion of the construction project 
loans for commercial construction are usually to in market developers  builders  businesses  individuals or real estate investors for the construction of commercial structures primarily in the corporation s market area 
from time to time  the corporation purchases construction loans in other market areas through a correspondent relationship 
construction loans purchased are typically serviced by third parties 
loans are made for purposes including  but not limited to  the construction of industrial facilities  apartments  shopping centers  office buildings  homes and warehouses 
the properties may be constructed for sale  lease or owner occupancy 
mortgage the corporation originates family residential mortgage loans throughout the corporation s footprint and in reston  virginia  which is a loan origination office 
the corporation offers a full line of products  including conventional  conforming  and jumbo fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages which are originated and sold into the secondary market  however  from time to time a portion of this production is retained and are serviced by the corporation 
consumer the corporation offers a wide variety of consumer loan products 
various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to qualifying existing customers and to other creditworthy candidates in the corporation s market area 
unsecured loans  including revolving credits eg checking account overdraft protection and personal lines of credit are provided and various installment loan products such as vehicle loans are offered 
all consumer lending is centrally decisioned and documented 
home equity home equity loans and lines are secured by first and second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
as with all consumer lending  home equity loans are centrally decisioned and documented to ensure the underwriting conforms to the corporate lending policy 
gross loans increased percent to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the growth in loans was primarily due to a million increase in construction loans  which includes approximately million of family construction loans purchased in the third and fourth quarters of through a correspondent relationship 
in addition  home equity loans increased million and mortgage loans primarily adjustable rate loans increased million driven by refinancings and the low interest rate environment 
these increases were partially offset by the june loan sale and the sale of the corporation s million credit card portfolio 
the table below summarizes loans in the classifications indicated as of december      and table nine loan portfolio composition december  dollars in thousands commercial real estate commercial non real estate construction mortgage consumer home equity total loans less allowance for loan losses unearned income loans  net deposits the ability to generate deposits has been enhanced by the introduction of champ for individuals during the fourth quarter of and business champ during the first quarter of as a result  the corporation opened  new checking accounts in  more than twice the number in in addition  during the first quarter of the corporation introduced a new money market account  the money market max account 
this product has been very successful with total balances at december  of million 
the emphasis of these programs is to shift our funding mix towards lower cost funding sources  and to develop new customer relationships to generate additional fee income opportunities 
table two provides information on the average amounts of deposits and illustrates the shift in deposits as lower cost money market  checking  savings and noninterest bearing deposits increased million and higher cost other time deposits decreased million 
other borrowings other borrowings increased million during the year  to billion at december   from billion at december  these borrowings were principally used to fund loan growth and securities purchases 
during  the corporation incurred million in prepayment penalties associated with the refinancing of million in fixed term fhlb advances 
the following is a schedule of other borrowings which consists of the following categories securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and fhlb borrowings for the years ended december   and table ten other borrowings dollars in thousands federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  fhlb and other borrowings balance as of december average balance maximum outstanding at any month end interest rate as of december average interest rate credit risk management the corporation s credit risk policy and procedures are centralized for every loan type 
in addition  all mortgage  consumer and home equity loans are centrally decisioned 
all loans flow through an independent closing unit to ensure proper documentation 
lastly  all known collection or problem loans are centrally managed by experienced workout personnel 
to monitor the effectiveness of policies and procedures  management maintains a set of asset quality standards for past due  nonaccrual and watch list loans and monitors the trends of these standards over time 
these standards are approved by the board of directors and reviewed quarterly with the board of directors for compliance 
loan administration and underwriting the bank s chief credit officer is responsible for the continuous assessment of the bank s risk profile as well as making any necessary adjustments to policies and procedures 
commercial loans less than  may be approved by experienced loan officers  within their loan authority 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are approved by signature authority requiring at least two experienced lenders for any relationships greater than  and an independent risk manager whenever the relationship is greater than million 
all relationships greater than million receive a comprehensive annual review by the senior lending officers of the bank  which is then reviewed by the independent risk management officers and the final approval officer with the appropriate signature authority 
commitments over million are further reviewed by senior lending officers of the bank  the chief credit officer and the lending oversight committee comprised of executive and senior management 
in addition  commitments over million are reviewed by the board of directors loan committee 
these oversight committees provide policy  process  product and specific relationship direction to the lending personnel 
the corporation has a general target lending limit of million per relationship  however  at times some loans may exceed that limit 
as of december   the corporation had eight relationships with exposure greater than the million lending limit 
at december   the total loan balance of these relationships was million  all of which were current  with unfunded commitments totaling million 
the corporation s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made  based to a great extent on the corporation s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the corporation s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the corporation s credit policies and procedures 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity are deemed less risky than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  as the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
consumer loans  being smaller in size  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the corporation s least risky loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans as home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decisioning process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
this process is detailed in the underwriting guidelines which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
the corporation s primary market area includes the state of north carolina but predominately centers around the metro region of charlotte 
at december   the majority of the total loan portfolio  as well as a substantial portion of the commercial and real estate loan portfolio  represents loans to borrowers within this metro region 
an economic downturn in our primary market area could adversely affect our business 
the diversity of the region s economic base tends to provide a stable lending environment 
no significant concentration of credit risk has been identified due to the diverse industrial base in the region 
derivatives credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost should the counter parties with contracts in a gain position to the corporation completely fail to perform under the terms of those contracts assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral 
in managing derivative credit risk  both the current exposure  which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date  as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered 
in managing credit risk associated with its derivative activities  the corporation deals primarily with commercial banks  broker dealers and corporations 
to minimize credit risk  the corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements  which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counter party upon the occurrence of certain events 
as of december   the corporation had no such derivative financial instruments outstanding 
in the first quarter of  the corporation entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to provide an exchange of interest payments computed on notional amounts that will offset any undesirable change in fair value resulting from market rate changes on designated hedged items 
see asset liability management and interest rate risk for further details regarding these interest rate swap agreements 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned oreo 
the nonaccrual status is determined after a loan is days past due as to principal or interest  unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
oreo represents real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof and is generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
as a result of the june loan sale and the million credit card portfolio sale  the corporation s credit risk profile improved significantly as nonaccrual loans decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  in addition  classified assets at december  decreased to million compared to million at december  oreo decreased to million at december  from million at december  the sale of the two largest properties in the oreo portfolio during the second quarter of resulted in the decrease in oreo

the increase in the past due ratio during the fourth quarter of  was mainly attributable to one commercial relationship which is now current and is not reflective of a trend in the overall portfolio 
the table below summarizes the corporation s asset quality ratios over the past five quarters

management anticipates that nonaccrual loans may increase in the near term as some customers continue to experience difficulties in this current economic environment 
management has taken current economic conditions into consideration when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses for a more detailed discussion 
the determination to discontinue the accrual of interest is based on a review of each loan 
generally  accrual of interest is discontinued on loans days past due as to principal or interest unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
management s policy for any accruing loan greater than days past due is to perform an analysis of the loan  including a consideration of the financial position of the borrower and any guarantor as well as the value of the collateral  and use this information to make an assessment as to whether collectibility of the principal and interest appears probable 
if such collectibility is not probable  the loans are placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when management determines  based on an evaluation of the underlying collateral together with the borrower s payment record and financial condition  that the borrower has the ability and intent to meet the contractual obligations of the loan agreement 
allowance for loan losses the corporation s allowance for loan losses consists of four components i valuation allowances computed on impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 ii valuation allowance for certain classified loans  iii valuation allowances determined by applying historical loss rates to those loans not considered impaired  and iv valuation allowances for factors which management believes are not reflected in the historical loss rates or that otherwise need to be considered when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
these four components are estimated quarterly by credit risk management and  along with a narrative analysis  comprise the corporation s allowance for loan losses model 
the resulting components are used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
all estimates of loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to risk in the real estate market and changes in the economic conditions in its primary market area 
changes in these areas can increase or decrease the provision for loan losses 
the table below presents certain data for the years ended december      and  including the following i the average amount of net loans outstanding during the year  ii the allowance for loan losses at the beginning of the year  iii the provision for loan losses  iv loans charged off and recovered v loan charge offs  net  vi the allowance for loan losses at the end of the year  vii the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and viii the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans at year end

prior to the loan sale  these loans had approximately million of allowance allocated to them 
during the second quarter of  an additional provision of million was recorded due to the deteriorating financial results of these relationships and independent appraisals of collateral 
an additional provision of million was recorded for the credit related discount taken in the june loan sale 
also  included in the allowance for loan losses was an allocation of million related to the previously discussed residential rental properties which have questionable appraisals and collateral values 
due to charge offs and foreclosures on these properties  the allocation has been reduced to million 
the allowance for loan losses was also reduced million due to the sale of the corporation s credit card portfolio and by net charge offs of million 
these reductions were partially offset by additional provision expense of million 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was percent of gross loans compared to percent at december  the reduction in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans was due to the corporation s improved credit risk profile which is reflected in the changes in allocation of loan losses to various loan types 
the following table presents the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses applicable to major loan categories and the percentage of the loans in each category to total loans as of december     and table fifteen allocation of the allowance for loan losses december  loan loan loan loan loan dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans commercial real estate commercial non real estate construction mortgage consumer home equity total the allowance amounts assigned to each category of loans represent the historical loss experience of the loans adjusted for current economic events or conditions 
total commercial loan allocations of allowance for loan losses remained relatively flat in commercial allowance allocations were affected by increases in the historical loss factors and were partially offset by a decrease in substandard and nonaccrual commercial loan balances 
both of these factors were impacted by the june loan sale 
management anticipates these historical loss factors will trend lower over time  as the allowance model will be impacted by lower historical losses 
mortgage loans allocation of allowance for loan losses decreased slightly in over higher mortgage loan balances were offset by lower historical loss factors 
lower allocations of allowance for loan losses were required for consumer loans in over due to the sale of the credit card portfolio as these loans had a higher historical loss experience due to their unsecured nature 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover inherent losses in the bank s loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
management believes it has established the allowance in consideration of the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions 
additionally  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to earnings which is necessary to maintain an adequate and appropriate allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the factors which influence changes in the allowance for loan losses have a direct effect on the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses changes from period to period as a result of a number of factors  the most significant of which for the corporation include the following i changes in the mix of types of loans  ii current charge offs and recoveries of loans  iii changes in impaired loan valuation allowances  iv changes in valuations in certain performing loans which have specific allocations  v changes in credit grades within the portfolio  which arise from a deterioration or an improvement in the performance of the borrower  vi changes in historical loss percentages  and vii changes in the amounts of loans outstanding  which are used to estimate current probable loan losses 
in addition  the corporation considers other  more subjective factors which impact the credit quality of the portfolio as a whole and estimates allocations of allowance for loan losses for these factors  as well 
these factors include loan concentrations  economic conditions and operational risks 
changes in these components of the allowance can arise from fluctuations in the underlying percentages used as related loss estimates for these factors  as well as variations in the portfolio balances to which they are applied 
the net change in all of these components of the allowance for loan losses results in the provision for loan losses 
for a more detailed discussion of the corporation s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million a year ago 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to an additional provision of million related to the discount taken in the previously mentioned loan sale  the addition of million to the provision for loan losses as a result of the impact of the previously mentioned loan sale on the historical loss ratios used in the allowance model and management s continuous evaluation of the current economic environment and operational risks  and the addition of million to the provision for loan losses as a result of deteriorating financial performance of several large commercial relationships and independent appraisals of collateral 
these relationships were subsequently sold as a part of the previously mentioned loan sale 
in addition  during the second quarter of  the corporation identified up to residential rental property loans totaling approximately million  some of which appeared to have questionable appraisals and collateral value 
these loans were made by one loan officer who is no longer employed by the corporation 
the appraisals received by the corporation were completed by appraisers who were not employees of the corporation 
this matter was reported by management to authorities and is under continuing investigation by management and by those authorities 
as a result of management s investigation  the corporation increased the provision for loan losses in the second quarter of by approximately million 
at december   there were loans remaining in this portfolio totaling approximately million with an allocated allowance of million 
as management s investigation continues  it is possible that an additional provision for loan losses may be required with respect to these loans 
the provision for loan losses was also impacted by an increase in net charge offs of million compared to and increases in the loan portfolio in compared to net charge offs for the year ended december  amounted to million  or percent of average loans compared to million  or percent of average loans for the same period 
these increases in net charge offs were due to higher commercial and consumer loan charge offs due to the impact of the continued weak economic environment and million of residential rental property loans charged off 
during  the corporation made no changes to its estimated loss percentages for economic factors 
as a part of its quarterly assessment of the allowance for loan losses  the corporation reviews key local  regional and national economic information  and assesses its impact on the allowance for loan losses 
based on its review for the year ended december   the corporation noted that economic conditions continue to be weak  however  management concluded that the impact on borrowers and local industries in the corporation s primary market area did not change significantly during the period 
accordingly  the corporation did not modify its loss estimate percentage attributable to economic factors in its allowance for loan losses model 
the corporation also continuously reviews its portfolio for any concentrations of loans to any one borrower or industry in the area 
to analyze its concentrations  the corporation prepares various reports showing total loans to borrowers by industry  as well as reports showing total loans to one borrower 
at the present time  the corporation does not believe it is overly concentrated to any industry or specific borrower  and therefore has made no allocations of allowances for loan losses for this factor for any of the periods presented 
the corporation also monitors the amount of operational risk that exists in the portfolio 
this would include the front end underwriting  documentation and closing processes associated with the lending decision 
additional reserves have been set aside in the allowance model for operational risk due to the differences in underwriting methodologies underlying the loans inherited through mergers 
with the implementation of one central loan policy and procedure  this risk appears to be stable 
as a result  the percent of additional allocation for the operational reserve has not changed in recent periods 
market risk management asset liability management and interest rate risk the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management strategy is to enhance earnings through balance sheet growth while reducing or minimizing the risk caused by interest rate changes 
one method used to manage interest rate sensitivity is to measure  over various time periods  the interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps  however  this method addresses only the magnitude of timing differences and does not address earnings or market value 
management uses an earnings simulation model to assess the amount of earnings at risk due to changes in interest rates 
management believes this method more accurately measures interest rate risk 
this model is updated monthly and is based on a range of interest rate shock scenarios 
under the corporation s policy  the limit for interest rate risk is percent of net interest income when considering an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points over a twelve month period 
assuming a basis point pro rata increase in interest rates over a twelve month period  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would positively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  assuming a basis point pro rata decrease in interest rates over a twelve month period  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would negatively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  although the corporation s policy for interest shock scenarios is an increase or decrease of basis points  in the current low interest rate environment the decreased interest rate shock scenario is equal to the fed funds rate of basis points 
both of the rate shock scenarios are within management s acceptable range 
in the first quarter of  the corporation entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements allow the corporation to swap higher fixed rate interest payments on long term fhlb advances for lower variable rate payments 
the interest rate swaps will result in the corporation receiving interest at an average fixed rate of percent and paying interest at an average variable rate of percent  for an average period of years with a notional amount of approximately million 
this is expected to result in lower interest expense of approximately million for the corporation intends to account for these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the fair value of the related fhlb advances 
accordingly  in future periods the corporation will record  in earnings  the net change in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the related fhlb advances  provided the criteria for hedge accounting continue to be met 
in the event such criteria are not met in a future period  the corporation will only record changes in the fair value on the interest rate swap 
as a result of swapping million of fixed rate debt payments for variable rate payments  the corporation s balance sheet would become liability sensitive 
therefore  as part of the corporation s asset liability management strategy of preserving the asset sensitive nature of the corporation s balance sheet  the corporation replaced approximately million of existing fhlb floating rate overnight borrowings with fixed rate fhlb advances with maturities of one to three years 
this is expected to increase interest expense million for the corporation expects to enter into additional interest rate swap transactions during to the extent business conditions warrant 
should the corporation enter into additional interest rate swap transactions  it is anticipated that the corporation would also replace additional fhlb floating rate overnight borrowings with fixed rate fhlb advances to preserve the asset sensitive nature of the corporation s balance sheet 
interest rate swaps will assist the corporation s asset liability management alm process 
the corporation s interest rate risk management strategy includes the use of interest rate contracts to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
the corporation s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect net interest income 
as a result of interest rate fluctuations  hedged fixed rate liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value 
gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed rate liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
see note twenty one of consolidated financial statements 
interest rate contracts  which are generally non leveraged interest rate swaps  will allow the corporation to effectively manage its interest rate risk position 
non leveraged interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments based on the contractual underlying notional amount 
exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as interest rates fluctuate 
refer to notes one and seven of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the corporation s use of written over the counter covered call options 
table sixteen summarizes the expected maturities and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with certain of the corporation s significant non trading financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits  are excluded from table sixteen as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market rates 
however  these financial instruments could expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the corporation 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
standby letters of credit are recorded as a liability by the corporation at the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
commitments to extend credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the corporation until the instrument is exercised 
refer to note sixteen of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of commitments 
the corporation does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the following table presents aggregated information about commitments of the corporation which could impact future periods

liquidity is provided by the ability to attract retail deposits  by current earnings  and by a strong capital base that enables the corporation to use alternative funding sources that complement normal sources 
management s asset liability policy is to maximize net interest income while continuing to provide adequate liquidity to meet continuing loan demand and deposit withdrawal requirements and to service normal operating expenses 
the corporation sets liquidity management guidelines for both the consolidated balance sheet  as well as for the corporation  specifically to ensure that the corporation is a source of strength for its regulated  deposit taking banking subsidiary 
the corporation s primary source of funding is from customer deposits  other borrowings  loan repayments  and securities available for sale 
cash flows from operations are a significant component of liquidity risk management and include both deposit maturities and scheduled cash flows from loan and investment maturities payments 
cash flows from operating activities declined in mainly due to greater funding needs for originations of mortgage loans held for sale than proceeds received from the sale of such loans 
cash flows from investing activities declined in as the purchases of securities available for sale and loan originations exceeded the sale and maturities of securities available for sale 
these decreases in cash flows were partially offset by cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities increased mainly due to increases in deposits and borrowings to fund the purchase of securities available for sale and loan originations 
if additional funding sources are needed  the bank has access to federal fund lines at correspondent banks and borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
in addition to these sources  as described above  the bank is a member of the fhlb  which provides access to fhlb lending sources 
at december   the bank had an available line of credit with the fhlb totaling billion with billion outstanding 
at december   the bank also had federal funds back up lines of credit totaling million  of which there were no amounts outstanding 
at december   the corporation had lines of credit with suntrust bank totaling million with million outstanding and commercial paper outstandings of million 
another source of liquidity is the securities available for sale portfolio 
see securities available for sale for further discussion 
management believes the bank s sources of liquidity are adequate to meet loan demand  operating needs and deposit withdrawal requirements 
the corporation has existing contractual obligations that will require payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about such payments to be made in future periods 
the corporation anticipates refinancing  during  any contractual obligations that are due in less than one year

capital management the objective of effective capital management is to generate above market returns on equity to our shareholders while maintaining adequate regulatory capital ratios 
the corporation uses capital to fund growth  acquire other companies  pay dividends and repurchase its common stock 
shareholders equity at december  decreased to million  representing percent of period end assets compared to million or percent of period end assets at december  the decrease was due mainly to the payment of million for the purchase and retirement of common stock  a million decrease in the after tax unrealized gain on available for sale securities resulting from an increase in rates across the yield curve and the previously mentioned restructuring of the securities portfolio  and cash dividend payments of million 
these decreases were partially offset by net income of million 
during   shares of first charter corporation common stock were repurchased and retired under the january  authorization of the corporation s board of directors to repurchase million shares 
a total of million shares have been repurchased and retired under this authorization 
on october   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of the corporation s common stock 
the principal asset of the corporation is its investment in the bank 
thus  the corporation derives its principal source of income through dividends from the bank 
certain regulatory and other requirements restrict the lending of funds by the bank to the corporation and the amount of dividends which can be paid to the corporation 
in addition  certain regulatory agencies may prohibit the payment of dividends by the bank if they determine that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
see business governmental supervision and regulation  business capital and operational requirements and note nineteen of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these restrictions 
the corporation and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the applicable federal regulatory agencies 
under the standards of the federal reserve board  the corporation must maintain a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined to total risk weighted assets of percent and a minimum ratio of total capital as defined to risk weighted assets of percent 
tier i capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles less certain intangible assets and excluding unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale 
total capital is comprised of tier i capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the corporation is the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
total capital must consist of at least percent of tier capital 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the corporation adjusted for their related risk levels using amounts set forth in federal reserve standards 
in addition to the aforementioned risk based capital requirements  the corporation is subject to a leverage capital requirement  requiring a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined previously to total adjusted average assets of percent to percent 
the bank also has similar regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve board 
see business governmental supervision and regulation  business capital and operational requirements and note nineteen of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these requirements 
at december   the corporation and the bank were in compliance with all existing capital requirements 
the most recent notifications from the corporation s and the bank s various regulators categorized the corporation and the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
in the judgment of management  there have been no events or conditions since those notifications that would change the well capitalized status of the corporation or the bank 
the corporation s capital requirements are summarized in the table below table twenty capital ratios risk based capital leverage capital tier capital total capital dollars in thousands amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage actual required excess percentage of total adjusted average assets 
the federal reserve board minimum leverage ratio requirement is percent to percent  depending on the institution s composite rating as determined by its regulators 
the federal reserve board has not advised the corporation of any specific requirement applicable to it 
percentage of risk weighted assets 
versus overview net income amounted to million  or diluted net income per share for the year ended december   compared to million or diluted net income per share for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
the increase in net income was primarily due to i a million increase in net interest income resulting from decreased interest expense  increased loan growth and higher levels of securities outstanding  ii an million increase in noninterest income resulting from growth in service charges on deposit accounts  gains on sale of securities  increased brokerage income and growth in first charter insurance services and iii a million decrease in income taxes due to a decrease in the effective tax rate 
these increases were partially offset by i a million increase in the provision for loan losses due to increased loan growth and higher levels of nonaccrual loans and ii a million increase in noninterest expense which was due to the following factors prepayment costs associated with refinancing million in fixed term advances  a reserve for a contingent liability  expenses associated with the implementation of a new computer operating system in the fourth quarter of  increased occupancy and equipment depreciation expense attributable to the first charter center which was placed into service during april of  additional personnel  and increased incentive compensation based on increases in certain noninterest income categories under established incentive plans

net interest income for the year ended december   net interest income was million  an increase of percent from net interest income of million in the increase in net interest income was driven by decreased interest expense  increased loan growth and higher levels of securities outstanding 
the reduced interest expense for was due to the lower cost of funding in a declining interest rate environment 
the increased securities interest income was due to the higher levels of securities outstanding 
the corporation began to increase its securities available for sale portfolio late in the first quarter of to offset the effects of the dampened loan growth 
average interest earning assets increased approximately million to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period 
this increase was partially due to a million increase in the corporation s average securities available for sale 
the corporation began to increase its securities available for sale portfolio late in the first quarter of  which continued through the end of as described above 
average interest earning assets also increased due to growth in the corporation s average loan portfolio  which increased million 
in addition to the increase in average interest earning assets  the corporation experienced an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million to billion during due to increases in deposits and the use of fhlb advances to fund loan growth and securities purchases 
the net interest margin tax adjusted net interest income divided by average interest earning assets decreased basis points to percent in  compared to percent in the decrease reflects the impact of the declining interest rate environment in and  which had a negative impact on the net interest margin as assets repriced faster than liabilities 
the addition of lower yielding securities  higher levels of borrowings and competitive forces related to loan and deposit pricing also had a negative impact on the net interest margin 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to the provision for loan losses of million for the comparable period 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was due to higher levels of nonaccrual loans during and million in gross loan growth for the year ended december  compared to a decrease of million in gross loans for the year ended december  the loan growth experienced during was primarily in commercial real estate  home equity lines and other secured retail credit 
noninterest income noninterest income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to i a million increase in gains on sale of securities ii a million increase in service charges on deposit accounts resulting from increased overdraft fees due to the implementation of a new automatic overdraft product in late and increased nsf fees  iii a million increase in brokerage income  iv a million increase in first charter insurance services income  and v a million increase in gains on sale of property 
the effects of these increases were partially offset by million of net losses on equity method investments  a million decrease in trading gains and a million decrease in mortgage fee income 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the comparable period 
the major contributing factors to this increase were million in prepayment penalties associated with the refinancing of million of the corporation s fixed term advances  a reserve for a contingent liability of  additional personnel  increased incentive compensation based on increases in certain noninterest income categories and increased occupancy and equipment depreciation expense attributable to the first charter center which was placed into service during april of in addition  results reflect the depreciation and data processing costs associated with the implementation of a new operating system placed into service during the fourth quarter of noninterest expense was positively impacted  due to the adoption of sfas no

in income tax expense total income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  for an effective tax rate of percent  compared to million for an effective tax rate of percent for the year ended december  the decrease in the tax expense for the year ended december   was due to the implementation of tax planning initiatives 
regulatory recommendations management is not presently aware of any current recommendations to the corporation or to the bank by regulatory authorities  which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
during the third quarter of  the bank entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of richmond and the office of the north carolina commissioner of banks  the bank s primary federal and state regulatory agencies 
the agreement arises out of certain previously disclosed regulatory examinations and requires the bank to take appropriate actions to improve its programs and procedures for complying with the currency and foreign transactions reporting act and the anti money laundering provisions of regulation h of the board of governors of the federal reserve system
