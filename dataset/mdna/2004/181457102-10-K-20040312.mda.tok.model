item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tables shown in thousands of dollars  except per share amounts the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto and other information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we design  market  and administer compensation and benefit programs for companies supplementing and securing employee benefits and provide executive compensation and related consulting services to us corporations  banks  and healthcare organizations 
we generally compete with regional firms while we market our products and services nationwide 
a majority of our revenues result from commissions paid by insurance companies that underwrite the insurance policies used to finance our clients benefit programs 
most of our clients benefit programs are financed by business owned life insurance and other financial products 
we pay commissions to employee and independent consultants based upon a percentage of our commission revenue 
we work closely with clients to design customized products that meet the specific organizational needs of the client and with insurance companies to develop unique policy features and competitive pricing 
a significant portion of our growth has been acquisition related 
business owned life insurance programs have tax advantages associated with products that are attractive to our clients 
a portion of our product offering is interest rate sensitive 
changes in tax and legislative laws can have an affect on our business  as seen over the last several years with our executive benefits practice 
we have been expanding our compensation consulting practices to diversify our product offerings 
the largest component of our general and administrative expense is salary and other benefit related costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and the results of operations  and which require us to make difficult and subjective judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies and judgements 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue sources and recognition our operating segments derive revenue primarily from o commissions paid by insurance companies issuing the policies underlying our clients benefit programs  o program design and administrative service fees paid by our clients  o executive compensation and benefit and related consulting fees  and o fees for legislative liaison and related advisory services 
our commission revenue is normally recurring  is typically paid annually and usually extends for a period of ten years or more after the sale 
commissions are paid by insurance companies and vary by policy and by program and typically represent a percentage of the premium or the cash surrender value of the insurance policies underlying the program 
first year commission revenue and related fees 
first year commission revenue and related fees are derived from two principal sources a the commission we earn when the client first purchases the policies  which revenue is recognized at the time the application is substantially completed  the client is contractually committed to purchase the insurance policies and the premiums are paid  by the client  to the insurance company  and b fees for the services related to the enrollment and initial administration of the benefit programs and underlying policies 
our first year commission revenue is frequently subject to chargeback  which means that insurance companies retain the right to recover commissions paid in the event policies prematurely terminate 
the chargeback schedules differ by product and usually apply to first year commission only 
a typical chargeback schedule  based on a percent of first year commission  is as follows year year and year year and beyond given the homogenous nature of such cases and historical information about chargebacks  we believe we are able to accurately estimate the revenue earned 
we currently maintain a chargeback allowance  which is monitored on a quarterly basis for adequacy 
the chargeback allowance is calculated based on the average percentage rate of the last two years of chargebacks multiplied by the first year revenue for the trailing twelve months 
renewal commission revenue and related fees 
renewal commission revenue is the commission we earn on the policies underlying the benefit programs we have sold in prior years 
renewal revenue is recognized on the date that the renewal premium is due or paid by the client to the insurance company depending on the type of policy 
in the case of single pay policies  renewal revenue is recognized on the date of the renewal and calculated based on a percentage of the asset value or based on a percentage of the original premium paid 
consulting fee revenue 
consulting fee revenue consists of fees charged by human capital practice  pearl meyer partners  and federal policy group for the services we perform in advising our clients on their executive compensation programs and related consulting services  retirement  benefit  actuarial  pension savings plan design and management  people strategy  compensation surveys  institutional registered investment advisory services  and fees from legislative and regulatory policy matters 
these fees are generally based on a rate per hour arrangement or a fixed monthly fee and are earned when the service is rendered 
consulting revenue generated by the executive benefits practice  banking practice  and healthcare group are included in the first year revenue line on our consolidated income statement 
administrative service fee revenue 
administrative service fee revenue consists of fees we charge our clients for the administration of their benefit programs and are earned when services are rendered 
these revenues are included in our renewal revenue line on our consolidated income statement 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred are characterized as revenues and are shown as a separate component of total revenue 
similarly  related reimbursable expenses are also shown separately within operating expenses 
we record revenue on a gross basis when we are the primary obligors in the arrangement or when we bear the credit risk in the arrangement 
we record revenue on a net basis when another party is the primary obligor in the arrangement or when another party bears the credit risk 
intangible assets intangible assets represent the excess of the costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the tangible net assets associated with an acquisition 
intangible assets consist of the net present value of future cash flows from policies inforce at the acquisition date  non compete agreements with the former owners  other identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
non compete agreements are amortized over the period of the agreements and other identifiable intangibles are amortized over their useful lives 
the net present value of inforce revenue is typically amortized between and years the expected average policy duration 
the determination of the amortization schedule involves making certain assumptions related to persistency  expenses  and discount rates that are used in the calculation of the carrying value of inforce revenue 
if any of these assumptions change or actual experience differs materially from the assumptions used  it could affect the carrying value of the inforce revenue 
we are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and the net present value of future cash flows from policies inforce  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  mortality  lapse  and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by federal and various state authorities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider the likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
restructuring costs we make provisions for restructuring costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
to determine the amounts expensed in any period  we estimate the amounts we will receive in the future for subleasing office space that is no longer required for our existing operations 
should these estimates not reflect actual results in future periods  we adjust the provision through the income statement

the length of one of the contracts is five and one half years and the other contract is one year 
the contracts automatically renew at the end of each term unless notice is given by one of the parties 
these agreements generated thousand per quarter starting in the fourth quarter of for the banking practice and increasing to million per quarter starting in the third quarter of  of which  thousand is for the banking practice and thousand is for the executive benefits practice 
first year commission revenue in included million related to an agreement with another insurance carrier  which was executed in under the thirty year agreement  renewal revenues have also been affected each quarter since execution of the agreement with approximately million of revenue reflected in the year ended december  the expected revenue streams are based on our existing inforce business with these carriers  and would be negatively impacted by potential future surrenders of the inforce business or non renewal of the agreements and positively impacted by asset growth of our business with these carriers 
commission expense 
commission and fee expense was million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december   versus million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the reduction in commission expense as a percentage of revenue reflects an increase in the percentage of revenue generated from employee consultants

the acquisition of longmiller added approximately million of amortization expense in as a result of a full year of amortization of the net present value of inforce revenue and non compete agreements 
the results included one month of amortization related to this intangible asset 
settlement of litigation 
during the year ended december   we received million from a favorable lawsuit settlement 
human capital practice reorganization 
in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our executive compensation consulting practices 
as part of the reorganization  some of the operations and employees of the human capital practice were transferred to the pearl meyer partners practice 
in addition  several partners and staff members were terminated which resulted in exiting certain activities of the practice and creating unused leased office space in numerous cities 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of relating to the reorganization  of which  million remains on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  no similar costs were recorded in other income 
for the years ended december  and  we received rental income of approximately thousand and thousand  respectively from several subtenants 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in to finance the november acquisition of longmiller  we borrowed approximately million on our line of credit and issued million of non recourse insurance revenue asset backed notes

income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million  at an effective tax rate of  compared to million at an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  reflects thousand of net state tax refunds relating to prior years 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the true up of the estimated state tax liability 
we expect a normalized effective income tax rate of approximately in future periods

revenue growth was also strong in the healthcare group  which benefited from increased first year commission and fee revenue 
revenue in was positively impacted by approximately million with the february acquisition of federal policy group  which provides tax and legislative consulting services 
new business revenue includes million received pursuant to an administrative services agreement and bonus forfeiture agreement with an insurance carrier with which a significant amount of inforce insurance is in place see carrier incentive contracts below 
our executive benefits practice ebp experienced a decline in revenue from million in to million in as a result of economic conditions and proposed legislation related to the structure of deferred compensation plans that has caused clients to delay implementing new deferred compensation plans 
these circumstances may continue in future periods and adversely affect our ability to generate future revenue in ebp 
commission expense 
commission and fee expense was million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december   versus million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  this reduction in the percentage of commission expense as a percentage of revenue reflects an increased proportion of revenue from fee based consulting activity in as well as an increase in the percentage of revenue generated from employee consultants 
we expect the acquisition of longmiller to result in a greater percentage of commission expense as a percentage of revenue in the future 
fee based consulting activity accounted for of revenue compared to of revenue 
included in commission expense is thousand of non cash expense recognized in from performance based stock options issued to non employee producers 
such expenses may be incurred in the future if certain non employee producers achieve specified targets 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the increase is attributed to the expanded staffing of sales consultants and support services company wide and expenses associated with recent acquisitions

amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the prior year period 
the reduction in amortization expense resulted from the january adoption of sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill  offset by amortization related to identifiable intangibles through acquisitions in for the year ended december   amortization expense included million pre tax attributed to goodwill amortization 
the acquisition of longmiller added approximately million of amortization expense in  as a result of a full year s of amortization of the net present value of inforce revenue and non compete agreements 
we acquired approximately million of inforce revenue with our november acquisition of longmiller and the results include one month of amortization related to this intangible asset 
other income

during  we received thousand of life insurance proceeds as the result of the death of one of our employees  and rental income from a tenant of thousand 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in in  we recorded interest expense of approximately million as a result of interest rate swap settlements associated with the pay off of our outstanding bank debt with the proceeds from our secondary equity offering

income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million at an effective tax rate of compared to million at an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was affected by the filing of an amended federal tax return during the third quarter which reduced the overall tax rate

 for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted common share versus net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december  the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding increased to million shares for the year ended december  from million shares for the year ended december  acquisition strategy our acquisition criteria focuses on the quality of the management  future earnings and the strategic fit with our company  as well as the growth potential of the target company 
in several of our acquisitions  we also acquire the financial value embedded in a book of recurring renewal business that is expected to be realized for many years after the acquisition takes place 
up until now  our future renewal revenue stream has been the source of collateral for our line of credit  which we frequently use for acquisitions 
as we acquire more businesses that do not have this attribute  this may limit our future borrowing availability 
we typically structure a majority of the purchase price in cash 
we acquire little in the way of tangible assets  thus creating a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet 
the companies we acquire are frequently privately owned and structured as subchapter s corporations and the acquisitions are usually effected through a purchase of assets with the income taxed directly to the stockholders 
from time to time we are involved in negotiations relating to the acquisition of companies in our industry or related industries 
some of these negotiations could involve companies whose acquisition would be highly material to our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs in connection with negotiating such transactions  even if the transactions are not completed 
human capital practice reorganization in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our executive compensation consulting practices 
as part of the reorganization  some of the operations and employees of the human capital practice were transferred to the pearl meyer partners practice 
in addition  four partners and six staff members were terminated which resulted in exiting certain activities of the practice and creating unused leased office space in numerous cities 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of relating to the reorganization of which million remains on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  as a result of the restructuring  we expect to leverage the pearl meyer partners brand name for executive compensation consulting  eliminate confusion in the marketplace regarding our practices and their markets  and significantly lower the cost structure for the remaining human capital practice 
the remaining business of the human capital practice consists of actuarial retirement plan and investment advisory services 
see note  human capital practice to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
carrier incentive contracts during the third quarter of  we completed agreements with two of our insurance carriers  which will generate additional revenue on our existing blocks of business with these carriers 
the length of one of the contracts is five and one half years and the other contract is one year 
the contracts automatically renew at the end of each term unless notice is given by one of the parties 
the agreements resulted in revenue of million in the third quarter  and thousand in the fourth quarter  and provide for additional payments upon certain conditions and measurement dates 
the future payment amounts are based on the cash value or fair value of our existing inforce business with these carriers at specified dates of measurement and are projected at approximately million per year 
future payment amounts would be negatively impacted by potential future surrenders of the inforce business or non renewal of the agreements and positively impacted by asset growth of these contracts 
on september   we entered into an administrative services agreement and bonus forfeiture agreement with an affiliate of ausa holding  inc  one of our principal stockholders and insurance carrier 
we received approximately million of payments in related to this agreement 
during  we received million for services rendered prior to and through september  and recognized a total of million of revenue in  pursuant to this agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  we expect to continue to receive approximately million annually from the carrier for a period of years  depending upon certain conditions 
of this annual amount million is included in the cash flows securitizing the asset backed notes issued to finance the acquisition of longmiller  and we will not have access to this cash for general corporate purposes until the securitized notes are fully paid 
this revenue  net of amounts provided for chargebacks  is being recognized on a monthly basis beginning in october the amounts received are subject to chargeback reimbursement of a portion of amounts received if any policies under this agreement are surrendered or exchanged 
any chargeback amounts would be deducted from the next scheduled payment 
recent developments tax and legislative initiatives in recent years  the internal revenue service irs has undertaken a major enforcement initiative to disallow the interest deductions on certain leveraged business owned life insurance programs sold during or prior to the irs has prevailed on the cases it has litigated to date related to this initiative and recently made a temporary now expired public settlement offer to address ongoing cases 
while we stopped selling leveraged business owned life insurance programs after and we do not expect any material adverse impact on our revenue from this enforcement initiative  it is impossible to determine the impact of this initiative on a client s decision to continue or surrender an existing leveraged business owned life insurance program 
there have been several recent legislative proposals to change the federal tax laws with respect to business owned life insurance 
on september   the senate finance committee approved legislation proposed by sen 
jeff bingaman d nm that would tax the death benefits taxpayers receive from certain policies on the lives of former employees 
following an intensive lobbying effort by the insurance industry  the finance committee on february   reconsidered the business owned life insurance provision it had previously approved and  in its place  approved legislation that generally would tax the death benefits taxpayers receive from policies on the lives of employees or former employees only in cases where the insured person had not consented to being covered or in the case of a former employee  or where the insured was not among the company s highly compensated employees at the time of policy issuance 
we believe that this most recent proposal  if enacted  would not have a material adverse effect on our revenue from the sale of business owned life insurance policies 
however  if congress were to adopt legislation broadly limiting the tax free payment of death benefits on such policies or otherwise adversely affecting the tax treatment of the policies  future revenue from sale of business owned life insurance policies could materially decline 
change in insurable interest laws there have been several recent proposals in various states eg  georgia  texas  and washington to change the insurable interest and other state laws governing the ability of an employer to purchase or hold life insurance on the lives of employees 
california has recently enacted legislation prohibiting the purchase of business owned life insurance on the lives of employees not exempt from wage and hour laws a group of employees not typically insured under the arrangements we market 
significant segments of the life insurance industry are engaged in an ongoing  intensive effort to prevent the enactment of state law changes that would have an adverse impact on business owned life insurance 
if one or more states were to adopt proposals broadly limiting the ability of employers to purchase or hold life insurance on the lives of employees  the market for these policies would be reduced and a number of existing policies could be surrendered or exchanged  with a resulting reduction in our revenues from these arrangements 
segment results the following analysis depicts the results of each of our operating segments on a stand alone basis 
the practices are allocated a charge to cover centralized resource center expenditures in the areas of human resources  marketing  and information technology

renewal revenue for the year ended december  includes million related to the administrative services agreement entered into on september  with an affiliate of ausa holding  inc along with million in first year revenue from the execution of contracts with two other insurance carriers during with interest rates remaining at very low historical levels  there is some uncertainty about sustaining revenue growth due to product appeal  product capacity  and pricing concerns 
approximately million of the increase in renewal revenue is attributable to the securitized inforce revenue stream from the acquisition of longmiller 
commission expense for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the same period in the commission expense as a percentage of revenue continues to decrease as a result of a higher percentage of first year revenue produced by employee consultants

total first year commission revenue increased to million and total revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
these increases reflect significant sales growth in the community bank market  and include only limited contribution from the large bank market  which has been more adversely affected by the low interest rate environment

based on our historically strong operating cash flow and revolving credit facility  we believe we have little need to maintain substantial cash balances 
we use net cash from operating activities primarily to fund capital expenditures  small acquisitions  and service existing debt 
we expect large cash outlays and future acquisitions will be financed primarily through externally available funds 
however  we can offer no assurance such funds will be available and  if so  on terms acceptable to us

cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   million was used for acquisitions and million was used for purchases of equipment 
a substantial portion of the purchase price used to fund acquisitions has historically been paid in cash 
this is primarily due to our desire to avoid diluting our existing stockholders 
we expect acquisitions to continue and be financed primarily from available credit lines and possible additional equity 
however  we can offer no assurances such will be the case 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december   approximately million of cash was used primarily million for the net repayment of borrowings 
as of december   there was restricted cash of approximately million  an increase of million from december   which will be used to pay down the asset backed notes issued to finance the acquisition of longmiller

at december   we converted million of the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility to term debt 
the term debt is being paid quarterly over five years under the facility agreement 
we had million available under our credit line at december  our restrictive covenants may limit our borrowing ability under our credit line 
the restrictive covenants under the credit agreement provide for the maintenance of a minimum ratio of fixed charges  a maximum allowable leverage ratio  a minimum amount of net worth stockholders equity  and a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  we believe that our cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide sufficient funds to service our debt obligations 
however  as our business grows  our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will also continue to increase 
there can be no assurance that the net cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow requirements or that we will not require additional debt or equity financing in the future 
we may issue stock to finance future acquisitions

inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
certain of our expenses  such as compensation  benefits  and capital equipment costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures
