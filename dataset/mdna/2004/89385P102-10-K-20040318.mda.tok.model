significant operating trends revenues  particularly in the latter half of the year  were negatively impacted by higher than expected unseated tractors tractors owned by the company for which no driver is available to assign and the limited availability of owner operator capacity 
while the hiring market has tightened significantly  the company has taken actions that it expects will address these trends  including increasing driver pay rates 
new hours of service hos rules went into effect at the beginning of and the company is committed to ensuring that its drivers do not bear the financial burden of the more restrictive limits on hours of service  accordingly  it has announced an increase in the accessorial pay for the drivers and has negotiated new accessorial charges for customer events that have the effect of decreasing asset and driver productivity 
the company is also proactively working with customers to eliminate inefficiencies in their supply chain network 
the year was a year of significant change resulting from a rebuilding of the fundamentals of transport america 
the company focused on achieving its strategic priorities of operational excellence  organizational excellence  and consistent profitable growth

the company also made significant improvement in its business fundamentals throughout  improving tractor and trailer utilization as measured by revenue per unit per week in spite of the higher number of unseated tractors during the latter half of the year and reducing the percentage of deadhead miles from levels 
ongoing cost reduction efforts continue to make transport america more competitive and administrative productivity continued to improve in the company initiated a broad cost reduction initiative across the organization and has reduced salaries and wages  maintenance costs  accident claim costs  depreciation and other general and administrative costs 
two service center facilities that did not fit the company s network were closed  one of these facilities was sold and the proceeds were used to further reduce debt 
the company eliminated redundant functions throughout other service centers and increased maintenance capabilities to provide maintenance services to its owner operators 
the sales department successfully secured new opportunities that continue to drive density and balance in our network  and we are attaining increased freight rates as we better manage the network and customer mix

transport corporation of america  inc 
outlook looking forward  the company expects the rate environment to remain strong throughout fiscal an improving economy and limited driver availability will continue to put pressure on truckload capacity 
sequentially  the company has experienced four quarters in a row of increased rates and expects this trend to continue into the company does expect some of its costs to increase in the tight driver market will put upward pressure on driver hiring expenses  insurance costs will continue to increase  and tractor replacements in will be required to comply with new epa standards that will lead to increased depreciation expenses and reduced fuel efficiency 
new hours of service rules came into effect in january the company believes it is minimizing the impact of the new hours of service rules through proactive planning  however  the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the new hours of service rules 
these changes could have an adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
effective january  the company increased its accessorial charges to customers for multiple stop shipments and its rates for equipment detention 
the company also raised its driver stop pay and driver detention pay 
the biggest challenge for the company and the industry is seated capacity since the market for new drivers has tightened significantly 
the company has implemented several programs to boost its recruiting efforts and increase the seated fleet percentage 
regulations the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa of the us department of transportation issued a final rule on april  that made several changes to the regulations that govern truck drivers hours of service 
under the new rules  loading unloading delays and shipments that require multiple stop deliveries may be affected as the new rules may limit drivers available hours 
the new rules became effective on january  and the company continues to evaluate the new rules to determine the effect they may have on its operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the financial statements attached hereto 
other footnotes describe various elements of the financial statements and the assumptions on which specific amounts were determined 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the presentation of the financial condition or results of operations 
the company s critical accounting policies include the following revenue equipment  property  and other equipment 
revenue equipment  property  and other equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation  including amortization of capitalized leases  is computed using the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease periods  whichever is shorter 
as part of a purchase program with a tractor manufacturer  the company has obtained residual value guarantees for a significant portion of its tractors 
management must make significant estimates regarding the useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
a ten percent decrease in estimated salvage values on tractors and trailers would have decreased the company s net revenue equipment as of december  by approximately million 
estimated liability for insurance claims 
management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage  and cargo damage claims 
in the month claims are reported  the company estimates and establishes a liability for its share of ultimate settlements using all available information  coupled with the company s history of such claims 
claim estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes available 
the recorded expense depends upon actual loss experience and changes in estimates of settlement amounts for open claims that have not been fully resolved 
however  final settlement of these claims could differ materially from the amounts the company has accrued at year end 
if the accident and property claims settlement experience worsened by ten percent  the estimated outstanding loss reserves as of december  would have needed to increase by approximately million 
if the workers compensation settlement experience worsened by ten percent the outstanding loss reserves as of december  would have needed to increase by approximately million

impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell
