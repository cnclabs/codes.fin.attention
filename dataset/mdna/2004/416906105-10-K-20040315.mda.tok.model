item business 
overview harvard bioscience  a delaware corporation  is a global developer  manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of specialized products  primarily scientific instruments  used to accelerate drug discovery research at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories worldwide 
we sell our products to thousands of researchers in over countries through our direct sales force  our  page catalog and various other specialty catalogs  and through distributors  including amersham biosciences  fisher scientific and cole parmer 
we have sales and manufacturing operations in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  austria and belgium with sales facilities in france and canada 
our history our business began in under the name harvard apparatus and has grown over the intervening years with the development and evolution of modern drug discovery tools 
our early inventions include the mechanical syringe pump in the s for drug infusion and the microprocessor controlled syringe pump in the s 
in march  a group of investors led by our current management team acquired a majority of the then existing business of our predecessor  harvard apparatus 
following this acquisition  we redirected the focus of the company to participate in the high growth areas  or bottlenecks  within drug discovery by acquiring and licensing innovative technologies while continuing to grow the existing business through internal product development and marketing  partnerships and acquisitions 
through december   we have completed business acquisitions  internally developed new product lines including new generation syringe pumps  ventilators  dna rna protein calculators  spectrophotometers  plate readers  a multi well plate version of our btx electroporation product  the hummingbird system for liquid dispensing  our microscope image automation system mias for high content screening and improved versions of our copas model organism screening platform 
our strategy our mission is to profitably accelerate drug discovery 
our goal is to become a leading provider in the tools for the drug discovery industry 
our strategy is to have a broad range of specialized products currently over  in strong positions in niche markets focused on the bottlenecks in drug discovery research by having a broad product line  we believe we reduce the risk of being dependent on a single technology in an industry characterized by very rapid technological change  by having specialized products in niche markets  we seek to reduce head to head competition with the major instrument companies  and by focusing on the bottlenecks  we believe we position ourselves for above average revenue growth and above average margins 
we grow this range of products through internal development of new products  acquisitions and strategic partnerships with both pharmaceutical companies for new product development and other major life science companies for expanded distribution 
we also use acquisitions to expand our product line because we believe we can use our well established brands and distribution channels to accelerate the growth of these acquired products 
we also believe that our expertise in operational management frequently allows us to improve profitability at acquired companies 
our products today  our broad product range is generally targeted towards four major application areas admet screening  molecular biology  automation of genomics and proteomics experiments  and high throughput high content screening of potential drugs 
admet screening 
the goal of admet screening is to identify compounds that have toxic side effects or undesirable pharmacological properties 
these pharmacological properties consist of absorption  distribution  metabolism and elimination  which together with toxicology  form the acronym admet 
we have a wide range of products that our customers use to help their researchers conduct better experiments on cells  tissues  organs and animals 
these products are primarily sold under the harvard apparatus  btx  medical systems  clark electromedical  navicyte  hugo sachs elektronik and warner instruments brand names 
the individual sales prices of these products are often under  but when combined into systems such as the hugo sachs isolated organ system the total sales price can be over  they are typically sold through our catalogs and website with support from technical specialists  although btx products are primarily sold through distributors 
some of these products are described below absorption navicyte diffusion chambers a diffusion chamber is a small plastic chamber with a membrane separating the two halves of the chamber used to measure the absorption of a drug into the bloodstream 
the membrane can either be tissue such as intestinal tissue or a cultured layer of cells such as human colon cells 
this creates a miniaturized model of intestinal absorption 
we entered this market with our acquisition of the assets of navicyte inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of trega biosciences 
distribution well equilibrium dialysis plate for serum protein binding assays our well equilibrium dialysis plate contains pairs of chambers with each pair separated by a membrane 
the protein target is placed on one side of the membrane and the drug on the other 
the small molecule drug diffuses through the membrane 
if it binds to the target  it cannot diffuse back again 
if it does not bind  it will diffuse back and forth until equilibrium is established 
once equilibrium is established  the concentration of the drug can be measured thereby indicating the strength of the binding 
this product is principally used for admet screening to determine if a drug binds to blood proteins 
a certain level of reversible binding is advantageous in order to promote good distribution of a drug through the human body 
however  if the binding is too strong  it may impair normal protein function and cause toxic effects 
metabolism and elimination organ testing systems organ testing systems use glass or plastic chambers together with stimulators and recording electrodes to study organ function 
organ testing systems enable either whole organs or strips of tissue from organs such as hearts  livers and lungs to be kept functioning outside the body while researchers perform experiments with them 
they are typically used in place of live animals 
studies on isolated livers are useful in determining metabolism and studies on kidneys are useful in determining elimination 
we have sold basic versions of these systems for many years  but significantly expanded our product offerings through our acquisition of hugo sachs elektronik 
toxicology precision infusion pumps infusion pumps  typically syringe pumps  are used to accurately infuse very small quantities of liquid  commonly drugs 
infusion pumps are generally used for long term toxicology testing of drugs by infusion into animals  usually laboratory rats 
we sell a wide range of different types of syringe pumps 
cell injection systems cell injection systems use extremely fine bore glass capillaries to penetrate and inject drugs into or around individual cells 
cell injection systems are used to study the effects of drugs on single cells 
injection is accomplished either with air pressure or  if the drug molecule is electrically charged  by applying an electric current 
we entered this market with our acquisition of the research products of medical systems corporation and considerably expanded our presence in this market with our acquisitions of clark electromedical instruments in and warner instruments in ventilators ventilators use a piston driven air pump to inflate the lungs of an anesthestized animal 
ventilators are typically used in surgical procedures common in drug discovery 
our advanced inspira ventilators have significant safety and ease of use features  such as default safety settings 
we expanded our product line with the minivent acquired as part of our acquisition of hugo sachs elektronik in and expanded our presence in anesthesia with our acquisition of ims in electroporation products acquired with our purchase of the btx division of genetronics biomedical corporation in january  our electroporation products include systems and generators  electrodes and accessories for research applications including in vivo  in ovo and in vitro gene delivery  electrocell fusion and nuclear transfer cloning 
through the application of precise pulsed electrical signals  electroporation systems open small pores in cell membranes allowing genes and or drugs to pass through the cell membranes 
the principal advantages of electroporation over other transfection techniques are speed  and the fact that electroporation does not require harsh chemicals that can interfere or change cell function 
in addition to our proprietary manufactured products  we buy and resell  through our catalog  products that are made by other manufacturers 
we have negotiated supply agreements with the majority of the companies that provide our distributed products 
these supply agreements specify pricing only and contain no minimum purchase commitments 
each of these agreements represented less than one percent of our revenues for the year ended december  distributed products accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  these distributed products enable us to provide our customers with a single source for their experimental needs 
these complementary products consist of a large variety of devices  instruments and consumable items used in experiments involving cells  tissues  organs and animals in the fields of proteomics  physiology  pharmacology  neuroscience  cell biology  molecular biology and toxicology 
we believe that our proprietary manufactured products are often leaders in their fields  however  researchers often need complementary products in order to conduct particular experiments 
most of these complementary products come from small companies that do not have our extensive distribution and marketing capabilities 
molecular biology 
these products are primarily sold under brand names of the distributors including amersham biosciences 
they are mainly scientific instruments such as spectrophotometers and plate readers that analyze light to detect and quantify a wide range of molecular and cellular processes or apparatus such as gel electrophoresis units 
these products are typically in the  to  price range 
they are typically sold through distributors 
molecular biology spectrophotometers a spectrophotometer is an instrument widely used in molecular biology and cell biology to quantify the amount of a compound in a sample by shining a beam of white light through a prism or grating to divide it into component wavelengths 
each wavelength in turn is shone through a liquid sample and the spectrophotometer measures the amount of light absorbed at each wavelength 
this enables the quantification of the amount of a compound in a sample 
we sell a wide range of spectrophotometers under the names ultrospec  novaspec and biowave 
these products are manufactured by our biochrom subsidiary and sold primarily through our distribution arrangement with amersham biosciences 
dna rna protein calculators a dna rna protein calculator is a bench top instrument dedicated to quantifying the amount of dna  rna or protein in a sample 
it uses a process similar to that of a molecular biology spectrophotometer 
these are sold under the names genequant and genequant pro 
launched in  we believe that it was the first such instrument sold 
these products are manufactured by our biochrom subsidiary and sold primarily through amersham biosciences 
multi well plate readers multi well plate readers are widely used for high throughput screening assays in the drug discovery process 
the most common format is wells per plate 
plate readers use light to detect chemical interactions 
we introduced a range of these products in beginning with absorbance readers and followed by luminescence readers 
these products are sold through amersham biosciences and other distributors 
amino acid analysis systems an amino acid analysis system uses chromatography to separate the amino acids in a sample and then uses a chemical reaction to detect each one in turn as they flow out of the chromatography column 
amino acids are the building blocks of proteins 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the amino acid analysis systems business of the biotronik subsidiary of eppendorf netheler hinz gmbh and integrated it with the existing amino acid analysis systems business in our biochrom subsidiary 
these systems are sold through our biochrom direct sales force and through distributors including amersham biosciences 
low volume  high throughput liquid dispensers a liquid dispenser dispenses low volumes of liquids into high density microtitre plates used in high throughput screening processes in drug discovery 
our unique technology enables dispensing to take place without the need for contact between the droplet and the liquid already present in the plate  thereby removing any risk of cross contamination from the process 
these products are primarily marketed by our asys hitech subsidiary and sold under distributor brand names 
we acquired asys hitech in december through our biochrom subsidiary 
asys hitech develops and markets both the liquid dispensers and a line of oem plate readers 
for ultra low volume dispensing we sell the cartesian technologies systems discussed under high throughput screening 
gel electrophoresis systems gel electrophoresis is a method for separating and purifying dna  rna and proteins 
in gel electrophoresis an electric current is run through a thin slab of gel and the dna  rna or protein molecules separate out based on their charge and size 
the gel is contained in a plastic tank with an associated power supply 
most of these products were acquired with our november acquisition of scieplas ltd 
and are sold through distributors 
we greatly expanded our range of gel electrophoresis products with our november acquisition of hoefer 
the majority of hoefer revenues are expected to come from a distribution partnership with amersham biosciences but we are also establishing a catalog distribution channel under the hoefer name 
automating genomics and proteomics experiments 
these products were mainly acquired with our purchase of genomic solutions inc in october  our acquisition of genemachines in march and our acquisition of biorobotics in september they are mainly large scientific instruments that rapidly process and analyze samples of dna  rna or proteins 
these systems are typically over  each and are sold by our field sales force and by distributors in select countries 
genomics products arrayers  hybridization workstations and scanners genes contain the dna code for making proteins 
the human genome contains over three billion letters of dna code that are organized into approximately  genes that can create approximately  proteins 
scientists have studied individual genes for decades but the modern discipline of genomics refers to studying many genes simultaneously 
genes are often studied using microarrays by glass slides covered in many spots  each spot containing a unique piece of known dna 
a sample labeled with a fluorescent dye is then washed over the slide and the dna in the sample that sticks to the dna on the slide by virtue of the complementary pairing of dna bases is identified 
we make arraying instruments that can precisely spot down onto the slide tiny quantities of dna and enable large numbers of slides to be automatically manufactured by the scientists 
our hybridization workstations carefully control the addition of reagents and the reaction conditions that enable the automated washing of the sample over the slide to create a robust attachment of the sample dna to the test dna 
our slide scanners use lasers to read the intensity of the fluorescent signals to accurately quantify the genes that are present in the sample 
finally  we developed the software to control the process and analyze the data 
these products are mainly sold under our genemachines brand name 
proteomics products dimensional gels  spot picking robots and sample preparation robots proteins are a key component of all living cells 
each cell may contain thousands of different proteins 
scientists have studied individual proteins for decades but the modern discipline of proteomics refers to studying many proteins simultaneously 
in order to study proteins they must first be purified 
we manufacture two dimensional electrophoresis gels and related apparatus for purifying proteins 
gel electrophoresis uses electric current to separate molecules by size and amount of electric charge they carry 
these gels are then processed by automated workstations that use machine vision and robotics to remove individual protein spots from the gels 
these spots are further purified using proprietary sample preparation pipette tips combined with robotics to automatically spot the pure proteins onto plates that can be analyzed by mass spectrometers 
the data from all these processes can then be analyzed and presented by our powerful software 
by automating these otherwise manual processes  our products make proteomics approaches practical 
these products are mainly sold under our investigator brand name and also under our scieplas  hoefer and amika brand names 
high throughput high content screening 
high throughput screening high throughput screening is the process of testing large numbers often hundreds of thousands of potential drug molecules on proteins that are thought to be involved in disease 
we manufacture instruments that aspirate and dispense very small quantities as small as billionths of a liter of chemicals into test wells usually either  or on small plastic plates called microtitre plates 
we make instruments that can very rapidly  precisely and without cross contamination add the same compound to each well  or add a different compound to each well 
these products are mainly sold under our cartesian technologies and asys hitech brand names 
in addition  specialized versions of our copas systems can be used for high throughput screening of potential drug molecules as well as high throughput high content screening of model organisms 
high content screening copas systems these systems are large scientific instruments that use fluid flow and lasers to analyze small model organisms like nematode worms  fruit flies and fish very rapidly and in large numbers 
model organisms are so called because they are used to model human diseases 
the copas tm system uses large bore flow cytometry and a novel proprietary technique to rapidly analyze and sort the model organisms c 
elegans worm  d 
melanogaster fly  and d 
rerio zebra fish 
automation of the handling of these organisms through the use of the copas tm system provides scientists a complete integrated solution to rapidly sort and evaluate model organisms 
copas systems are typically over  in price and are sold by technically specialized salespeople 
in may  we acquired union biometrica  the inventor and developer of the copas tm technology 
mias microscope image automation systems our mias product is an automated microscope that uses a night vision camera and advanced image processing algorithms to obtain useful biological information from images of cells  tissues or model organisms 
it does this in a highly automated way that enables both high content and high throughput assays for the effects of drugs on cells  tissues or organisms 
high content screening is a natural evolution from high throughput screening and is still a relatively new concept 
in high content screening  photographs of the cells are taken and multiple data points such as cell size  shape  color  texture and the location and intensity of the expression of specific genes or proteins are all collected simultaneously 
this is in contrast to traditional high throughput screening where the only information obtained is whether or not a potential drug bound to or chemically interacted with its protein target 
mias was developed by us under contracts with a major pharmaceutical company and a smaller biotechnology company 
the first commercial instrument was delivered in the fourth quarter of our customers our end user customers are primarily research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories  including the us national institutes of health  or nih 
our largest customers include glaxo smithkline  pfizer  merck co  university of alabama  university at zurich  national taiwan university  allegheny singer research institute  university of reading  university of alberta and benchmark services 
we conduct direct sales in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  france  belgium  spain  the netherlands and canada 
we also maintain distributors in other countries 
aggregate sales to our largest customer  amersham biosciences  a distributor with end users similar to ours  accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  compared to approximately for the year ended december  we have several thousand customers worldwide and no other customer accounted for more than two percent of our revenues for such period 
sales and marketing for the year ended december   revenues from direct sales to end users through our harvard apparatus catalog represented approximately of our revenues  revenues from direct sales to end users through our direct sales force represented approximately of our total revenues  and revenues of our products through distributors represented approximately of our revenues 
direct sales we periodically produce and mail a harvard apparatus full line catalog which contains approximately  products on  pages and is printed in varying quantities ranging from  to  copies 
the catalog  which is accessible on our website  serves as the primary sales tool for the harvard apparatus product line range which includes both proprietary manufactured products and complementary products from various suppliers 
our leadership position in many of our manufactured products creates traffic to the catalog and website and enables cross selling and facilitates the introduction of new products 
in addition to the comprehensive catalog  we create and mail abridged catalogs that focus on specific product areas along with direct mailers and targeted e mailers  which introduce or promote new products 
we distribute the majority of our products ordered from our catalog  through our worldwide subsidiaries 
in those regions where we do not have a subsidiary  or for products which we have acquired  that had distributors in place at the time of our acquisition as the distribution channel  we use distributors 
as a result of our acquisition of union biometrica in  the increased direct sales in the us of our biochrom amino acid analyzer  our acquisition of genomic solutions in  and our acquisitions of genemachines and biorobotics in  a significant portion of our revenues is now attributable to a direct sales force and support organization rather than to a catalog or distributor sales 
our direct sales force is complemented in the field by our technical support and field service organizations  and together they effectively sell and service our capital equipment product lines such as the copas product line  the biochrom amino acid analyzer and the genomic solutions genomics  proteomics  and high throughput screening product lines 
although there are separate and distinct sales forces for each of these product lines  we are able to leverage our capabilities by having more individuals able to connect with and identify prospective customers 
the mias product is still in a start up phase and we expect the sales to be both direct to scientists and through oems 
distributors in august  we entered into a new agreement with amersham biosciences 
under the terms of the agreement amersham biosciences serves as our exclusive distributor  marketer and seller of a majority of our spectrophotometer and dna rna calculator product lines of our biochrom subsidiary 
this agreement has a five year finite life and may be terminated by either party upon months prior written notice 
additionally  upon breach of certain terms of the agreement  such as pricing  exclusivity and delivery  by either party  the agreement may be terminated with a day notice period 
in november  in connection with the acquisition of hoefer from amersham biosciences  we entered into a separate distribution agreement with amersham biosciences for the distribution of the hoefer products 
this contract has a ten year term  provides for minimum purchases for the first three years  allows us to use the hoefer name which we acquired in the transaction on direct sales by us to end users or through other distributors  and may be terminated after five years with a one year advance notice 
additionally  upon breach of certain terms of the agreement  such as pricing and delivery  by either party the agreement may be terminated with a day notice period 
in addition to engaging amersham biosciences as the primary distributor for our biochrom and hoefer products  we also engage distributors for the sales of harvard apparatus  biochronn  union biometrica and genomic solutions products in certain areas of the world and in certain product specific situations 
in those regions where we do not have a subsidiary  and for products which we have acquired that had distributors in place as the distribution channel at the time of our acquisition  we use distributors 
research and development our principal research and development mission is to develop a broad portfolio of technologies  products and core competencies in drug discovery tools  particularly for application in the areas of admet screening  molecular biology  genomics  proteomics and high throughput high content screening 
our research and development expenditures were million  million excluding in process research and development charges of million and million excluding in process research and development charges of million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant development expenditures as we deem appropriate given the circumstances at such time 
we plan to continue to pursue a balanced development portfolio strategy of originating new products from internal research and development programs and acquiring products through business and technology acquisitions 
enhancements to copas and the development of new applications for copas  the development of the second generation of mias  the development of the hummingbird liquid dispensing instrument and the development of the multi well plate for the btx electroporation products were our significant development projects in we maintain development staff in most of our manufacturing facilities to design and develop new products and also to re engineer existing products to bring them to the next generation level 
in house development is focused on our current technologies 
our european research laboratory in geel  belgium is focusing on extending the use of and developing new applications for high throughput automated microscope imaging 
for major new technologies  our strategy has been to partner with universities  government labs or pharmaceutical companies to develop technology into commercially viable products 
manufacturing we manufacture and test the majority of our products in our principal manufacturing facilities located in the united states  the united kingdom  austria  belgium and germany 
we have considerable manufacturing flexibility at our various facilities  and each facility can manufacture multiple products at the same time 
we maintain in house key manufacturing know how  technologies and resources 
we seek to maintain multiple suppliers for key components that are not manufactured in house  and while some of our products are dependent on sole source suppliers  we do not believe our dependence upon these suppliers creates any significant risks 
our manufacturing operations are primarily to assemble and test 
our manufacturing of syringe pumps  ventilators  cell injectors  protein purification products and electroporation products takes place in holliston  massachusetts 
the manufacture of our cell biology and electrophysiology products takes place in both our holliston  massachusetts facility and our hamden  connecticut facility 
the copas technology instruments are manufactured in our somerville  massachusetts facility 
our genomics  proteomics and high throughput screening products are manufactured at our irvine and san carlos  california and huntingdon  england facilities 
our manufacturing of spectrophotometers and amino acid analysis systems takes place in our cambridge  england facility which is certified to iso our manufacturing of surgery and anesthesia related products and teaching products takes place in edenbridge  england 
our manufacturing of complete organ testing systems takes place in march hugstetten  germany 
our electrophoresis products are manufactured at our warwickshire  england facility and our san francisco  california facility 
our low volume  high throughput liquid dispensers and our plate readers are manufactured in our facility in eugendorf  austria 
our mias products are manufactured at our facility in geel  belgium 
competition the markets into which we sell our products are highly competitive  and we expect the intensity of competition to continue or increase 
we compete with many companies engaged in developing and selling tools for drug discovery 
many of our competitors have greater financial  operational  sales and marketing resources  and more experience in research and development and commercialization than we have 
moreover  our competitors may have greater name recognition than we do  and many offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
these competitors and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products which could render our products obsolete 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make the enhancements to our technologies necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
we are not aware of any significant products sold by us which are currently obsolete 
we believe that we offer one of the broadest selections of products to companies engaged in drug discovery 
we are not aware of any competitor that offers a product line of comparable breadth across our target markets 
we have numerous competitors on a product line basis 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of product performance  including quality  reliability and speed  technical support  price and delivery time 
we compete with several companies that provide instruments for admet screening  molecular biology  genomics  proteomics  high throughput screening  and high content screening 
in the admet screening area  we compete with  among others  razel scientific instruments  inc  kent scientific corporation  general valve corp  eppendorf netheler hinz gmbh  ugo basile and becton  dickinson and company 
in the molecular biology products  we compete with  among others  bio rad laboratories  inc  perkinelmer  inc  invitrogen corporation  beckman coulter  inc  thermo electron corporation  and molecular devices corporation 
in the genomics and proteomics area  we compete with  among others  genetix  ltd  amersham biosciences corp  axon instruments  inc  bio rad laboratories  inc  agilent technologies  inc  bruker biosciences corporation  perkinelmer  inc and affymetrix  inc in the high throughput high content screening area we compete with  among others  genetix  ltd  amersham biosciences corp  cellomics  inc  atto bioscience  inc  perkinelmer  inc  zymark corporation  tecan group  beckman coulter  inc  apogent technologies  inc  agilent technologies  inc  and innovadyne technologies  inc 
for our copas product line  we compete primarily against manual techniques rather than a specific tools provider 
intellectual property to establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts 
many of our new technologies are covered by patents or patent applications 
most of our more mature product lines are protected by trade names and trade secrets only 
we have implemented a patent strategy designed to provide us with freedom to operate and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products 
we currently own issued us patents and have pending applications 
generally  us patents have a term of years from the date of issue for patents issued from applications filed with the us patent office prior to june   and years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date in the case of patents issued from applications filed on or after june  our issued us patents will expire between and our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as we develop new products and technologies 
patents provide some degree of protection for our intellectual property 
however  the assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is therefore uncertain 
the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection 
in addition  our issued patents or patents licensed to us may be successfully challenged  invalidated  circumvented or unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition  the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve  particularly in areas of interest to us 
as a result  there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us 
in view of these factors  our intellectual property positions bear some degree of uncertainty 
we also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties  employees and consultants 
our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
although many of our us employees have signed agreements not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and after termination of their employment  through the misuse of confidential information  soliciting employees  soliciting customers and the like  these types of agreements cannot be legally entered into in europe or in california 
in addition  it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and if so  there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available 
despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that third parties will not independently discover or invent competing technologies  or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technologies 
therefore  the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
we do not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party 
we cannot assure you  however  that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors with respect to current or future products and third parties have made such claims 
we expect that product developers in our market will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our market segment grows and the product functionality in different market segments overlaps 
in addition  patents on production and business methods are becoming more common and we expect that more patents will be issued in our technical field 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
moreover  such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could seriously harm our business or financial condition

item legal proceedings 
in september   our genomic solutions subsidiary filed suit against affymetrix  inc in the state of michigan circuit court for the county of washtenaw for breach of contract  negligent innocent misrepresentation  tortuous interference with prospective economic advantage and declaratory relief 
the action arose out of a license agreement that genomic solutions entered into with affymetrix with respect to certain affymetrix patent rights 
in november  affymetrix filed a counter claim against genomic solutions alleging breach of contract and requesting approximately million in damages for license and other fees and interest allegedly owed 
on april   affymetrix was granted summary disposition and genomic solutions claims were dismissed 
in june the company settled this claim and paid million to affymetrix 
in december   oxford gene technology ltd 
filed suit against our genomic solutions subsidiary  mergen ltd  clontech laboratories  inc  perkinelmer life sciences  inc  axon instruments  inc 
and biodiscovery  inc in the united states district court for the district of delaware seeking unspecified damages as a result of alleged infringement by each of the defendants of a united states patent issued to oxford gene technology 
on may   the company and oxford gene technology settled the dispute and the lawsuit was dismissed 
under the settlement  genomic solutions will display certain notices in connection with the marketing of certain genomic related products 
in addition  a nominal amount was paid to oxford gene technology 
on february   paul d 
grindle  the former owner of harvard apparatus  inc  initiated an arbitration proceeding against us and certain directors before jams in boston  massachusetts 
mr 
grindle s claims arise out of post closing purchase price adjustments related to our purchase of the assets and business of harvard apparatus by virtue of an asset purchase agreement dated march  and certain related agreements 
in the arbitration demand  mr 
grindle sought the return of  shares of common stock in harvard bioscience  or the disgorgement of the profits of our sale of the stock  as well as compensatory damages and multiple damages and attorney s fees under mass 
gen 
laws  chapter a 
in a demand letter that was attached to the arbitration demand  mr 
grindle asserted losses in the amount of million  representing the value of the  shares of harvard bioscience s common stock as of january  on october   we received a decision from the arbitrator that we have prevailed on all claims asserted against us and certain of our directors in the arbitration action 
specifically  we received a written decision from the arbitrator granting our motion for summary disposition with respect to all claims brought against all parties in the action 
we filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court seeking to confirm the arbitrator s decision 
mr 
grindle filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court seeking to vacate the arbitrator s decision 
these two matters were consolidated 
on or about july   the massachusetts superior court granted our motion to confirm the arbitrator s decision and to deny mr 
grindle s motion to vacate 
mr 
grindle has filed a notice of appeal with the massachusetts appeals court and an application for a direct appellate review with the massachusetts supreme judicial court  both of which are pending 
on may   we served a claim notice the claim notice on the former shareholders of union biometrica the former shareholders  seeking indemnification in connection with the may  merger agreement that effectuated our acquisition of union biometrica 
the claim notice had the effect of withholding the release of certain shares of our common stock placed in escrow as part of the merger consideration to the former shareholders 
on september   the former shareholders served a demand for arbitration on us which essentially set forth defenses against the indemnification claims asserted in the claim notice  alleged that we did not have an adequate basis for our claim notice and asserted that the former shareholders could be harmed by a decline in value of the escrowed shares as a result of our failure to release the escrowed shares 
a hearing was held by an arbitrator in late april and early may on july   we received the arbitrator s award the award in favor of the former shareholders 
the arbitrator ruled that we must release  shares of our common stock held in escrow to the former shareholders and also must pay the former shareholders approximately  which represents the difference between the market value of  shares of our common stock held in escrow as of may   and the market value of those shares as of the date those shares are released  calculated as prescribed by the escrow agreement 
each party sought certain corrections to the ruling 
on august   the award became final and the former shareholders were awarded approximately  plus interest 
this charge and certain related costs  totaling approximately  is reflected in our financial results for the year ended december  after the award became final  we entered into a settlement agreement with the former shareholders pursuant to which we paid approximately  to the former shareholders and the parties exchanged mutual releases  which  among other things  provide that the former shareholders will not seek to confirm or modify the award and we will not seek to vacate or modify the award 
in addition  from time to time  we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
except as disclosed above  we are not currently a party to any such claims or proceedings  which  if decided adversely to us  would either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

overview since  when the current management team began managing harvard bioscience  revenues have grown at an annual compounded growth rate of approximately 
this has been achieved by implementing our three part growth strategy of new product development  strategic partnerships and acquisitions 
this strategy has provided us with strong organic growth in good economic times and in tough economic times  such as we experienced in and  it has provided us with strong acquisition growth 
during  although we continued with new product development and strategic partnerships which did contribute to revenues  our revenue growth was primarily due to acquisitions we made in and our recent acquisition activity history is listed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
with the acquisitions of union biometrica in may  genomic solutions in october  genemachines in march and biorobotics in september  an increasing portion of our revenues is the result of sales of relatively high priced products  considered to be capital equipment 
the capital equipment market is very seasonal compared to our traditional catalog business and as such  we believe we have experienced  and we believe we will continue to experience  substantial fluctuations in our quarterly revenues 
delays in purchase orders  receipt  manufacture or shipment of products or receivables collection of these relatively high priced products could lead to substantial variability in our revenues  operating results and working capital requirements from quarter to quarter 
approximately  of our revenues in was derived from capital equipment products 
also  we may misinterpret trends of our capital equipment product lines due to the cyclical nature of the capital equipment purchasing market 
the cyclical buying pattern of the capital equipment purchasing market could mask or exaggerate the economic trends underlying the market for our capital equipment product lines 
specifically  a decline in any quarter that is typically a quarter that we would expect to contribute less than one quarter of projected revenue for the year  could be misinterpreted if the decline was due instead to a negative trend in the market and or in the demand for our products 
conversely  an increase in any quarter that is typically a quarter which we would expect to contribute less than one quarter of projected revenue for the year  could be misinterpreted as a favorable trend in the market and or in the demand for our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in general  we believe that we have seen  particularly in the last half of  a strengthening in the economy 
however  we do believe that the economy is still uncertain 
while we are optimistic that we can return to solid organic growth in addition to growth from acquisitions  we are unable to definitively label what we saw as strength in the second half of as a trend that is likely to continue  or even as a trend 
we will continue to monitor both the market  as well as our internal resources  as we pursue our goal of maintaining and or improving the operating metrics of the company 
generally  management evaluates the financial performance of its operations before the effects of stock compensation expense and before the effects of purchase accounting related to our acquisitions 
our goal is to develop and sell products that profitably accelerate drug discovery and as such we monitor the operating metrics of the company and when appropriate effect organizational changes to leverage infrastructure and distribution channels 
in the table below  we provide an overview of the operating metrics commonly reviewed by our management 
during we entered into a million credit facility with brown brothers harriman co  under which we have drawn down approximately million as of march  when we funded the acquisition of kdscientific 
we believe that the financial covenants contained in the credit facility involving income  debt coverage and cash flow  as well as minimum working capital requirements are covenants that we will be in compliance with under current operating plans 
the credit facility also contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
additionally  the facility requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash in excess of million and for those which may be funded with equity in excess of million 
w do not believe that these requirements will be a significant constraint in operating the company and continuing with the acquisition portion of our growth strategy 
historically  we have funded acquisitions with debt  capital raised by issuing equity and cash flow from operations 
in order to continue the acquisition portion of our three part growth strategy we will need to raise more capital  either by incurring additional debt  issuing equity or a combination 
currently  we may be unable to access the public equity markets due to an outstanding amendment to a current report on form k in connection with a previous acquisition 
in addition  we may not be eligible to use form s to effect a registration of our equity 
we are in the process of seeking to complete this potentially outstanding filing and anticipate that we will become current with our required filings under form k and will become eligible to register equity in the foreseeable future 
however  until this matter is resolved  our ability to raise capital may be limited to private equity transactions and or additional borrowing and may result in entering into an agreement on less than favorable terms 
operating metrics for the years ended december  in thousands of revenue of revenue of revenue total revenues cost of product revenues sales and marketing expense research and development expense general administrative expense revenues 
we generate revenues by selling instruments  devices and consumables through our catalog  our direct sales force  our distributors and our website 
for products primarily priced under  every one to three years  we intend to distribute a new  comprehensive catalog initially in a series of bulk mailings  first to our existing customers  followed by mailings to targeted markets of potential customers 
over the life of the catalog  distribution will also be made periodically to potential and existing customers through direct mail and trade shows and in response to e mail and telephone inquiries 
from time to time  we also intend to distribute catalog supplements that promote selected areas of our catalog or new products to targeted subsets of our customer base 
future distributions of our comprehensive catalog and our catalog supplements will be determined primarily by the incidence of new product introductions  which cannot be predicted 
our end user customers are research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories 
revenue from catalog sales in any period is a function of time elapsed since the last mailing of the catalog  the number of catalogs mailed and the number of new items included in the catalog 
we launched our latest comprehensive catalog in march  with approximately  pages and approximately  copies printed 
revenues direct to end users  derived through our catalog and the electronic version of our catalog on our website  represented approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  we do not currently have the capability to accept purchase orders through our website 
products typically in the   price range are primarily sold under brand names of distributors including amersham biosciences 
they are mainly scientific instruments like spectrophotometers and plate readers that analyze light to detect and quantify a very wide range of molecular and cellular processes or apparatus like gel electrophoresis units 
we also use distributors for both our catalog products and our higher priced products  for sales in locations where we do not have subsidiaries or where we have distributors in place for acquired businesses 
for the year ended december  approximately of our revenues were derived from sales to distributors 
for our higher priced products  generally those priced over  we have direct sales organizations which consist of sales and marketing personnel  customer support  technical support and field application service support 
these organizations have been structured to attend to the specific needs associated with the promotion and support of higher priced capital equipment customers 
the combined expertise of both our sales and technical support staff provide a balanced skill set when promoting the relevant products at seminars  on site demonstrations and exhibitions which are done routinely 
the expertise of our field service personnel provides complete post sale customer support for both instrument specific service  repair and maintenance  and applications support 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from sales by our direct sales force 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from products we manufacture or from collaboration and research grant projects 
the remaining of our revenues were derived from complementary products we distribute in order to provide the researcher with a single source for all equipment needed to conduct a particular experiment 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from sales made by our non us operations 
a large portion of our international sales during this period consisted of sales to amersham biosciences  the distributor for our spectrophotometers  plate readers and d gel electrophoresis products 
amersham biosciences distributes these products to customers around the world  including to many customers in the united states  from its distribution center in upsalla  sweden 
as a result  we believe our international sales would have been a lower percentage of our revenues for the year ended december  if we had shipped our products directly to our end users 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  obsolescence charges  packaging costs  warranty costs  shipping costs and royalties 
our costs of product revenues may vary over time based on the mix of products sold 
we sell products that we manufacture and products that we purchase from third parties 
the products that we purchase from third parties have higher cost of goods sold because the profit is effectively shared with the original manufacturer 
we anticipate that our manufactured products will continue to have a lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues as compared with the cost of non manufactured products for the foreseeable future 
additionally our cost of product revenues as a percent of product revenues will vary based on mix of direct end user sales and distributor sales 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology and human relations functions 
other costs include facility costs  professional fees for legal and accounting services  investor relations  insurances and provision for doubtful accounts 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in sales  marketing and customer support functions 
we also incur costs for travel  trade shows  demonstration equipment  public relations and marketing materials  consisting primarily of the printing and distribution of our approximately  page catalog  supplements and various other specialty catalogs  and the maintenance of our websites 
we may from time to time expand our marketing efforts by employing additional technical marketing specialists in an effort to increase sales of selected categories of products in our catalog 
we may also from time to time expand our direct sales organizations in an effort to increase and or support sales of our higher priced capital equipment instruments or to concentrate on key accounts or promote certain product lines 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel and capital resources used to develop and enhance our products and to support collaboration agreements 
other research and development expense includes fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  and material costs for prototype and test units 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue to make these investments in order to realize the potential of new technologies that we develop  license or acquire 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense resulting from stock option grants to our employees represents the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price of the stock options on the grant date for those options considered fixed awards 
stock compensation is amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
critical accounting policies we believe that our critical accounting policies are as follows valuation of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development in business combinations  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  revenue recognition  and inventory 
valuation of identifiable intangible assets in business combinations 
identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and acquired technology 
such intangible assets arise from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair market values 
amounts assigned to such identifiable intangible assets are primarily based on independent appraisals using established valuation techniques and management estimates 
the value assigned to trademarks was determined by estimating the royalty income that would be negotiated at an arm s length transaction if the asset were licensed from a third party 
a discount factor  ranging from to  which represents both the business and financial risks of such investments  was used to determine the present value of the future streams of income attributable to trademarks 
the specific approach used to value trademarks was the relief from royalty rfr method 
the rfr method assumes that an intangible asset is valuable because the owner of the asset avoids the cost of licensing that asset 
the royalty savings are then calculated by multiplying a royalty rate times a determined royalty base  ie  the applicable level of future revenues 
in determining an appropriate royalty rate  a sample of guideline  arm s length royalty and licensing agreements are analyzed 
in determining the royalty base  forecasts are used based on management s judgments of expected conditions and expected courses of actions 
the value assigned to acquired technology was determined by using a discounted cash flow model which measures what a buyer would be willing to pay currently for the future cash stream potential of existing technology 
the specific method used to value the technologies involved estimating future cash flows to be derived as a direct result of those technologies  and discounting those future streams to their present value 
the discount factors used  ranging from to  reflects the business and financial risks of an investment in technologies 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on managements judgment of expected conditions and expected courses of action 
valuation of in process research and development in business combinations 
purchase price allocation to in process research and development represents the estimated fair value of research and development projects that are reasonably believed to have no alternative future use 
the value assigned to in process research and development was determined by independent appraisals by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially feasible products  estimating the percentage of completion at the acquisition date  estimating the resulting net risk adjusted cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the discount rates used in determining the in process research and development expenditures reflects a higher risk of investment because of the higher level of uncertainty due in part to the nature of the company and the industry to constantly develop new technology for future product releases and ranged from to 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based on assumptions the company believed at the time to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
given the uncertainties of the development process  no assurance can be given that deviations from the company s estimates will occur and no assurance can be given that the in process research and development projects identified will ever reach either technological or commercial success 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles with finite lives and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in who our competitors are and what they do  significant changes in our relationship with amersham biosciences  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we were to determine that the value of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives was not recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the aforementioned factors  then the recoverability of those assets to be held and used would be measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of those assets to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose 
in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but rather tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the company s reporting units with their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the company is required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset shall be its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company performed its annual impairment test on december   which did not indicate any impairment 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to determine our annual income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves determining our current and deferred income tax expense as well as accounting for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the future tax consequences attributable to these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet this more likely than not standard as required in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we must establish a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  we must allocate the related income tax expense to income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of operations to the extent those deferred tax assets originated from continuing operations 
to the extent income tax benefits are allocated to stockholders equity  the related valuation allowance also must be allocated to stockholders equity 
management judgment and estimates are required in determining our income tax provision  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have established a valuation allowance attributable to certain acquisition related temporary differences as we believe that a portion of the deferred tax assets at december  will not meet the more likely than not standard for realization in the carryback and carryforward periods based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
we review the recoverability of deferred tax assets during each reporting period 
revenue recognition 
the company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment of product and or performance of a service  such as installation or training 
revenue is recognized if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  customer acceptance has occurred  collectability is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
the company has no obligations to customers after the date products are shipped or installed  if applicable  other than pursuant to warranty obligations and service or maintenance contracts 
the company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
the company provides for the estimated amount of future returns upon shipment of products or installation  if applicable  based on historical experience 
while product returns and warranty costs have historically not been significant  they have been within our expectations and the provisions established  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates and warranty repair costs that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the cost to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or increased costs materialize 
the company makes estimates evaluating its allowance for doubtful accounts 
on an ongoing basis  the company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been significant  they have been within our expectations and the provisions established  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventory 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase first in  first out method and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost  based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand 
since forecasted product demand quite often is a function of previous and current demand  a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  the company s industry is subject to technological change and new product development  and technological advances could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant adverse impact on the value of the company s inventory and its reported operating results 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to the effects of our acquisitions and the full year effect of acquisitions made in  compared to a partial year impact in revenues for would have been approximately million if our sales denominated in foreign currencies were translated into us dollars using exchange rates  an increase of over the favorable foreign exchange effects for the year is due primarily to the strengthening of the british pound sterling and the euro against the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues increased million or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product revenues  cost of product revenues for and was 
for  approximately  of the cost of product sales was related to fair value adjustments of inventory and backlog acquired from genomic solutions  btx  genemachines  biorobotics and hoefer for products which were shipped in for  approximately  of the cost of product sales was related to fair value adjustments of inventory and backlog acquired from genomic solutions for products which were shipped in for and  excluding fair value adjustments related to acquisitions of  and  respectively  in cost of product sales  gross margin as a percent of total revenues was 
approximately  of estimated fair value adjustments related to the acquisitions of biorobotics and hoefer remain on the balance sheet as of december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in from million in due primarily to acquisitions 
a portion of the increase is due to the effects of our acquisitions and our acquisitions having a full year impact on spending compared to a partial year impact in the balance of the increase in spending over was due primarily to increased costs for insurance partially offset by a decrease in bonus earned under the bonus plan compared to the bonus plan and legal expense related to arbitration proceedings 
restructuring and severance related expenses 
for the year ended december   we incurred a total charge of  for restructuring at both our union biometrica and bio chrom subsidiaries 
the restructuring at our union biometrica subsidiary consolidated most general and administrative activity into our holliston facility and refocused research and development efforts 
the restructuring charges at biochrom was related to the movement of the operation of walden precision apparatus into the biochrom facility 
this consolidation of operations  which was planned at the time of the acquisition of walden precision apparatus in july  eliminated duplicative positions in both our biochrom and walden precision apparatus operations  and reduced facility costs 
of the  charge for restructuring  approximately  was for severance and related costs  with the balance of  consisting of excess unused lease space 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  to million in from million in due primarily to acquisitions made during and as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expense was in compared to in this increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to the higher costs associated with the direct sales force at our genomic solutions subsidiary  which we acquired in october  compared to the traditional spending rate for sales through a catalog or through distributors that we have historically experienced 
research and development expense 
research and development spending  which includes expenses related to research revenues  was million in compared to million for the same period in this net increase is primarily due to acquisitions made during and partially offset by a reduction in expenses as a result of the restructuring at union biometrica in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of revenues  research and development was for both and in process research and development expense 
as of the date of the acquisition of genomic solutions in  we recorded million of in process research and development expense representing the estimated fair value of acquired research and development projects with no alternative future use 
stock compensation expense 
in we recorded  compared to million for of stock compensation expense 
this expense is related to options granted prior to our initial public offering and to options issued in exchange for the outstanding options of union biometrica in connection with the acquisition of union biometrica 
stock compensation expense has decreased as the company uses the graded method  which results in decreasing compensation expense from the date of the stock option grant until the vesting dates 
we will recognize  of stock compensation expense over the remaining vesting life of the options 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of intangibles  including amortization of acquired technologies  was million in compared to million in this increase is directly attributed to acquisitions made in and other income expense  net 
other expense  net for of  included approximately  in charges related to an arbitration award in favor of the former stockholders of union biometrica 
other expense  net for also included net interest expense of approximately  compared to net interest income of  for this shift from interest income to interest expense is due to cash and interest bearing debt being increasingly used to fund acquisitions since other expense  net for also included a  foreign exchange gain compared to a  gain for the same period last year 
other than debt that is treated as a long term investment  these exchange gains and losses are primarily related to debt between our subsidiaries 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates were for and for notwithstanding the effects of the nondeductible charges related to an arbitration award in  in process research and development charges for and certain stock compensation expense for and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the majority of this increase is due to the impact of acquisitions made in and the full year impact of acquisitions made in the balance of the increase was primarily from the leveraged growth in acquisitions and from existing businesses that introduced new products 
revenues for would have been approximately million if our sales denominated in foreign currencies were translated into us dollars using exchange rates  an increase of over cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product revenues  cost of product revenues for was higher by compared to due to the additional cost of product revenues for fair value adjustments made to inventory and backlog acquired in connection with the acquisition of genomic solutions and sold prior to december  without this additional expense of  the cost of product revenues as a percent of product revenues would have been the same as it was for a significant portion of the expenses associated with collaboration revenue is included in research and development expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in from million in due primarily to acquisitions 
a portion of the increase  million or  is due to the effects of our acquisitions and our acquisitions having a full year impact on spending compared to a partial year impact in the balance of the increase in spending over of approximately  was due primarily to increases in expenses such as insurance  professional legal and audit services  and salaries and related costs 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in restructuring and severance related expenses 
during we incurred a charge of  related to restructurings at our union biometrica ubi and biochrom subsidiaries 
the restructuring at ubi was due to the lack of strong revenue growth to support its infrastructure 
the restructuring charges associated with ubi in totaled approximately  and consisted of  in lease buyout costs for excess and unused space  and  in personnel severance and related costs 
as planned when we completed the acquisition of walden precision apparatus wpa in july  the operations of wpa were moved into the biochrom facility in the third quarter of as part of this consolidation  we eliminated duplicative positions in our biochrom and wpa operations and reduced facility costs 
this resulted in a  restructuring charge in  which consisted entirely of severance and related costs related to existing biochrom employees 
during  severance packages totaling  including related costs  were negotiated for the president of ubi and for the chief scientific officer of ubi 
both the president and chief scientific officer were executives of ubi prior to our acquisition of ubi  and the president was the majority shareholder prior to the acquisition 
the termination of their employment resulted in an additional expense of  related to the intangible asset recorded at the date of acquisition for in place work force 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  to million in from million in due primarily to acquisitions 
excluding the effect of acquisitions made during and of million  sales and marketing expense grew  or  due primarily to the addition of sales  customer and technical support personnel to support the direct distribution of certain of our biochrom products 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expense was in compared to in research and development expense 
research and development spending was million in  million of which was related to businesses acquired in and excluding this million  spending in was approximately million  a decrease of approximately  from spending in this decrease was due to several factors including the timing of project spending  the amount of spending related to collaboration revenues  and the restructuring of our union biometrica subsidiary during the year 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development was in compared to in in process research and development expense 
as of the date of the acquisitions in of genomic solutions and in of warner instruments and union biometrica  we recorded million   and million respectively of in process research and development expense representing the estimated fair value of acquired research and development projects with no alternative future use 
stock compensation expense 
we recorded million of stock compensation expense in the twelve months ended december  we will recognize approximately  of additional expense over the remaining vesting life of the options 
in  we recorded stock compensation expense of approximately million in connection with the grant of stock options to employees 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  including amortization of acquired technology  was million in and million in as a result of fully adopting sfas no 
 we did not record any amortization of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles in for acquisitions subsequent to june   no amortization expense for goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles was recorded during if this adoption had been made at the beginning of  amortization expense would have been approximately  for compared to the million recorded in this increase of approximately  was the result of amortizing definite lived intangible assets related to our acquisitions in and the full year effect of amortization of definite lived intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
other income expense  net 
other income  net  was  in compared to million in net interest income for was  compared to million in net interest income for and was the result of interest earned on the proceeds from our december initial public offering and the underwriters exercise of the over allotment in january the decline in net interest income in compared to was due to lower interest rates in  and lower available cash balances in this reduction in cash balances was the result of using cash  both in and  primarily to fund acquisitions 
other income for also includes a favorable foreign currency gain of  compared to an unfavorable currency loss of  in effective january   certain debt between us and our foreign subsidiaries is now treated as a long term investment rather than as debt with repayment expected in the foreseeable future as it was previously treated 
accordingly  in we did not record a foreign currency gain adjustment in our consolidated statement of operations related to this intercompany debt 
instead  we recorded the effect of the exchange rate fluctuation as a currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity deficit 
the currency translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income in connection with this intercompany debt in was a gain of  in  the foreign currency gain reflected in the income statement related to this intercompany debt was approximately  income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates were for and for notwithstanding the effects of the nondeductible in process research and development charges for and  certain stock compensation expense for and and certain amortization of goodwill and intangibles for the decrease in the income tax rate was principally due to the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have an indefinite life 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our business through cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of common stock  and preferred stock  and bank borrowings 
our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from investing activities  including funding of acquisitions and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million which represents a decrease of approximately million from december  approximately million in cash was used to partially fund the acquisitions of btx in january and genemachines in march an additional million in proceeds from a demand bridge note entered into in march was used to fund the remaining purchase price for the acquisition of genemachines 
during the second quarter of  million in cash was used in settlement of a dispute between our subsidiary genomic solutions and affymetrix 
this amount was fully reserved for by genomic solutions on the balance sheet prior to our acquisition of genomic solutions 
during the third quarter of  we received cash in the amount of approximately million as payment in full  including accrued interest  of promissory notes issued in september to our ceo  chane graziano 
these proceeds and additional cash on hand were used to partially fund the acquisition of biorobotics in september in october  we entered into a second demand bridge note for million to partially fund the acquisition of biorobotics 
on november   we entered into a million revolving credit facility with brown brothers harriman the bank 
the credit facility bears an interest rate equal to the bank s base rate which at december  was equal to the prime rate of and has a three year term 
the credit facility also provides for certain restrictive covenants and financial tests  and the breach of such covenants may require repayment of the outstanding debt before the end of the three year term 
we are currently in compliance with such covenants 
as of december   we have borrowed million against the credit facility  in part used to repay the million outstanding on bridge notes entered into with brown brothers harriman in and million to fund the acquisition of hoefer in november in connection with our march acquisition of kdscientific  we borrowed an additional million under the credit facility and currently have approximately million outstanding thereunder 
our operating activities generated cash of million in   in and million in for all periods presented  operating cash flows were primarily due to operating results  including the full year effect of acquisitions prior to non cash charges  partially offset by working capital requirements 
during  the million of cash provided by operating activities was net of a million settlement paid to affymetrix and a million settlement paid to the former shareholders of union biometrica 
our operating cash flow for was also negatively impacted by approximately million from the build up in accounts receivables of several of the acquisitions we made during the year 
during  genomic solutions required approximately million in cash to fund working capital needs primarily as a result of the liabilities that were assumed as part of the acquisition 
our investing activities used cash of million in  million in  and million in primarily for funding acquisitions which are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our financing activities have historically consisted of borrowings under a revolving credit facility  long term debt and the issuance of preferred stock and common stock  including the common stock issued in our initial public offering 
financing activities provided cash of million in  used cash of million in and provided cash of million in during  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with brown brothers harriman co 
as of december   we have borrowed million against the credit facility  in part used to repay the million outstanding on bridge notes entered into with brown brothers harriman in and million to fund the acquisition of hoefer in november in addition  we received million from the repayment of a note receivable from an officer 
during  we used approximately million of cash to repay debt  which originated at the sellers request for the acquisition of scieplas ltd 
this was partially offset by proceeds from common stock issuances of approximately million of which  was from the repayment of a note receivable from an officer 
overview of cash flows for the years ended december  in thousands cash flows from operations net income adjust non cash items changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operations investing activities acquisition of businesses other investing activities cash used by investing activities financing activities cash provided by repayments of debt other financing activities cash provided used by financing activities exchange effect on cash decrease in cash our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
based on our current operations and current operating plans  we expect that our available cash  cash generated from current operations and debt capacity will be sufficient to finance current operations and capital expenditures  for at least months 
however  we may use substantial amounts of capital to accelerate product development or expand our sales and marketing activities 
we may need to raise additional capital in order to make significant acquisitions 
additional capital raising activities will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we raise capital by issuing equity securities 
currently  we may be unable to access the public equity markets due to outstanding amendment to a current report on form k in connection with a previous acquisition 
in addition  we may not be able to use form s to effect a registration of our equity 
we are in the process of seeking to complete this filing and anticipate that we will become current with our required filings under form k in the foreseeable future 
however  until this matter is resolved  our ability to raise capital may be limited to private equity transactions and or additional borrowings and may result in entering into an agreement on less than favorable terms 
in addition  our credit facility with brown brothers harriman contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash in excess of million and for those which may be funded with equity in excess of million 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital on favorable terms or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following schedule represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligation total and beyond notes payable capital leases  including imputed interest operating leases total impact of foreign currencies we sell our products in many countries and a substantial portion of our sales  costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  especially the united kingdom pound sterling and the euro 
during and the us dollar weakened against these currencies resulting in increased consolidated revenue and earnings growth 
the gain associated with the translation of foreign equity into us dollars was approximately million for and  for  approximately million 
in addition  the currency fluctuations resulted in approximately  and  in foreign currency gains in and  respectively 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency position 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
however  as our sales expand internationally  we plan to evaluate our currency risks and we may enter into foreign exchange contracts from time to time to mitigate foreign currency exposure 
backlog our order backlog was approximately million as of december  and million as of december  we include in backlog only those orders for which we have received valid purchase orders 
most purchase orders may be cancelled at any time prior to shipment 
our backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
we typically ship our backlog at any given time within days

therefore  the company will be required to adopt the disclosure requirements of the statement as of december  impact of inflation we believe that our revenues and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the past three years 
important factors that may affect future operating results our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on a number of factors  including if we engage in any acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs  and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business strategy includes the future acquisition of businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
if we undertake any acquisition  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all 
future acquisitions could reduce stockholders ownership  cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives 
current uncertain economic trends may adversely impact our business 
we have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for our products as a result of the recent downturn and increased uncertainty in the general economic environment in which we and our customers operate 
we cannot project the extent of the impact of the recent economic downturn 
if economic conditions worsen or if a wider economic slowdown occurs  we may experience a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the timing of capital equipment purchases by customers and the seasonal nature of purchasing in europe 
our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the seasonal timing of capital equipment purchases by customers and the seasonal nature of purchasing in europe 
our revenues may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the seasonal nature of the capital equipment market  the timing of catalog mailings and new product introductions  future acquisitions and our substantial sales to european customers  who in summer months often defer purchases 
with the acquisitions of union biometrica in may  genomic solutions in october  genemachines in march and biorobotics in september  an increasing portion of our revenues are the result of sales of relatively high priced products  considered to be capital equipment 
the capital equipment market is very seasonal and as such  we will experience substantial fluctuations in our quarterly revenues 
additionally  delays in purchase orders  receipt  manufacture  shipment or receivables collection of these relatively high priced products could lead to substantial variability in revenues  operating results and working capital requirements from quarter to quarter  which could adversely affect our stock price 
in particular  delays or reduction in purchase orders from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may misinterpret trends of our capital equipment product lines due to the cyclical nature of the capital equipment purchasing market 
the cyclical buying pattern of the capital equipment purchasing market could mask or exaggerate the economic trends underlying the market for our capital equipment product lines 
specifically  a decline in any quarter that is typically a quarter that we would expect to contribute less than one quarter projected revenue for the year  could be misinterpreted if the decline was due instead to a negative trend in the market or in the demand for our products 
conversely  an increase in any quarter that is typically a quarter that we would expect to contribute less than one quarter of projected revenue for the year  could be misinterpreted as a favorable trend in the market and in the demand for our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may not realize the expected benefits of our recent acquisitions of btx  genemachines  biorobotics  hoefer and kdscientific due to difficulties integrating the businesses  operations and product lines 
our ability to achieve the benefits of our recent acquisitions of btx  genemachines  biorobotics  hoefer and kdscientific will depend in part on the integration and leveraging of technology  operations  sales and marketing channels and personnel 
the integration process is a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
the challenges involved in this integration include the following demonstrating to customers and suppliers that the acquisitions will not result in adverse changes in client service standards or business focus and addressing any perceived adverse changes in business focus 
we may have difficulty successfully integrating the acquired businesses  the domestic and foreign operations or the product lines  and as a result  we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
additionally  we cannot assure that our growth rate will equal the growth rates that have been experienced by us and the acquired companies  respectively  operating as separate companies in the past 
genomic solutions  our recently acquired subsidiary  has a history of losses and may not be able to sustain profitability 
genomic solutions incurred net losses of million for the six months ended june   million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as of june   genomic solutions had an accumulated deficit of million 
in september  genomic solutions instituted a restructuring plan designed to reduce its operating expenses 
in july  genomic solutions announced a further restructuring of its operations 
however  even with these restructurings  genomic solutions needs to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
genomic solutions continued revenue growth depends on many factors  many of which are beyond its control  including factors discussed in this risk factors section 
genomic solutions may not sustain revenue growth 
even if genomic solutions does achieve profitability  it may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as an acquisitive company  we may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquired company s previous stockholders or our current stockholders 
as an acquisitive company  we may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquired company s previous stockholders or our current stockholders 
these lawsuits could result from the actions of the acquisition target prior to the date of the acquisition  from the acquisition transaction itself or from actions after the acquisition 
defending potential lawsuits could cost us significant expense and detract management s attention from the operation of the business 
additionally  these lawsuits could result in the cancellation of or the inability to renew  certain insurance coverage that would be necessary to protect our assets 
our business is subject to economic  political and other risks associated with international revenues and operations 
since we manufacture and sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our revenues from our non us operations represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues 
in addition  a number of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which resulted in a foreign currency gain of approximately  for the yearended december  and an increase of foreign equity of approximately  for the year ended december   changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  including western europe and japan  in particular  potentiallynegativeconsequences from changes in tax laws affecting the ability to expatriate profits  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  and unfavorable labor regulations applicable to european operations  such as severance and the unenforceability of non competition agreements in the european union 
we may lose money when we exchange foreign currency received from international revenues into us dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our business was conducted in functional currencies other than the us dollar  which is our reporting currency 
as a result  currency fluctuations among the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
in the future  we may undertake to manage foreign currency risk through additional hedging methods 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in managing foreign currency risk or in predicting the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
additional costs for complying with recent changes in securities and exchange commission  nasdaq stock market and accounting rules could adversely affect our profits 
recent changes in the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq rules  as well as changes in accounting rules  will cause us to incur significant additional costs including professional fees  as well as additional personnel costs  in order to keep informed of the changes and operate in a compliant manner 
these additional costs may be significant enough to cause our growth targets to be reduced  and consequently  our financial position and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
with new rules  including the sarbanes oxley act of  we may have difficulty in retaining or attracting officers  directors for the board and various sub committees thereof 
the recent changes in sec and nasdaq rules  including those resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of  may result in us being unable to attract and retain the necessary officers  board directors and members of sub committees thereof  to effectively manage 
the perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes  may deter qualified individuals from wanting to participate in these roles 
we may have difficulty obtaining adequate directors and officers insurance and the cost for coverage may significantly increase 
as an acquisitive company  we may have difficulty in obtaining adequate directors and officers insurance to protect us and our directors and officers from claims made against them 
additionally  even if adequate coverage is available  the costs for such coverage may be significantly greater than current costs 
this additional cost may have a significant effect on our profits and as a result our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we plan significant growth  and there is a risk that we will not be able to manage this growth 
our success will depend on the expansion of our operations both through organic growth and acquisitions 
effective growth management will place increased demands on management  operational and financial resources and expertise 
to manage growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our operational  financial and management systems  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
failure to manage this growth effectively could impair our ability to generate revenue or could cause our expenses to increase more rapidly than revenue  resulting in operating losses or reduced profitability 
if we fail to retain key personnel and hire  train and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced revenue or increased costs 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of key management  technical and scientific personnel 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time upon short notice 
the loss of the services of any member of the senior management team  including the chief executive officer  chane graziano  the president  david green  the chief financial officer  susan luscinski  or any of the managerial  technical or scientific staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives 
we maintain key person life insurance on messrs 
graziano and green 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the technology area is intense  and we operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive  including boston  massachusetts and london and cambridge  england  and where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high 
as a result  competition for qualified personnel is intense  particularly in the areas of general management  finance  information technology  engineering and science  and the process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy and expensive  and may become more expensive in the future 
if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop products and technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products 
we expect to encounter increased competition from both established and development stage companies that continually enter the market 
we anticipate that these competitors will include companies developing and marketing life sciences research tools  health care companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers  diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  analytical instrument companies and companies developing drug discovery technologies 
currently  our principal competition comes from established companies that provide products that perform many of the same functions for which we market our products 
our competitors may develop or market products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  operational  marketing and technical resources than we do 
moreover  these competitors may offer broader product lines and tactical discounts  and may have greater name recognition 
in addition  we may face competition from new entrants into the field 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our products compete in markets that are subject to rapid technological change  and therefore one or more of our products could be made obsolete by new technologies 
because the market for drug discovery tools is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions  our product lines may be made obsolete unless we are able to continually improve existing products and develop new products 
to meet the evolving needs of its customers  we must continually enhance our current and planned products and develop and introduce new products 
however  we may experience difficulties that may delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements 
in addition  our product lines are based on complex technologies that are subject to rapid change as new technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace 
we may have difficulty in keeping abreast of the rapid changes affecting each of the different markets we serve or intend to serve 
our failure to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing technology  market demands or the requirements of our customers could cause our product sales to decline  and we could experience significant losses 
we offer and plan to offer a broad product line and have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for development of new products and enhanced versions of our existing products 
the speed of technological change in our market may prevent us from being able to successfully market some or all of our products for the length of time required to recover development costs 
failure to recover the development costs of one or more products or product lines could decrease our profitability or cause us to experience significant losses 
we entered into a million credit facility in november which contains certain financial and negative covenants the breach of which may adversely affect our financial condition 
we anticipate that our operations will support the covenants required as part of the million revolving credit facility with brown brothers harriman 
however  if we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants  in addition to other actions the creditor may require  the amounts drawn on the million facility may become immediately due and payable 
this immediate payment may negatively impact our financial condition and we may be forced by our creditor into actions which may not be in our best interests 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to implement our acquisition strategy  expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our financial resources which include available cash  cash generated from operations  and debt and equity capacity  will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures for at least twelve months 
however  this expectation is premised on the current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including market acceptance of new products and future opportunities with collaborators 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise capital could seriously harm our business and product development and acquisition efforts 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity linked securities  existing percentages of ownership in our common stock will be reduced 
in addition  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may issue securities that have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products  or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable 
we may be unable to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  our credit facility with brown brothers harriman contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash in excess of million and for those which may be funded with equity in excess of million 
currently  we may be unable to access the public equity markets due to an outstanding amendment to a current report of form k in connection with a previous acquisition 
in addition  we may not be eligible to use form s to effect a registration of our equity 
we are in the process of seeking to complete this potentially outstanding filing 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail operations or change our business strategy 
if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  third parties may use our technology  which would impair our ability to compete in our markets 
our continued success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for certain of our products throughout the world 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
we own us patents and have patent applications pending in the us we also own numerous us registered trademarks and trade names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending 
we rely on patents to protect a significant part of our intellectual property and to enhance our competitive position 
however  our presently pending or future patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patent previously issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued or which may be issued to us in the future may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar to our products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our ability to be commercially competitive will be materially impaired 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners upon the commencement of a relationship 
however  we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances 
in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
in addition  adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information 
the loss or exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive and time consuming 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions 
several of our products are based on patents that are closely surrounded by patents held by competitors or potential competitors 
as a result  we believe there is a greater likelihood of a patent dispute than would be expected if our patents were not closely surrounded by other patents 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
we may not prevail in any of these suits 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
for example  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others  including the patent rights  trademarks and trade names of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is costly and the outcome is uncertain 
if we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or is unable to design around any third party patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products and services  which could result in reduced revenue 
we are dependent upon our licensed technologies and may need to obtain additional licenses in the future to offer our products and remain competitive 
we have licensed key components of our technologies from third parties 
while we do not currently derive a material portion of our revenue from products that depend on these licensed technologies  we may in the future 
if our license agreements were to terminate prematurely or if we breach the terms of any licenses or otherwise fail to maintain our rights to these technologies  we may lose the right to manufacture or sell our products that use these licensed technologies 
in addition  we may need to obtain licenses to additional technologies in the future in order to keep our products competitive 
if we fail to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies  we may not be able to develop new products that we need to remain competitive 
many of our current and potential customers are from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and are subject to risks faced by those industries 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we expect that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will continue to be our major source of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  such as pricing pressures as third party payers continue challenging the pricing of medical products and services  government regulation  ongoing consolidation and uncertainty of technological change  and to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries 
in particular  several proposals are being contemplated by lawmakers in the united states to extend the federal medicare program to include reimbursement for prescription drugs 
many of these proposals involve negotiating decreases in prescription drug prices or imposing price controls on prescription drugs 
if appropriate reimbursement cannot be obtained  it could result in customers purchasing fewer products from us as they reduce their research and development expenditures 
in particular  the biotechnology industry has been faced with declining market capitalization and a difficult capital raising and financing environment 
if biotechnology companies are unable to obtain the financing necessary to purchase our products  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as it relates to the pharmaceutical industry  several companies have significant patents that have expired or are about to expire  which could result in reduced revenues for those companies 
if pharmaceutical companies suffer reduced revenues as a result of these patent expirations  they may be unable to purchase our products  and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are dependent  both directly and indirectly  upon general health care spending patterns  particularly in the research and development budgets of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  as well as upon the financial condition and purchasing patterns of various governments and government agencies 
many of our customers  including universities  government research laboratories  private foundations and other institutions  obtain funding for the purchase of products from grants by governments or government agencies 
there exists the risk of a potential decrease in the level of governmental spending allocated to scientific and medical research which could substantially reduce or even eliminate these grants 
if government funding necessary to purchase our products were to decrease  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to achieve and sustain market acceptance of our target validation  high throughput screening  assay development and admet screening products across their broad intended range of applications  we will not generate expected revenue growth and could adversely affect profits 
our business strategy depends  in part  on successfully developing and commercializing our admet screening  molecular biology  high throughput high content screening  and genomics  proteomics and high throughput screening to meet customers expanding needs and demands  an example of which is the copas technology obtained from the acquisition of union biometrica 
market acceptance of this and other new products will depend on many factors  including the extent of our marketing efforts and our ability to demonstrate to existing and potential customers that our technologies are superior to other technologies or techniques and products that are available now or may become available in the future 
if our new products do not gain market acceptance  or if market acceptance occurs at a slower rate than anticipated  it could materially adversely affect our business and future growth prospects and could result in a goodwill and or intangible impairment loss 
if amersham biosciences terminates its distribution agreements with us or fails to perform its obligations under the distribution agreements  it could impair the marketing and distribution efforts for some of our products and result in lost revenues 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were generated through two distribution agreements with amersham biosciences 
the first distribution agreement was renegotiated in august under this agreement  amersham biosciences acts as the primary marketing and distribution channel for the products of our biochrom subsidiary and  as a result  we are restricted from allowing another person or entity to distribute  market and sell the majority of the products of our biochrom subsidiary 
we are also restricted from making or promoting sales of the majority of the products of our biochrom subsidiary to any person or entity other than amersham biosciences or its authorized sub distributors 
we have little or no control over amersham biosciences marketing and sales activities or the use of its resources 
amersham biosciences may fail to purchase sufficient quantities of products from us or perform appropriate marketing and sales activities 
the failure by amersham biosciences to perform these activities could materially adversely affect our business and growth prospects during the term of this agreement 
in addition  our inability to maintain our arrangement with amersham biosciences for product distribution could materially impede the growth of our business and our ability to generate sufficient revenue 
our agreement with amersham biosciences may be terminated with days notice under certain circumstances 
this agreement has an initial term of three years  commencing august   after which it will automatically renew for an additional two years  unless terminated earlier by either party 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms by either party upon months prior written notice 
the second distribution agreement  between hoefer  inc  our subsidiary  and amersham biosciences was entered into in november in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of amersham biosciences  including the hoefer name 
the agreement provides that hoefer will be the exclusive supplier of d gel electrophoresis products to amersham biosciences 
hoefer also has the right to develop  manufacture and market d gel electrophoresis products  which would be offered to amersham biosciences for sale under the amersham biosciences brand name 
hoefer has the right to sell any of its products  under the hoefer brand name or any other non amersham biosciences brand name  through other distribution channels  both direct and indirect 
the initial term of the agreement is five years with an automatic five year renewal period 
amersham biosciences may terminate the agreement during the renewal period if they decide to cease all activities in d gel electrophoresis or if hoefer fails to deliver new d gel electrophoresis products 
general electric recently announced its intention to acquire amersham plc  the parent of amersham biosciences 
while general electric has indicated its intention to continue amersham s presence in the life science market  and we believe our relationship with amersham biosciences is good  we cannot guarantee that the distribution agreements will be renewed  that amersham biosciences will aggressively market our products in the future or that general electric will continue the partnership 
accounting for goodwill may have a material adverse effect on us 
we have historically amortized goodwill purchased in our acquisitions on a straight line basis ranging from five to years 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions after june  and existing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions prior to july  that remain as of december  are no longer amortized  but instead are evaluated annually to determine whether any portion of the remaining balance of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable  or more frequently  if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment 
if it is determined in the future that a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is impaired  we will be required to write off that portion of the asset which could have an adverse effect on net income for the period in which the write off occurs 
at december   we had goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of million  or of our total assets 
if our accounting estimates are not correct  our financial results could be adversely affected 
management judgment and estimates are necessarily required in the application of our critical accounting policies 
we discuss these estimates in the subsection entitled critical accounting policies beginning on page if our estimates are incorrect  our future financial operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by litigation or arbitration involving paul d 
grindle 
on february   paul d 
grindle  the former owner of harvard apparatus  inc  initiated an arbitration proceeding against us and certain directors before jams in boston  massachusetts 
mr 
grindle s claims arise out of post closing purchase price adjustments related to our purchase of the assets and business of harvard apparatus by virtue of an asset purchase agreement dated march  and certain related agreements 
in the arbitration demand  mr 
grindle sought the return of  shares of our common stock  or the disgorgement of the profits of our sale of the stock  as well as compensatory damages and multiple damages and attorney s fees under mass 
gen 
laws  chapter a 
in a demand letter that was attached to the arbitration demand  mr 
grindle asserted losses in the amount of million  representing the value of the  shares of our common stock as of january  on october   we received a decision from the arbitrator that we had prevailed on all claims asserted against us and certain of our directors in the arbitration action 
specifically  we received a written decision from the arbitrator granting our motion for summary disposition with respect to all claims brought against all parties in the action 
we filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court seeking to confirm the arbitrator s decision 
mr 
grindle filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court seeking to vacate the arbitrator s decision 
these two matters were consolidated 
on or about july   the massachusetts superior court granted our motion to confirm the arbitrator s decision and to deny mr 
grindle s motion to vacate 
mr 
grindle has filed a notice of appeal with the massachusetts appeals court and an application for a direct appellate review with the massachusetts supreme judicial court  both of which are pending 
customer  vendor and employee uncertainty about the effects of the acquisitions of genomic solutions  btx  genemachines  biorobotics  hoefer and kdscientific could harm us 
we and the acquired companies customers may  in response to the consummation of the acquisitions  delay or defer purchasing decisions 
any delay or deferral in purchasing decisions by customers could adversely affect our business 
similarly  employees of acquired companies may experience uncertainty about their future role until or after we execute our strategies with regard to employees of acquired companies 
this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel following an acquisition 
a significant portion of the sales cycle for ours products is lengthy and we may spend significant time on sales opportunities with no assurance of success 
our ability to obtain customers for our products  specifically for products made by union biometrica and genomic solutions  depends in significant part upon the perception that our products can help accelerate drug discovery and development efforts 
the sales cycle for these systems is typically between three and six months due to the education effort that is required 
our sales efforts often require sales presentations to various departments within a single customer  including research and development personnel and key management 
in addition  we may be required to negotiate agreements containing terms unique to each customer 
we may expend substantial funds and management effort with no assurance that we will successfully sell our systems or products to the customer 
ethical concerns surrounding the use of our products and misunderstanding of the nature of our business could adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our existing products and new products 
genetic screening of humans is used to determine individual predisposition to medical conditions 
genetic screening has raised ethical issues regarding the confidentiality and appropriate uses of the resulting information 
government authorities may regulate or prohibit the use of genetic screening to determine genetic predispositions to medical conditions 
additionally  the public may disfavor and reject the use of genetic screening 
genomic and proteomic research is used to determine the role of genes and proteins in living organisms 
our products are designed and used for genomic and proteomic research and drug discovery and cannot be used for genetic screening without significant modification 
however  it is possible that government authorities and the public may fail to distinguish between the genetic screening of humans and genomic and proteomic research 
if this occurs  our products and the processes for which our products are used may be subjected to government regulations intended to affect genetic screening 
further  if the public fails to distinguish between the two fields  it may pressure our customers to discontinue the research and development initiatives for which our products are used 
additionally  some of our products may be used in areas of research involving cloning  stem cell use  organ transplants and other techniques presently being explored in the drug discovery industry 
these techniques have drawn much negative attention recently in the public forum and could face similar risks to those identified above surrounding products for genomic and proteomic research 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and could experience substantial declines in the future and  as a result  management s attention may be diverted from more productive tasks 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations since its initial public offering in december and may become volatile and could decline in the future  perhaps substantially  in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  revenues and operating results fluctuating or failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  termination or suspension of equity research coverage by securities analysts  comments of securities analysts and mistakes by or misinterpretation of comments from analysts  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or management guidance  investment banks and securities analysts may themselves be subject to suits that may adversely affect the perception of the market  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  announcements of significant acquisitions or financings or changes in strategic partnerships  and a decrease in the demand for our common stock 
in addition  the stock market and the nasdaq national market in general  and the biotechnology industry and small cap markets in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that at times may have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and bylaws may make a takeover more difficult which could cause our stock price to decline 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in the delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt which is opposed by management and the board of directors 
public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
we also have a staggered board of directors that makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to change our management and board of directors 
such provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future 
an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained 
although our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  an active trading market for the shares may not be sustained 
future issuance of preferred stock may dilute the rights of our common stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  privileges and other terms of these shares 
the board of directors may exercise this authority without any further approval of stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of future holders of preferred stock 
cash dividends will not be paid on our common stock 
we intend to retain all of our earnings to finance the expansion and development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be a stockholder s sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 
the merger with genomic solutions may fail to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes  resulting in the recognition of taxable gain or loss in respect of our treatment of the merger as a taxable sale 
both us and genomic solutions intended the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
although the internal revenue service  or irs  will not provide a ruling on the matter  genomic solutions obtained a legal opinion from its tax counsel that the merger constitutes a reorganization for federal income tax purposes 
this opinion does not bind the irs or prevent the irs from adopting a contrary position 
if the merger fails to qualify as a reorganization  the merger would be treated as a deemed taxable sale of assets by genomic solutions for an amount equal to the merger consideration received by genomic solutions stockholders plus any liabilities assumed by us 
as successor to genomic solutions  we would be liable for any tax incurred by genomic solutions as a result of this deemed asset sale 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manufacture and test the majority of products in research centers in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  belgium and austria 
we sell our products globally through our direct catalog sales  direct sales force and indirect distributor channels 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we collect amounts representing a substantial portion of our revenues and pay amounts representing a substantial portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency position 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
however  as our sales expand internationally  we plan to evaluate currency risks and we may enter into foreign exchange contracts from time to time to mitigate foreign currency exposure
