the costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs  which are recognized in the periods incurred 
see note n 
the long term impact of the welding fume loss contingency in the aggregate on operating cash flows and capital markets access is difficult to assess  particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co defendants and insurance carriers 
moreover  the company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims and indemnity payments have been immaterial 
if cost sharing dissipates for some currently unforeseen reason  or the company s trial experience changes overall  it is possible on a longer term basis that the cost of resolving this loss contingency could reduce the company s operating cash flows and restrict capital market access

tars payable in cash require the recording of a liability and related compensation expense to be measured by the difference between the quoted market price of the number of common shares covered by the grant and the option price per common share at grant 
any increases or decreases in the market price of the common share between grant date and exercise date would result in changes to the company s compensation expense 
tars will require a charge against income or a reduction of expense periodically representing any increases or decreases in the value of the anticipated benefits 
this compensation expense is accrued over the vesting period 
for tars payable in common shares  the tar would be accounted for as a stock option and the fair value method of accounting under sfas no

for the years through  the company experienced a material decline in the fair market value of assets in the us company s non contributory defined benefit pension plan trust

in addition  the declining us interest rate environment has significantly increased the present value of pension benefit obligations

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used 
if warranted  these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated 
historically  the company s estimates have been determined to be reasonable and accurate 
no material adjustments to the company s accounting policies have been made in or the company believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
legal and tax contingencies the company  like other manufacturers  is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
such claims and litigation include  without limitation  product liability claims and health  safety and environmental claims  some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos and manganese induced illnesses 
the costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs  which are recognized in the periods incurred 
insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and  where reimbursements are probable  they are recognized in the applicable period 
with respect to costs other than defense costs ie  for liability and or settlement or other resolution  reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost  after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience 
if an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable  or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure is provided in lieu of reserves 
many of the current cases are in preliminary procedural stages and insufficient information exists upon which judgments can be made as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions 
therefore  a range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 
reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change 
moreover  reserves only cover identified and or asserted claims 
future claims could  therefore  give rise to increases to such reserves 
see note n to the consolidated financial statements and the legal proceedings section of this annual report on form k for further discussion of legal contingencies 
the company often faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various 
table of contents filing positions  the company records reserves for probable exposures 
based on management s evaluation of those tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of non us subsidiaries  as such funds are deemed permanently reinvested 
as of december   the company has approximately million of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carryforwards which will reduce taxable income in future years 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
at december   a valuation allowance of million has been recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the company s assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plan in the united states 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets and the market related value of plan assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the market related value of plan assets could be determined by either fair value or a calculated value recognizing changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years 
the method chosen must be applied consistently year to year 
the company used fair values at december for the market related value of plan assets 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense 
the company used between and as the expected long term rate of return on assets during the period through from through  the plan assets had earned a rate of return substantially less than these assumed rates 
the company lowered the expected rate of return on plan assets to approximately for as a result of lower investment returns and interest rates  pension expense increased million in compared to the prior year 
during  investment gains in the company s us pension plans were approximately 
in addition  the company made million of voluntary contributions during  an increase of million over although interest rates have declined in  the substantial increase in invested assets will reduce pension expense 
the company estimates pension expense in will decrease by approximately 
table of contents million 
the company expects to make voluntary contributions of million to the us pension plans during at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used for plan liabilities 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
inventories and reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for domestic inventories  cost is determined principally by the last in  first out lifo method  and for non us inventories  cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the valuation of lifo inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time 
the excess of current cost over lifo cost amounted to million at december  the company reviews the net realizable value of inventory in detail on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management  and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  write downs of inventory values and adjustments to cost of sales may be required 
historically  the company s reserves have approximated actual experience 
accounts receivable and allowances the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered 
the company estimates this allowance based on knowledge of the financial condition of customers  review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future  additional allowances may be required 
historically  the company s reserves have approximated actual experience 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the company s businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including those portions of this management s discussion and analysis that refer to the future may contain forward looking statements that are not historical facts 
those statements are forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of all such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
such 
table of contents forward looking statements  and the company s future performance  operating results  financial position and liquidity  are subject to a variety of factors that could materially affect future results  including competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive global environment and is subject to a variety of competitive factors such as pricing  the actions and strength of its competitors  and the company s ability to maintain its position as a recognized leader in welding technology 
the intensity of foreign competition is substantially affected by fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
the company s competitive position could also be adversely affected should new or emerging entrants become more active in the arc welding business 
economic and market conditions 
the company is subject to general economic  business and industry conditions which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s revenues and profits depend significantly on the overall demand for arc welding and cutting products 
capital spending in the manufacturing and other industrial sectors can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
if economic and market conditions deteriorate  the company s results of operations could to be adversely affected 
international markets 
the company s long term strategy is to increase its share in growing international markets  particularly asia  latin america  eastern europe and other developing markets 
however  there can be no certainty that the company will be successful in its expansion efforts 
the company is subject to the currency risks of doing business abroad  and the possible effects of international terrorism and hostilities 
moreover  international expansion poses challenging demands within the company s infrastructure 
cyclicality and maturity of the welding and cutting industry 
the united states arc welding and cutting industry is both mature and cyclical 
the growth of the domestic arc welding and cutting industry has been and continues to be constrained by numerous factors  including increased cost of steel and the substitution of plastics and other materials in place of fabricated metal parts in many products and structures 
increased offshore production of fabricated steel structures has also decreased the domestic demand for arc welding and cutting products in the company s largest market 
litigation 
the company  like other manufacturers  is subject in the us market to a variety of product liability lawsuits and potential lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while past experience has generally shown these cases to be immaterial  product liability cases in the us against the company  particularly with respect to welding fumes  continue to increase and past experience may not be predictive of the future 
operating factors 
the company is highly dependent on its skilled workforce and efficient production facilities  which could be adversely affected by its labor relations  business interruptions and short term or long term interruptions in the availability of supplies or raw materials or in transportation of finished goods 
research and development 
the company s continued success depends  in part  on its ability to continue to meet customer welding needs through the introduction of new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics 
there can be no assurances that new products or product improvements  once developed  will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to the operating results of the company  or that product development will continue at a pace to sustain future growth

any forward looking statements reflect only the beliefs of the company or its management at the time the statement is made 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates

gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the income statement 
at december   the company had approximately million of foreign exchange contracts which primarily hedged recorded balance sheet exposures or intercompany purchases 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on the company s open foreign exchange contracts at december  would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements to manage the company s exposure to price risk from commodity and energy purchases 
the primary commodities hedged are aluminum  copper and natural gas 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods at predetermined prices or ranges of prices the prices the company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices on the company s open commodity futures at december   would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
the company uses floating rate swaps to convert a portion of its million fixed rate  long term borrowings into short term variable interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on the notes is and the average maturity is eight years 
at december   the company held interest rate swaps of million with a fair value of million 
the company uses the short cut method to account for these swaps as prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the notes after considering the effect of the interest rate swaps was for a hypothetical decrease of in the floating rate would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
at december   the fair value of amounts due to banks approximated carrying value due to its short term maturities 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the company s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december   and was not materially different from the year end carrying value
