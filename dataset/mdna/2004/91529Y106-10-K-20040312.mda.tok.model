item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is the largest provider of group and individual income protection insurance products and a leading provider of life  accident  and long term care products in the united states and the united kingdom 
through its us brokerage operation  which represents approximately percent of total segment operating revenue  the company markets a portfolio of group  individual  and voluntary benefit products and services to employers and their employees  as well as offering a limited number of products to individual customers 
the company believes that its product line  its commitment to high quality service  and its claims management approach position the organization well to compete in this highly competitive business 
in addition to competition  portions of the company s business are sensitive to economic and financial market factors  including consumer confidence  employment levels  and the level of interest rates 
in  there were a number of areas of the business that met expectations  including the company s united kingdom and colonial operations  and its us brokerage group life  voluntary  and individual income protection recently issued business lines 
other areas  primarily the group income protection and individual income protection closed block business lines  faced significant challenges  which the company addressed over the course of the year  as described below 
themes that help in understanding the company s results include the company s experience has been that its us group disability claim trends are correlated with consumer confidence levels and employment growth 
in periods with falling or negative growth in employment  or low consumer confidence  the company has experienced a corresponding increase in disability claim incidence and greater difficulty in returning disabled insureds to work 
according to the us department of labor  the united states economy lost million jobs during the time period between december and december and experienced a change in the unemployment rate from percent in january to percent in december during the same period  the consumer confidence index  as measured by the conference board  fell from to  a percent decrease 
from through  the company experienced an increase in submitted group income protection claims of approximately percent 
during  claim resolution rates  which partially reflect the company s ability to return disabled insureds to work  were lower than in any year since the combined impact of higher claim incidence and lower than usual claim resolutions contributed to the company s reserve strengthening during for its group income protection reserves 
during the second half of  claim resolution rates increased percent from the lower levels experienced during the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of claim incidence rates continue at historically high levels and are an important part of the company s plans  addressed below 
an unfavorable investment environment has a detrimental effect on both the company s revenue and expenses 
from the end of through the end of the yield on the benchmark year us treasury note declined from percent to percent 
this investment environment affected the company in three ways 
first  a large portion of the company s investment portfolio is invested in fixed income securities to pay future policyholder benefits 
falling investment yields increase the amount of reserves which must be established to pay future policyholder liabilities 
unless the company can increase its prices to reflect these lower investment yields  the lower yields place pressure on profit margins 
second  cash flows from existing investments due to interest payments  sales and maturities of securities  or prepayments must be reinvested at lower current rates  which lower the net investment income earned on the investment portfolio 
third  falling investment yields have an impact on employee benefits costs in general  primarily the cost of providing pension benefits to employees 
along with rising medical costs  the investment environment since has put pressure on all employee benefits costs  including the price of products sold by the company 
during  the company addressed the investment environment by strengthening its existing claim reserves for its group income protection business million before tax to reflect the actual change in investment portfolio investment yield rates during and the expectation of lower future investment portfolio yield rates  
table of contents lowering the discount rate for reserves established for new group and individual income protection claims to levels consistent with today s lower levels of interest rates  and  reducing its holdings in below investment grade securities from percent of investments on a carrying value basis at year end to percent at the end of in addition  the improving trend in the investment credit market as well as the reduction in below investment grade securities reduced the company s level of unrealized losses in its fixed maturity bond portfolio from billion at the end of to million at the end of the company also experienced improvement in the amount of unrealized losses on below investment grade securities in an unrealized loss position for over one year 
the company has faced increased media  regulatory  and litigation actions 
beginning in october  the company became the subject of a number of media stories that criticized its processing of disability claims 
this negative media attention created a significant public relations challenge for the company 
as a result of this negative attention  the company has experienced an increase in attention from its regulators  particularly state insurance departments 
in addition  more than purported class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits have been brought against the company and or its subsidiaries directors and officers 
refer to item note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the company s litigation 
the company has responded to this negative publicity by increasing its communication level with all of its constituents  to be sure all these individuals are equipped with the facts 
the company is also being responsive to all inquiries concerning its processes and practices  and while it responds to these various parties the company has continued to review its existing processes and practices and has made refinements and improvement in procedures an approach it has followed for many years 
although this adverse publicity has made it more difficult to compete in the marketplace  the company has not experienced any material change in sales  persistency  or sales force personnel as a result of the negative attention 
the company believes that its strong relationships with its producers and customers  supported by consistent service and claim handling  have been significant factors in maintaining its strong reputation in the market 
claim and investment results combined to weaken the company s balance sheet in late and early  leading the company to raise capital in various ways in mid to late the cumulative effect of statutory investment portfolio losses and claim results reduced the company s risk based capital ratio for its us insurance subsidiaries 
the weighted average risk based capital ratio based on the naic company action level formula moved from percent as of december  to percent as of december  actions to restore balance sheet strength during included selling billion in equity and equity related securities  with a portion of the proceeds used to reduce intercompany borrowing by million and increase the capital level of the company s us insurance subsidiaries through capital contributions of million in cash  and  entering into agreements to sell several non core businesses and product lines on terms that result in increased statutory capital 
specifically  the company entered into agreements to divest its canadian branch operation  its majority interest in its subsidiary in argentina  and its income protection subsidiary in japan 
in the united states  it reinsured certain of its insurance policies distributed through associations 
the cumulative result of these efforts was to restore the company s risk based capital ratio to percent as of december  with the anticipated closing of the sale of the canadian operation in the first half of  the company expects that its risk based capital ratio will be approximately percent  the highest level since the merger of unum and provident 
key elements to success in the company s us brokerage group income protection business are appropriate underwriting and pricing 
beginning in the second half of  the company instituted more disciplined underwriting and pricing for both new and renewal business in this line 
while this approach is believed to be best for the long term  it may result in lower sales and or lower persistency of existing business in the near term 
the 
table of contents company s underwriting and pricing strategy may place it in a somewhat competitive disadvantage in the near term  although it is believed that it will produce improved profit margins over time 
while price will always be a paramount factor in buying decisions  the company believes that its products  services  and prices  taken as a whole  give it a competitive position 
these steps are intended to position the company to benefit from a recovering economy and are discussed throughout item despite these improvements in  the company s us brokerage group income protection business line continued to perform below expectations 
the key actions to restore the us brokerage group income protection profitability include shifting emphasis from revenue growth to profit margin expansion in this line  raising prices and remaining more disciplined in risk selection  restoring a more balanced mix of business between small  medium  and large employer customers  shifting the company s focus from large case business which is often more price sensitive and vulnerable to weak economic conditions  and  improving the cost structure of the company and lowering the expense ratios 
while taking the actions needed to restore profitability in the company s us brokerage group income protection business  the company intends to continue to maintain  if not improve upon  the performance in its other lines of business and subsidiaries 
the company s expectation is that over time the us brokerage group income protection results will improve  and other areas will become more significant contributors to the company s overall results 
the remaining sections of item discuss the critical accounting policies  significant transactions and events  segment operating results  discontinued operations  consolidated investments  liquidity and capital resources  current debt and financial strength ratings  and other pertinent information for the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein in item critical accounting policies reserves for policy and contract benefits the two primary categories of liabilities for policy and contract benefits are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred and have future benefits to be paid 
policy reserves equal the present value of the difference between future policy benefits and expenses and future premiums  allowing a margin for profit 
these reserves are applicable for the majority of the company s business  which is traditional non interest sensitive in nature 
the claim payments are estimated using assumptions established when the policy was issued 
throughout the life of the policy  the reserve is based on the original assumptions used for the policy s issue year 
ordinarily  generally accepted accounting principles require that these assumptions not be subsequently modified unless the policy reserves are determined to be inadequate 
a claim reserve is established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
policy reserves for a particular policy continue to be maintained after a claim reserve has been established for as long as the policy remains in force 
claim reserves generally equal the company s estimate  at the current reporting period  of the present value of the liability for future benefits and expenses to be paid on claims incurred as of that date 
a claim reserve for a specific claim is based on assumptions derived from the company s actual historical experience as to claim duration as well as the specific characteristics of the claimant such as benefits available under the policy  the covered benefit period  and the age and occupation of the claimant 
consideration is given to current and historical trends in the company s experience and to expected deviations from historical experience that result from changes in benefits available  changes in the company s risk management policies and procedures  and other economic  environmental  or societal factors 
reserves for claims that are estimated to have already been incurred but that have not yet been reported to the company are based on factors such as historical claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 

table of contents claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change 
in a reporting period  actual experience may deviate from the long term assumptions used to determine the claim reserves 
the company reviews annually  or more frequently as appropriate  emerging experience to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses 
the company s reserves for group and individual income protection products include a provision for future payments  other than legal expenses  on all claim related lawsuits for which the cause of action has already occurred 
this includes known lawsuits and those yet to be filed 
the reserve amount is the company s estimate of the payments on all such lawsuits based on past payments and expected future payments 
claim reserves on continuing operations  net of ceded reinsurance  were billion at december  claim reserves  in general  are an estimate of the current value of future  otherwise unfunded  benefit commitments or liabilities 
the calculation of claim reserves involves numerous assumptions 
in setting these assumptions  the company depends upon industry information and experience  company experience and analysis  and reasoned judgment 
there can be no guarantee that these assumptions individually  or collectively  will be duplicated by actual experience over time 
the primary assumptions related to claim reserves are the discount rate  the claim resolution rate  and the incidence rate for incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
the discount rate is the interest rate at which future benefit cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of those cash flows 
it is important since higher discount rates produce lower reserves 
if the discount rate is higher than future investment returns  the company s reserves will not earn sufficient investment income to support future liabilities 
in this case  the reserves will eventually be insufficient 
alternatively  if a discount rate is chosen that is too low relative to future investment results  the reserve  and thus the claim cost in the current period  will be overstated and profits will be accumulated in the reserves rather than released to current shareholders through earnings 
the company sets its discount rate assumptions very carefully in conjunction with the current and expected future investment income rate of the assets supporting the reserves 
if the investment yield at which new investments are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio  it is likely that the discount rate on new claims will be established below or above the discount rate on existing claims 
it is the company s intent to use a discount rate that provides some margin for adverse movement in the investment portfolio yield rate 
since policies may receive claim payments for a number of years  it is unlikely that the chosen discount rate assumption will prove to be accurate for any one policy  rather  the discount rate is chosen to apply to many claims with various characteristics of length and severity 
the company uses its experience and analysis of its existing claims and investment performance to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption 
actual claim reserves incurred in the calendar quarter are sensitive to the choice of discount rate 
for example  a basis point increase or decrease in the group long term income protection claim discount rate would have changed a quarter s incurred claim cost in by approximately million 
the claim resolution rate is the rate of probability that a disability claim will close or change due to maximum benefits being paid under the policy  the recovery or death of the insured  or a change in status in any given period 
it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim 
estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time 
a claim closes due to maximum benefits being paid if all of the contractual benefits under the policy have been paid 
a claim also closes if the policyholder recovers from his or her disability and is no longer receiving disability benefit payments or if the policyholder dies in the period 
a claim may change status during the period 
for example  a policyholder receiving disability benefits may return to part time work  and the claim benefit may be reduced to reflect the change to partial disability 
establishing claim resolution assumptions is very complex and involves many factors  including the cause of disability  the policyholder s age  the type of contractual benefits provided  etc 
claim resolution assumptions also vary by duration of disability and time since initially becoming disabled 
the company uses its extensive claim experience and analysis to develop its claim resolution assumptions 
claim resolution experience is studied over a number of years with more weight placed on the more recent experience 
claim resolution assumptions are established to represent the company s future resolution rate expectations 
due to the individual nature of each claim  it is unlikely that the claim resolution rate will be accurate for any particular claim 
the company establishes its claim resolution assumptions to apply as an average to its large base of active claims 
in this manner  the assumed rates are much more accurate over the broad base of claims 
actual claim reserves incurred in the calendar quarter are sensitive to the choice of resolution rate 
for example  a basis point increase or decrease in the group long term income protection claim resolution rate would have changed a quarter s incurred claim cost in by approximately million 

table of contents the company has liability for claims that have been incurred but not reported to the company and must establish a liability for these claims equal to the present value of the expected benefit payments 
in addition to the discount rate and claim resolution rate  the incidence rate is also a primary assumption in the ibnr reserve 
the incidence rate is the rate at which new claims per thousand insured lives are submitted to the company 
the incidence rate is affected by many factors including the age of the insured  the insured s occupation or industry  the benefit plan design  and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment 
the company establishes the incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations 
as the actual claims are reported and claim reserves are established  the accuracy of the ibnr emerges 
while the company expects its ibnr reserve to be appropriate over the long term  it will not always equal  in a particular reporting period  the actual reserve established for a reported claim 
for example  a basis point deviation in the actual incidence rate from that assumed in the ibnr reserve would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately million in claim reserves established during a quarter in  relative to the ibnr reserve previously established to cover those claims 
deferred policy acquisition costs the company defers certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortizes expenses these costs over the life of the related policies 
deferred costs include certain commissions  other agency compensation  selection and policy issue expenses  and field expenses 
acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business  such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy  are excluded from deferral 
the company uses its own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of its business in determining the expected life of the policies 
approximately percent of the company s deferred policy acquisition costs relate to traditional non interest sensitive products  for which the costs are amortized in proportion to the estimated premium income to be received over the life of the policies in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is higher than in the later years due to higher anticipated policy persistency in the early years  which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
amortization of deferred costs on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience 
the company will experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
deferred costs related to group and individual income protection products are amortized over a twenty year period  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs related to group income protection products expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
for individual income protection policies  approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
deferred costs for group life products are amortized over a fifteen year period  with approximately percent of the cost expected to be amortized by year ten 
deferred costs for group and individual long term care products are amortized over a twenty year period  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
due to the company s actual persistency experienced in recent years relative to what was expected when policies were issued  the company lowered its premium persistency assumptions for costs deferred in and for certain of its products to reflect the company s current estimate of persistency 
this accelerates the amortization of group income protection and group life acquisition costs deferred in those years into the early life of the policy 

table of contents valuation of fixed maturity securities in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  the company evaluates the following factors the probability of recovering principal and interest 
the company s ability and intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover 
whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments 
the significance of the decline in value 
the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value 
current and future business prospects and trends of earnings 
relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles 
market conditions 
rating agency actions 
bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity 
any other key measures for the related security 
the company s review procedures include  but are not limited to  biweekly meetings of certain members of the company s senior management personnel to review reports on the entire portfolio  identifying investments with changes in market value of five percent or more  investments with changes in rating either by external rating agencies or internal analysts  investments segmented by issuer  industry  and foreign exposure levels  and any other relevant investment information to help identify the company s exposure to possible credit losses 
based on this review of the entire investment portfolio  individual investments may be added to or removed from the company s watch list  which is a list of securities subject to enhanced monitoring and a more intensive review 
the company also determines if its investment portfolio is overexposed to an issuer that is showing warning signs of deterioration and  if so  the company makes no further purchases of that issuer s securities and may seek opportunities to sell securities it holds from that issuer to reduce the company s exposure 
the company monitors below investment grade securities as to individual exposures and in comparison to the entire portfolio as an additional credit risk management strategy  looking specifically at the company s exposure to individual securities currently classified as below investment grade 
in determining current and future business prospects and cash availability  the company considers the parental support of an issuer in its analysis but does not rely heavily on this support 
if the company determines that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period to the extent of the decline in value 
if the decline is considered temporary  the security continues to be carefully monitored 
these controls have been established to identify the company s exposure to possible credit losses and are intended to give the company the ability to respond rapidly 
the company has no held to maturity fixed maturity securities 
all fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
fair values are based on quoted market prices  where available 
private placement fixed maturity securities  including the fixed maturity securities reported as discontinued operations  had a carrying value of approximately billion  or percent of total fixed maturity securities at december  private placement fixed maturity securities do not have readily determinable market prices 
for these securities  the company uses internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
additionally  the company obtains prices from independent third party brokers to establish valuations for certain of these securities 
the company s ability to liquidate its positions in some of these securities could be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and the company may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
although the company believes its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  the key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active market 
the company believes that generally these private placement securities carry a credit quality comparable to companies rated baa or bbb by major credit rating organizations 

table of contents as of december   the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of private placement fixed maturity securities included the following risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 
current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points were added to the risk free rate to consider the lack of liquidity 
an additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments 
additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
increasing the basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by basis points  increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point  and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the december  net unrealized gain in the fixed maturity securities portfolio by approximately million 
historically  the company s realized gains or losses on dispositions of its private placement fixed maturity securities have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodology described above 
changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities  other than declines that are determined to be other than temporary  are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
if it is subsequently determined that any of these securities are other than temporarily impaired  the impairment loss is reported as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
the recognition of the impairment loss does not affect total stockholders equity to the extent that the decline in value had been previously reflected in other comprehensive income 
there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring the company s fixed maturity securities for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities the assessment of a borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change 
the economic outlook  either domestic or foreign  may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated  and as such  the security may not recover in value 
new information may become available concerning the security  such as disclosure of accounting irregularities  fraud  or corporate governance issues 
significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry 
adverse rating agency actions may occur 
reinsurance receivable reinsurance is a contractual agreement whereby the company s reinsurance partners assume a defined portion of the risk for future benefits payable under reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance receivable reported as an asset in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition includes amounts due from the company s reinsurers on current claims and estimates of amounts that will be due on future claims 
policy reserves and claim reserves reported in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition are not reduced for reinsurance 
the reinsurance receivable is generally equal to the policy reserves and claim reserves related to the risk being reinsured 
the company reduces the reinsurance receivable if recovery is not likely due to the financial position of the reinsurer or if there is disagreement between the company and the reinsurer regarding the liability of the reinsurer 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is not amortized  but the company reviews on an annual basis the carrying amount of goodwill for indications of impairment  with consideration given to financial performance and other relevant factors 
in accordance with accounting guidance  the company tests for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below 
in addition  certain events including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business environment  an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency  or unanticipated competition 
table of contents would cause the company to review goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually 
changes in the company s businesses  such as the sale of the canadian branch  may require impairment testing and can result in impairment 
changes in the company s reporting segments can change the level at which goodwill is tested and may result in an impairment of goodwill at the time the reporting segments are changed 
the goodwill reported as an asset in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition is attributable primarily to the acquisition of paul revere and relates to individual income protection business 
the impairment testing for the individual income protection goodwill involves estimating the fair value of the individual income protection block of business based upon the present value of future cash flows using assumptions as to future sales  morbidity experience  portfolio yield rate  and the rate of return at which the company believes the market would price the business for purchase 
adverse changes in any of these factors could result in an impairment of goodwill 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company s valuation allowance relates primarily to foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has considered forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company determines that it might not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability 
management believes that adequate accruals have been provided for all years  however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised could differ materially from the amount accrued

reserve strengthening in april  the company completed an analysis of its assumptions related to its group long term income protection claim reserves 
included in the analysis was a review of active claim reserves  ibnr reserves  and claim reopen reserves 
an active claim reserve is established for future benefit payments when a claim is incurred and reported to the company 
ibnr reserves are established on claims which are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
claim reopen reserves are established for those claimants who have previously recovered but who are anticipated to return to disabled status under the same disability and within a specified period of time  as contractually allowed by the disability policy 
the analysis was initiated based on lower claim resolution rates observed during the first quarter of the claim resolution rate is the rate of probability that a disability claimant will recover  die  or reach maximum benefit limits and no longer receive benefit payments from the company 
generally  claim resolution rates vary by the age of the claimant at the time of disability  duration or length of time since the disability initially occurred  and claim diagnosis 
the claim resolution rates for group long term income protection during the first quarter of were below levels anticipated for reserves and were lower 
table of contents than those experienced in the full years   and the analysis indicated not only a decrease in overall claim resolution rates  but also a change in claim resolution rates by claim duration 
the analysis of emerging claim resolution rates and the reasons driving the changes resulted in a reduction in the company s long term expectations with respect to claim resolution rates 
the company s long term expectations applied to all claims incurred regardless of the date of incurral 
in addition  the company reviewed the reserve discount rate  which is the interest rate at which future cash flows for benefit and expenses to be paid are discounted to determine the current value of those cash flows 
the company concluded at that time that a change in its discount rate assumptions was not warranted 
based on the april analysis  in the first quarter of the company increased its group long term income protection claim reserves by million before tax  or million after tax  to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations 
the active claim reserve for claims already reported to the company and still in open claim status was increased by million  the ibnr reserve was decreased by million  and the reopen reserve was decreased by million before tax 
the first quarter change represented a percent increase in total net group long term income protection reserves as of march   which for continuing operations equaled billion prior to this increase and equaled billion as of december  in january  the company completed its annual review of claim reserves to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses 
based upon this review  as of december   the company increased its group long term income protection claim reserves by million and its group short term income protection claim reserves by million  for a total increase of million before tax and million after tax 
approximately million of the reserve strengthening reflected implementation of a lower discount rate for the company s group income protection claim reserves 
the discount rate was lowered to reflect the company s actual change in investment portfolio yield rates during  the expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates  and the company s new discount rate management approach of maintaining a wider spread between its group income protection portfolio investment yield rate and its average discount rate

the company focuses on integrated selling and expects that this organizational focus on customers will continue to favorably affect sales growth  but management intends to maintain pricing discipline to balance sales growth and profitability  which may slow the rate of long term sales growth 
the company also utilizes an agency field sales force to market the products offered by its colonial segment

operating income or operating loss excludes net realized investment gains and losses  income tax  results of discontinued operations  and cumulative effects of accounting principle changes

a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these non gaap financial measures of operating revenue and operating income or operating loss differ from revenue and income loss from continuing operations before income tax and cumulative effect of accounting principle changes as presented in the company s consolidated operating results reported herein and in income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of before tax realized investment gains and losses 
the company measures segment performance for purposes of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  excluding realized investment gains and losses because management believes that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses 
the company s investment focus is on investment income to support its insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses  and a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and not necessarily related to decisions regarding the underlying business of the company s segments 
however  income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of the company s overall profitability 
due to factors discussed under risk factors investments contained herein in item and the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities  as discussed in a subsequent section of this management s discussion and analysis  the company may experience realized investment losses 
the realization of investment gains and losses will affect future earnings levels as the underlying business is long term in nature and requires that the company be able to earn the assumed interest rates in its liabilities

sales year ended december  compared with year ended december  group long term income protection sales on a fully insured basis decreased percent during compared to the slight net decline occurred in the company s us market  with a decline in the large employer market more than offsetting growth in the small and mid employer markets 
sales increased in the mid employer market during as the company began to shift its focus to this market  which is comprised of groups of to  lives 
the decrease in the us sales was partially offset by growth of percent in the company s united kingdom operations 
the company also offers accounts handled on an administrative services only aso basis  with the risk and responsibility for funding claim payments remaining with the customer 
the company reports the fee income on aso business in other income 
for aso business  sales increased percent for group long term income protection relative to the prior year 
group short term income protection sales for fully insured business decreased percent while the aso business decreased percent in compared to the comparative decline for versus in short term income protection aso sales was primarily due to a large case sold in 
table of contents sales for individual income protection decreased percent in relative to the prior year 
sales increased percent in the company s brokerage voluntary income protection line of business  offset by declines in the company s united kingdom operations and in the company s us operations for non voluntary income protection 
the sales decline occurred primarily in the us individual sales market rather than in the multi life market 
the portion of the individual income protection sales attributable to multi life business in the company s us operations was approximately percent of sales and percent for full year sales 
sales for group long term care increased percent over the prior year  while sales for individual long term care decreased percent 
as previously discussed  during  the company introduced a new distribution model for the sale of individual income protection and individual long term care insurance products which will enable the company to maintain its focus on workplace customers and increased integration between individual multi life and group offerings 
the company also introduced changes in the individual long term care product offering during these actions may slow the growth in sales of non multi life individual income protection and individual long term care insurance relative to historical trends 
the company expects that the rate of sales growth for both group and individual income protection products may decline due to the current competitive pricing environment 
the company intends to continue to emphasize premium growth through a balance of new sales  renewal programs  and persistency of the existing block of business  but no assurance can be given that such premium growth will occur or be sustainable 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  fully insured sales for group long term income protection increased million in compared to the prior year 
the company s us operations reported a decrease of percent  partially offset by a percent sales increase in the company s united kingdom operations 
sales in the us operations declined in all case size markets  with the largest percentage decrease occurring in the small employer market 
fully insured sales for short term income protection were down percent in compared to the prior year due to a decline in sales in all case size markets 
sales for short term income protection aso increased percent compared to persistency and renewal of existing business the company monitors persistency of its existing business and reflects adverse changes in persistency in the current period s amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
one way in which the company monitors persistency is at the overall block of business level ie  group long term income protection  group short term income protection  and individual income protection 
persistency  at the overall block of business level  is the year to date rate at which existing business for all issue years in the block of business at the beginning of the period remains inforce at the end of the period 
in determining whether additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is required due to adverse persistency  the company measures persistency by issue year ie  the rate at which existing business for that specific issue year at the beginning of the period remains inforce at the end of the period 
the rate of persistency for an overall block of business may improve while individual issue years within the overall block of business may deteriorate and require additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
persistency during for the overall block of group long term income protection on average improved from that experienced in persistency for fully insured short term income protection also improved  on average  over the prior year 
persistency for short term income protection aso business declined relative to during and  persistency for group long term and short term income protection was lower for certain issue years when compared to the persistency expected at the time the business was written 
this resulted in additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of million in and million in for group income protection 
there was no additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in since the company s actual persistency experienced in recent years was lower than that expected when policies were issued  the company lowered its premium persistency assumptions for costs deferred in and to reflect its current estimate of persistency 
this accelerates the amortization of group long term and short term income protection acquisition costs deferred in those years into the early life of the policy by using lower premium persistency assumptions to determine the scheduled or expected amortization 
although persistency in the future may be lower than historical levels  particularly in certain issue years due to the company s increased emphasis on retaining profitable business  the acceleration of scheduled 
table of contents amortization may eliminate the need for additional amortization related to the decline in actual persistency relative to scheduled or expected persistency 
the persistency of individual income protection and long term care continues to be within expected levels 
the company s renewal programs have generally been successful at retaining group income protection business that is relatively more profitable than business that terminated 
it is expected that the additional premium and related profits associated with renewal activity will continue to emerge 
the company intends to maintain a disciplined approach in the re pricing of renewal business  while balancing the need to maximize persistency and retain producer relationships 
this disciplined approach may lead to lower persistency or lower profit margins on affected renewal cases than originally planned 
group income protection operating results as discussed under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the company s group income protection business 
components of claims experience  including  but not limited to  incidence levels and claims duration  may be worse than expected 
management monitors claims experience in group income protection and responds to changes by periodically adjusting prices  refining underwriting guidelines  changing product features  and strengthening risk management policies and procedures 
the company expects to price new business and re price existing business  at contract renewal dates  in an attempt to mitigate the effect of these and other factors  including interest rates  on new claim liabilities 
given the competitive market conditions for the company s income protection products  it is uncertain whether pricing actions can entirely mitigate the effect 
the company  similar to all financial institutions  has some exposure in a severe and prolonged economic recession  but many of the company s products can be re priced  which would allow the company to reflect in its pricing any fundamental change which might occur in the risk associated with a particular industry or company within an industry 
although approximately percent of the company s overall block of group income protection business is in the manufacturing and wholesale retail industry segments  which tend to be economically sensitive  the company has a well diversified book of insurance exposure  with no disproportionate concentrations of risk in any one industry 
the company has also made changes in recent years through the application of best practices in the claims organization and believes it can respond to increased levels of submitted claims which might result from a further slowing economy

table of contents operating revenue for group income protection improved due to increases in both premium income and net investment income 
the million growth in premium income during compared to the prior year is due to new sales growth in and favorable renewal activity and improved persistency on the existing block of business 
also contributing to premium growth was the acquisition of the united kingdom group income protection business of sun life  as previously discussed 
premium income in the company s united kingdom group long term income protection business increased percent  or million  in relative to a portion of that reported growth also resulted from the favorable foreign currency exchange rate in relative to when measured in pounds sterling  the growth rate in premium income in the united kingdom s group long term income protection was approximately percent year over year

persistency during on the overall block of group income protection improved over  with group long term income protection persistency on the company s us business at percent compared to percent in group short term income protection persistency for was percent versus percent for the year a critical part of the company s strategy for group income protection involves executing its renewal program and managing persistency in its existing block of business  both of which management expects to have a positive effect on future profitability 
the company has implemented a pricing strategy in the group income protection line wherein prices may increase or decrease by market segment  as appropriate  to respond to current claim experience and other factors and assumptions  although pricing changes typically lag the changes in actual claim experience by several quarters 
the benefit ratio for group income protection increased from percent in to percent in excluding the impact of the reserve strengthening for group income protection  the benefit ratio was percent for group income protection experienced a decrease in its commission ratio  offset by an increase in operating expenses 
there was no additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to persistency for  but expected amortization  as determined when the costs were initially capitalized  continues to increase year over year due to the continued growth in the deferred policy acquisition cost asset balance related to new sales growth in the block of business and acceleration of expected amortization for costs capitalized in and subsequent years

the benefit ratio for group income protection was higher than in  with the increase attributable to long term income protection

for short term income protection  the benefit ratio was higher than in paid claim incidence was higher in than in  but lower during the fourth quarter of relative to the second and third quarters of the average weekly indemnity and premium per life continued to increase as expected  but the growth in premium per life was greater than the growth in the average weekly indemnity compared to the growth level relationships experienced in the average claim duration for closed short term income protection claims was higher than in year ended december  compared with year ended december  group income protection operating revenue was  million in compared to  million in group income protection reported operating income of million for compared to million for

although this strategy may cause a somewhat lower persistency or market share  historically the profitability of business that terminates has generally been less than the profitability of retained business 
the company also expects that its income protection product results will benefit if there is an improvement in overall economic conditions and a higher interest rate environment  although the improvement in results may lag behind the improvements in the economy and interest rate environment

sales sales for group life decreased percent from due to a decrease in sales in the company s us operations  partially offset by an increase in sales in the united kingdom operations 
the decline in us group life sales is primarily attributable to lower large case sales and the continuing impact of the company s strategic decision  which was fully implemented during  to focus on integrated sales of life and income protection and less on stand alone life sales 
the increase in the united kingdom sales is partially due to the inclusion of additional sales generated as a result of the sun life acquisition

there was no additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in as previously discussed in the operating segment results for group income protection and as also applicable to group life and accidental death and dismemberment  the company has accelerated the amortization of costs pertaining to certain of its lines of business into the early life of the policy by using lower premium persistency assumptions in determining its scheduled or expected amortization 
although persistency in the future may be lower than historical levels  particularly in certain issue years due to the company s increased emphasis on retaining profitable business  the acceleration of 
table of contents scheduled amortization may eliminate the need for additional amortization related to the deterioration of actual persistency relative to scheduled or expected persistency 
group life and accidental death and dismemberment reported a million increase in operating income for compared to the prior year 
the increase was partially attributable to a decrease in the benefit ratio for both group life and accidental death and dismemberment in relative to group life and accidental death and dismemberment reported a lower commission ratio and a flat operating expense ratio for relative to the prior year

the growth in operating income was due to the increase in revenue and a lower benefit ratio 
the commission and operating expense ratios were slightly higher in compared to the prior year  partially eroding the profit margin 
segment outlook the company considers the group life and accidental death and dismemberment products as being complimentary to its group income protection products 
sales of stand alone group life  without additional lines of coverage  are not a focus of the company 
sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment are expected to be relatively flat with levels and  like group income protection  will be primarily focused on a more balanced mix of sales between large  medium  and small employer markets 
the company intends to continue its disciplined approach to risk selection and pricing 
since the group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are primarily sold in conjunction with group income protection  the more focused renewal effort in group income protection is expected to reduce persistency somewhat in the group life line as well 
the benefit ratio is expected to remain relatively flat with the prior year 
the company will continue to concentrate on sales growth and increased profitability for its voluntary brokerage and other lines and expects that the sales growth pattern of recent years will continue during

investments overview investment activities are an integral part of the company s business  and profitability is significantly affected by investment results 
invested assets are segmented into portfolios that support the various product lines 
generally  the investment strategy for the portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of the company s business 
the company seeks to maximize investment income and total return and to assume credit risk in a prudent and selective manner  subject to constraints of quality  liquidity  diversification  and regulatory considerations 
the company s overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of its insurance products 
assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities  and the portfolio is matched with liabilities so as to eliminate as much as possible the company s exposure to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
the company invests for the long term  with the weighted average duration of its liability portfolio approximately years at december  the weighted average duration of the company s investment portfolio was years at december   and the weighted average credit rating was a 
the company is able to hold to this investment philosophy throughout a credit cycle because of its capital position  the fixed nature of its liabilities  and the matching of those liabilities with assets and also because of the experience gained through many years of a consistent investment philosophy 
it is the company s intent  and has been its practice  to hold investments to maturity to meet liability payments 
the company s investment philosophy is also designed to take advantage of the expertise it has developed over the years in the below investment grade fixed maturity market 
this allows the company to attain higher yield and increase diversification of assets while at the same time not substantially increasing its asset risk profile 
as noted in the investment policy discussion below  the company s investments in this asset category are subject to limits and closely monitored 

table of contents below is a summary of the company s formal investment policy  including the overall quality and diversification objectives 
the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of the company s portfolios 
the long term nature of the company s insurance liabilities also allows it to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns 
a maximum of percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below investment grade investments  two percent in equity type instruments  and up to percent in private placements 
the remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investment grade corporate securities  mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities  municipal securities  and commercial mortgages 
the company does not currently intend to invest in additional real estate 
the company intends to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities to within a range of years 
the weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be bbb or higher 
the maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits established by the company s board of directors and is more restrictive than the percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments the company s insurance subsidiaries are allowed to own 
these internal limits are as follows rating internal limit in millions aaa a bbb bbb bb bbb bb b bb b the portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines 
derivative instruments may be used to hedge interest rate risk and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan approved by the board of directors 
asset mix guidelines and limits are established by the company and approved by the board of directors 
the allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification by the investment subcommittee of the board of directors on a weekly basis 
these actions are also reviewed and approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
these investment policies and guidelines are reviewed and appropriately adjusted by the board of directors annually  or more frequently if deemed necessary 
to allow the company flexibility during the current challenging environment  the board of directors at its september meeting modified the above investment guidelines to establish an individual credit over exposure limit at percent of invested assets and a below investment grade over exposure limit of percent of invested assets

the company s current view of risk factors relative to these four industries is as follows financial institutions this sector entered the recent economic slowdown with record capital levels and strong profitability 
bank balance sheets withstood the increased loan write offs through the recent economic cycle 
credit quality is now beginning to improve in the financial services sector 
in general  fourth quarter of results showed little or no loan growth  stabilizing net interest margins  well managed risk positions in corporate lending  and overall improvement in asset quality 
profitability is strong at most banks  brokers  and finance companies 
transportation this sector consists of airlines  airports  railroads  and shipping 
the overall sector has encountered significant difficulties during the past two years  primarily in commercial aviation 
global and domestic economic weakness  war  and terrorism related fears have contributed to reductions in demand for air travel 
high cost structures and over leveraged balance sheets at many of the airlines have also contributed to the deterioration of credit quality for many issuers of securities 
the outlook for the airline airport segment depends heavily on economic improvement  negotiations with labor unions  and continued expense reductions 
demand for railroad and shipping services is also highly correlated to the economy 
us government agencies and municipalities this sector includes the us government treasury department  government agencies  and government sponsored enterprises 
the increase in us treasury interest rates during the third quarter of adversely affected the market value of the company s holdings in this sector 
the sector has minimal credit risk and excellent liquidity  which enables the company to maintain a higher limitation on investments in these subsectors 
utilities this sector  which includes regulated electric utilities  gas transmission and distribution companies  and independent power projects  is showing signs of improvement from the difficult environment that has existed over the past few years 
many companies are de emphasizing merchant power and energy trading operations and focusing instead on their core businesses 
balance sheets are being strengthened through the sale of non core assets and the repayment of debt 
several companies with liquidity problems have either renewed bank facilities or obtained other forms of new financing 
however  significant challenges still remain for parts of this industry 
there 
table of contents is power generation over capacity in several parts of the us where supply may exceed demand for several years 
those power plants whose main fuel supply is natural gas will continue to experience deteriorating margins due to the high cost of that commodity 
a number of investigations and court rulings have been resolved due to the western states power crisis in and  but several still remain outstanding  which could result in negative outcomes for certain utility companies 
of the million in gross unrealized losses at december   million  or percent  are related to investment grade fixed maturity bonds 
unrealized losses on investment grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities 
these changes are generally temporary and are not recognized as realized investment losses unless the securities are sold or become other than temporarily impaired 
the gross unrealized loss on below investment grade fixed maturity bonds was million at december   or percent  of the total gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity bonds 
generally  below investment grade fixed maturity securities are more likely to develop credit concerns 
the following table shows the length of time the company s investment grade fixed maturity bonds had been in a gross unrealized loss position as of december  the company has no unrealized losses in its canadian branch fixed maturity bond portfolio

table of contents as previously discussed under critical accounting policies contained herein  in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  the company utilizes a formal  well defined  and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate its fixed income investment portfolio 
it includes certain members of senior management in addition to the company s other investment and accounting professionals 
the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and write downs on a timely basis of investments determined to have an other than temporary impairment 
for those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss and on which the company has not recorded an impairment write down  the company believes that the decline in fair value below amortized cost is temporary 
the company has the ability to hold its securities to the earlier of recovery or maturity and intends to hold all of its fixed maturity investments until maturity to meet its liability obligations 
if information becomes available that changes the company s assessment as to whether the company will receive contractual payments related to a fixed maturity security and the security is also not projected to recover in value  the related security is generally sold 
the company may also in certain circumstances sell a security because of industry or environmental issues  to extend the duration of the investment portfolio  in response to mergers between issuers or other events which result in positions in excess of the company s investment guidelines  and to take advantage of tender offers

at december   the mortgage backed securities had an average life of years and effective duration of years 
the mortgage backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities 
the primary risk involved in investing in mortgage backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment 
the company uses models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the company has not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities at december   was  million  representing percent of the fair value of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans and fixed maturity securities reported as discontinued operations  below the company s internal limit for this type of investment 
the comparable measure at december  was  million or percent 
as previously discussed  the company initiated a program during the first quarter of to reduce its risk exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities 
below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
the company expects that additional downgrades of investment grade securities may occur during  but the company does not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by its investments in below investment grade securities  nor does it expect these investments to adversely affect its ability to hold its other investments to maturity

interest lost on restructured loans was immaterial for and real estate was million and million at december  and  respectively 
investment real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
real estate acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure and may be classified as investment real estate if it meets the company s investment criteria 
if investment real estate is determined to be permanently impaired  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to fair value 
occasionally  investment real estate is reclassified to real estate held for sale when it no longer meets the company s investment criteria 
real estate held for sale  which is valued net of a valuation allowance that reduces the carrying value to the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell  amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company uses a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of each mortgage loan and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation 
the company establishes an investment valuation allowance for mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio  considering the value of the underlying collateral 
investment valuation allowances for real estate held for sale are established based on a review of specific assets 
if a decline in value of a mortgage loan or real estate investment is considered to be other than temporary or if the asset is deemed permanently impaired  the investment is reduced to estimated net realizable value  and the reduction is recognized as a realized investment loss 
management monitors the risk associated with these invested asset portfolios and regularly reviews and adjusts the investment valuation allowance 
at december   the balance in the valuation allowances for real estate was million 
no valuation allowance was held for mortgage loans at december  derivatives historically  the company has utilized interest rate futures contracts  current and forward interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  and options on forward interest rate swaps  forward treasuries  or forward contracts on specific fixed income securities to manage duration and increase yield on cash flows expected from current holdings and future premium income 
positions under the company s hedging programs for derivative activity that were open during involved current and forward interest rate swaps  forward contracts on credit spreads on specific fixed income securities  and currency swaps which are used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency denominated fixed income securities 
the company also opened certain currency forward contracts to hedge the anticipated foreign currency proceeds from the sale of the canadian branch 
all transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative 
almost all transactions are associated with the individual and group long term care and the 
table of contents individual and group income protection product portfolios 
all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes 
during  the company recognized net gains of million on the termination of cash flow hedges and reported million in other comprehensive income loss and million as a component of realized investment gains and losses 
the company amortized million of net deferred gains into net investment income during the company s current credit exposure on derivatives  which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position  was million at december  additions and terminations  in notional amounts  to the company s hedging programs for  were  million and  million  respectively 
the notional amount of derivatives outstanding under the hedge programs was  million at december  during  the company took advantage of the rise in interest rates and the steepening of the yield curve to hedge future period cash flows in the company s individual long term care and individual income protection product lines 
approximately billion of forward starting interest rate swaps receive fixed were executed at average expected yields in excess of 
these transactions produced a margin of to basis points above the company s reserve discount rates and lengthened the duration of the company s investment portfolio by approximately years 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s use of derivatives 
non current investments the company s exposure to non current investments totaled million at december   or percent of invested assets from continuing operations  excluding ceded policy loans

approximately million of these investments had principal and interest payments past due for a period greater than one year 
other the company has an investment program wherein it simultaneously enters into repurchase agreement transactions and reverse repurchase agreement transactions with the same party 
the company nets the related receivables and payables in the consolidated statements of financial condition as these transactions meet the requirements for the right of offset 
as of december   the company had million face value of these agreements in an open position that were offset 
the company also uses the repurchase agreement market as a source of short term financing 
the company had no contracts for this purpose outstanding at december  liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations  principally in its insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
the company s offerings of debt and or securities  as discussed under debt and capital  provide an additional source of liquidity 
cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  and taxes  as well as purchases of new investments 
the company has established an investment strategy that management believes will provide for adequate cash flows from operations 
the company s policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments  and the company therefore has minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities 
the company s cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for the company s insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims 
cash flow could also be negatively impacted by a deterioration in the credit market whereby the company s ability to liquidate its positions in certain of its fixed maturity securities would be impacted such that the company might not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
the company s cash resources are sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for the next twelve months

the ceding reinsurer will retain the assets backing the statutory disabled life reserves and will credit interest at a percent effective annual rate to the company 
this cash disbursement is included in cash flows from operations 
excluding this transfer  cash flows from operations were  million for the year ended december  operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income  offset by payments of claims  commissions  expenses  and income taxes 
premium income growth is attributable not only to new sales  but to renewals of existing business  renewal price increases  and stable persistency 
investment income growth is due to the growth in the underlying assets supporting the company s insurance reserves  somewhat offset by a decline in portfolio yield rates 
the growth in commissions and operating expenses is attributable primarily to new sales growth and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business 
the increase in paid claims is due partially to the continued growth and aging of the block of business and also to the general economy  as previously discussed in the operating results by segment

other information pension and postretirement benefit plans the company maintains separate us and foreign pension plans and a us post retirement benefit plan 
the us pension plans comprise the majority of the total benefit obligation and pension expense for the company 
the value of the benefit obligations is determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent the company s best estimate of future expected experience 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
two of the economic assumptions  the discount rate and the long term rate of return  are adjusted accordingly based on key external indices 
the assumptions chosen for us pension plans and the us postretirement plan use consistent methodology but reflect the differences in the plan obligations 
the company follows statements of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas  no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  and no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas in its financial reporting and accounting for its pension and post retirement benefit plans 
the discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value 
the discount rate was determined based on a review of long term fixed income securities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
in setting the assumption  the company also has considered the change in the level of interest rates on these securities since the prior year end and the duration of the fixed income indices relative to the duration of the plans liabilities 
historically  the company has used the moody s aa corporate bond index as one of the primary benchmarks in selecting a discount rate 
as of december    and  this index was percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the company has estimated that the duration of the index is approximately years 
the majority of the obligations in the us pension plans  however  is related to active and deferred vested employees  and duration  therefore  is significantly longer  at approximately years 
the company therefore adjusted the moody s index upward by approximately basis points to arrive at the discount rate assumption of percent  percent  and percent as of december    and  respectively 
studies matching the benefit cash flows of the pension plans to publicly traded bonds supported the rates assumed by the company 
using a similar methodology applied to the 
table of contents postretirement plan cash flows  a discount rate of percent was used as of december  the discount rate for the postretirement plan as of december  and was the same as that used for the us pension plans 
lowering the discount rate by percent would have increased the pension expense for the us pension plans by million and would be expected to result in an million increase in the pension plan expense 
the long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid 
for   and  the long term return on asset assumption for the us pension plans is percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the determination of the best estimate is based on a building block approach 
this methodology examines the various elements of the expected return for each asset class  such as inflation  dividends  real return  and risk premium 
the expected return for each asset class is calculated as the sum of the individual components 
the total expected return for the portfolio equals the weighted average of the return for each asset class  based on the plan s asset allocation 
during  the company revised the investment policy which resulted in a target asset allocation of percent equities and percent fixed income securities as compared to a target asset allocation of percent equities and percent fixed income securities in the expected long term rate of return assumption for the us pension plans in is percent 
this assumption is based on a weighted average expected return of approximately percent annually for fixed income investments and percent annually for equities  which equates to a weighted average return of percent 
the company s expectations for future investment returns in the plans are based on a combination of historical market performance and the company s evaluation of investment forecasts prepared by outside consultants and economists 
since  the average real return before inflation has been approximately percent for equities and percent for bonds 
the company has not relied extensively on the historical market performance of the us pension plans in setting the expected long term rate of return assumption 
this is because the current plan is composed of three plans that were merged to create one plan in furthermore  in  annuities were purchased for all existing retirees 
due to the nature of these changes  the historical performance of these plans is not a reliable indicator of future expected performance 
in calculating the average return over the lifetime of the plan  the duration of the projected benefit obligation  at approximately years  also has been considered  as well as the effect of active management of the plans assets 
for the us pension plans  the actual asset allocation at december  was percent equities and percent fixed income securities 
the company adopted a new investment policy in december  as previously discussed  and began rebalancing the asset mix of the investment portfolio at that time 
the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of large  mid  small  and convertible equity securities  as well as core and high yield fixed income securities 
the company uses a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on pension plan assets 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets by percent would have increased the pension expense by approximately million 
for  lowering the assumption by percent would increase pension expense by approximately million 
the market related value equals the fair value of assets  determined as of the measurement date 
the assets are not smoothed for purposes of sfas the expected return on assets  therefore  fully recognizes all asset gains and losses through the measurement date 
the company holds an unrecognized net gain or loss representing cumulative liability and asset gains and losses that have not been recognized in pension expense 
as of december   there was an estimated unrecognized loss of approximately million in the us pension plans 
as of december  and  the unrecognized loss was million and million  respectively 
the unrecognized loss has increased due to asset market value losses that occurred during and and the drop in the year end discount rate from percent at  to percent at  and to percent at the unrecognized net gain or loss is amortized in the pension expense 
only amounts outside of a corridor equal to percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market related value of assets are amortized 
the pension expense is expected to include a loss amortization of approximately million 
this loss amortization was million in and million in in  the pension expense included gain amortization of million 
the us pension plans experienced a negative pension expense in and that increased before tax income in the amount of million and million  respectively  in each of those years 
in  the company experienced a pension expense of million that decreased before tax income 

table of contents the end of the year value of the assets in the funded us pension plans declined from million in to million in and increased to million in the decrease in assets  coupled with the liability increase due to declining discount rates  has reduced the year end funding level in the plan from a surplus of million in to a deficit of million in and a deficit of million as of december  the company contributes to the us pension plans in accordance with the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
the company was not required to make a minimum required contribution in  nor will it be required to make a contribution in based on projections performed by the company s actuaries  it is anticipated that contributions will be required in and or the company may decide to contribute an amount above the minimum required contribution 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
the company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk the operations of the company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  primarily long term us interest rates 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments 
the company uses interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  exchange traded interest rate futures contracts  and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be billion at december  and the fair values of mortgage loans  which are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost  would decrease by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  assuming a basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels  the fair values of the company s long term debt  including junior subordinated debt  would increase approximately million and million  respectively 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a matrix pricing system whereby all securities were priced with the resulting market rates and spreads assuming a change of basis points 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values of long term debt  including junior subordinated debt  were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because the company actively manages its investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 

table of contents foreign currency risk the company is also subject to foreign exchange risk arising from its continuing foreign operations and certain investment securities denominated in those local currencies 
continuing foreign operations represented percent and percent of total assets at december  and  respectively  and percent and percent of total revenue for and  respectively 
assuming foreign exchange rates decreased percent from the december  and levels  year end and stockholders equity would not be materially affected
