d our definition of ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a measurement defined by gaap and has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  
table of contents ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on any debts we may have  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  ebitda does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally 
we have presented ebitda  however  because we believe it is an indicative measure of  and it is commonly used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and a company s ability to service and or incur debt 
furthermore  our executive compensation plans base incentive compensation payments on our ebitda performance measured against budget 
ebitda is also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisitions 
our computation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate retail party supplies stores within the continental united states and we sell franchises on an individual store and area franchise basis throughout the united states and puerto rico 
at july   our network consisted of stores  with stores owned by us and stores owned by franchisees 
we report two segments retail and franchising 
the retail segment generates revenue primarily through the sale of third party branded party goods through company owned stores 
the franchising segment generates revenue through the imposition of an initial one time franchise fee and ongoing royalty payments based on retail sales 
currently  the retail party supplies business has been fragmented  with consumers purchasing party related products from single owner operated and regional party supplies stores and designated departments in drug stores  general mass merchandisers  supermarkets and department stores of local  regional and national chains 
we offer customers a one stop party store that provides a wide selection of merchandise at a compelling value and in sufficient quantities to satisfy customer needs for parties of virtually all sizes and types 
we continually strive to improve customer satisfaction and strengthen our financial condition 
we have recently undertaken various initiatives to make fundamental improvements in our business  profitability and cash flows 
these initiatives have primarily focused on our breadth and quality of products  product pricing  financial  distribution and inventory systems  and employee base 
with respect to our products  we are developing proprietary processes to evaluate and select our product assortments more efficiently and effectively 
we are also reconfiguring our in store product layout to better align product themes and facilitate an easier shopping experience for our customers 
additionally  we continue to make advances in our inventory reduction initiative which is designed to reduce overall inventory levels while increasing inventory availability to stores 
our item reduction  vendor rationalization and product allocation strategies have facilitated an average per store inventory reduction of from june  to july  and are a significant reason for the increase in our cash and cash equivalents from million at june  to million at july  this inventory reduction has also resulted in an increase of inventory turnover 
we believe these strategies will continue to provide us with the flexibility to provide fresh merchandise choices to our customers and still maintain a sufficient variety and quantity of products to satisfy customer needs 
phase i of the logistics initiative  which will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal  will support weekly scheduling of store deliveries  thereby reducing store labor requirements and improving inventory accuracy 
we are now able to receive and distribute our products for our company owned stores from two distribution centers one in california and one in pennsylvania  and also initiated a preferred carrier process earlier this fiscal year resulting in lower negotiated transportation rates  better visibility on deliveries and higher service levels 
we have also focused on enhancing our enterprise systems  with the upgrade of our store and corporate systems fully implemented 
the investment in our enterprise systems has improved certain store processes  and will provide the systemic foundation for our logistics initiative 
working with our vendor partners and third party logistics providers  we are embarking on enhancements that will further drive product in stock positions and lower our supply chain network costs 
underlying these and other important initiatives are key investments we have made in our employee base  including the implementation of training programs related to customer service 
during fiscal  we filled a number of positions that were essential for our strategic transition 
this included appointing nancy pedot as our permanent chief executive officer  and hiring a new chief operating officer  chief merchandising officer  vice president of finance  creative director and director of training 
we also added people in key departments that had been understaffed  including merchandising  planning and allocation and logistics 
in connection with the implementation of these initiatives  we have incurred significant initial expenses that are disproportionate to our sales performance 
however  we anticipate these initial expenses will diminish 
table of contents over time 
most importantly  these investment initiatives are anticipated to improve customer experience and solidify brand recognition which we believe will ultimately result in increased sales  reduced expenses and  accordingly  greater net income 
key performance indicators and statistics we use a number of key indicators of financial condition and operating results to evaluate the performance of our business  including the following year ended july  june  june  net sales in thousands total company owned store count average net same store sales per company owned stores current period in thousands same store average net sale per retail transaction a same store net sales growth gross profit as a percent of net sales store profit contribution as a percent of net sales diluted earnings per share ebitda b in thousands a same store sales divided by same store retail transactions 
retail transactions represent each time a customer makes a purchase or return at the register 
b see ebitda discussion on page for further discussion of these key indicators  see part ii  item results of operations beginning on page critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results generally do not differ materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
merchandise inventory 
inventory is valued using the cost method which values inventory at the lower of the actual cost or market  at the individual item level 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
inventory levels are reviewed to identify slow moving and closeout merchandise that will no longer be carried 
market is determined by the estimated net realizable value  based upon the merchandise selling price 
we also estimate amounts of current inventories that will ultimately become obsolete due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 

table of contents finite long lived assets 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of finite long lived assets  we perform an analysis by store of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
insurance accruals 
our consolidated balance sheets include liabilities with respect to self insured workers compensation and general liability claims 
we estimated the required liability of such claims dated july   utilizing an actuarial method based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
goodwill 
all of our goodwill is associated with our retail segment 
we evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
a change in these underlying assumptions may cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying value 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
sales returns 
we estimate future sales returns and  when material  record a provision in the period that the related sales are recorded based on historical information 
should actual returns differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise estimated sales returns 
store closure costs 
we record estimated store closure costs  estimated lease commitment costs net of estimated sublease income and other miscellaneous store closing costs  when the liability is incurred 
such estimates  including sublease income  may be subject to change 
income taxes 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management s estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if our actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  new store locations or tax planning  our effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected

 accounting for asset retirement obligations fasb no 

this interpretation clarifies the scope and timing of liability recognition for conditional asset retirement obligations under fasb no 
and is effective no later than the end of fiscal we have determined that this interpretation  and the adoption of fasb no 
 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows

and no

seasonality our business is subject to substantial seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our net sales  cash flow and net income in the second fiscal quarter of the year principally due to the sales in october for the halloween season and  to a lesser extent  due to holiday sales for end of year holidays 
we expect that this general pattern will continue 
our results of operations and cash flows may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of new store openings and store closings and the timing of the acquisition and disposition of stores 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to interest rate change and market risk 
we generally borrow only during certain times of the year as our borrowing patterns are cyclical 
therefore  a sudden increase in interest rates which under the loan agreement is dependent on  at our option  i at the adjusted eurodollar rate per annum  plus the applicable margin which is currently or ii at the prime rate per annum  less the applicable margin which is currently totaling at july  may  during peak borrowing  have a negative impact on short term results 
we believe that our interest rate risk is minimal as a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates in the associated debt s variable rate would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows
